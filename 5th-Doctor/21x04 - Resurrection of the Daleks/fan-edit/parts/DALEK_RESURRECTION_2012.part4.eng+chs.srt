一旦博士被消灭了

157
01:11:37,847 --> 01:11:41,556
我要建立一个新的Dalek种族
I shall build a new race of Daleks.

158
01:11:41,727 --> 01:11:44,639
他们会更致命

159
01:11:44,807 --> 01:11:49,085
而我 Davros 将成为他们的领袖

160
01:11:48,087 --> 01:11:50,078
- 我们去哪里 - 地球

161
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:52,035
这一次我们将胜出
This time we shall triumph!

162

真是最近听到的最好消息

- 为什么Dalek要救Davros - 为了找到一种病毒的解药
- Why did the Daleks rescue Davros? - To find a cure for a virus.

164
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:55,677
我的Dalek会再一次成为

165
01:11:55,847 --> 01:11:58,680
最高等的种族

166
01:11:56,847 --> 01:11:59,520
- 就是那收集器里的东西吗 - 没错
- Is that what's in those cylinders? - Yes.

167
01:11:59,687 --> 01:12:03,157

通过复制炸弹处理小队 Dalek就可以放心的让他们守卫着

后期：小鱼干 监制：于昊源

171
01:12:09,127 --> 01:12:13,598
- 设计的真巧妙 - 他们向来很狡猾
- Very neat. - They've lost none of their guile.

你去哪里
Where are you going?

175
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:21,800
- 刺杀Davros - 博士...
- To kill Davros. - Doctor...!

176
01:12:22,007 --> 01:12:25,602
我必须去 Davros创造了Dalek 不能让他救他们
Davros created the Daleks. He must not save them.

177
01:12:25,807 --> 01:12:27,798
但 谋杀
But, murder?

178
01:12:27,967 --> 01:12:33,280
曾经, 我中止了毁掉Dalek的计划 那是一个错误
Once before, I held back from destroying the Daleks. It was a mistake.

179
01:12:34,247 --> 01:12:37,045
- Davros必须死 - 我跟你一起去
- Davros must die. - I'll come with you.

180
01:12:37,207 --> 01:12:39,516
- 不 - 我知道他在哪儿
- No. - I know where he is.

181
01:12:39,687 --> 01:12:42,485
我也去 我要报仇
I'm coming, too. I'd like my revenge.

182
01:12:42,647 --> 01:12:47,243
好吧 你们在这儿等着 不过 如果Dalek开始攻击
All right. Wait as long as you can but, should the Daleks attack,

183
01:12:47,767 --> 01:12:50,201
- 立刻离开 - 你怎么办
- leave at once. - What about you?

184
01:12:59,567 --> 01:13:03,560
- 这是博士吗 - 犯人很重要
- Could this be the Doctor? - The prisoner is important.

185
01:13:03,847 --> 01:13:06,839
左边那个是Stien, 是我们的特别守卫
The one on the left, Stien, is a Special Guard.

186
01:13:07,007 --> 01:13:09,646
他不应该做守卫工作 除非意外
He wouldn't do escort duty otherwise.

187
01:13:09,847 --> 01:13:13,123
博士和他的Tardis
The Doctor and his Tardis.

188
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:15,000
非常好
Perfect!

189
01:18:42,447 --> 01:18:44,438
欢迎你, 博士
Welcome, Doctor.

190
01:18:46,087 --> 01:18:49,318
这一刻我等了好久
I have waited many years for this meeting.

191
01:18:49,527 --> 01:18:54,647
- 不好意思让你久等了 - 这是个迟来的惊喜
- I'm sorry to have detained you. - It was a pleasure deferred.

192
01:18:54,807 --> 01:19:00,643
现在 我要你十倍的偿还我曾经历过的精神痛苦
Now here, you will be paid tenfold for the mental agony I suffered.

193
01:19:00,887 --> 01:19:05,722
只能跟你说一件事, Davros 你这番话完全在我意料之中
I'll say one thing for you, Davros. Your conversation is totally predictable.

194
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:10,000
就像个精神错乱的孩子,你脑中只有复仇和破坏
Like a deranged child, you talk only of revenge and destruction.

195
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:12,920
这是到达终极力量的唯一路径
It is the only path to ultimate power.

196
01:19:13,087 --> 01:19:17,046
但是何时才是个头儿 还要给活着的人带来多少痛苦
But to what end? More suffering for those who survive?

197
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:20,159
只有那些反抗我的人才会痛苦
Only for those who resist my will.

198
01:19:22,927 --> 01:19:28,047
- 你想干什么 - 我真希望我不用这么做
- What are you doing? - I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.

199
01:19:28,247 --> 01:19:29,885
Stien 杀掉他
Stien! Kill him!

200
01:19:30,087 --> 01:19:32,885
我来这儿不是为了要当你的犯人, Davros
I'm not here as your prisoner, Davros.

201
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:36,447
- 而是你的处决者 - 听着...
- But your executioner. - Listen...

202
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:40,557
我计划完全重新设计Dalek
I had planned to completely redesign the Daleks.

203
01:19:40,727 --> 01:19:44,481
- Kiston会告诉你我说的都是实话 - 确实是这样
- Kiston will confirm I am telling the truth. - It is so.

204
01:19:44,967 --> 01:19:47,959
把它们做的十分残忍是我的错
My mistake was making them totally ruthless.

205
01:19:48,687 --> 01:19:53,761
它把他们的能力限制在杀戮 
It restricted their ability to cope with creatures who rely not only on logic,

206
01:19:53,927 --> 01:19:56,839
可他们是有本能和直觉的生物体
but instinct and intuition.

207
01:19:57,407 --> 01:20:00,479
这方面是我想要改正的
That is a factor that I wish to correct.

208
01:20:03,487 --> 01:20:07,446
那么同情心呢  你也为他们设定了那个吗 
And compassion? Are they to be programmed for that?

209
01:20:08,767 --> 01:20:13,602
他们会学习着去认识 从情感中提取这种力量
They will learn to recognise the strength that can be drawn from such an emotion.

210
01:20:13,807 --> 01:20:16,526
成为更高效的杀手
To become more efficient killers.

211
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:19,520
- 成为更有效的武力 - 为了毁灭
- To become a more positive force. - For destruction!

212
01:20:19,727 --> 01:20:21,718
宇宙即战场
The universe is at war.

213
01:20:21,887 --> 01:20:27,678
告诉我哪一个星球的历史不曾有暴行和野心
Name one planet whose history is not littered with atrocities and ambition.

214
01:20:27,847 --> 01:20:31,078
这是通用的行为准则
It is a universal way of life.

215
01:20:32,047 --> 01:20:34,481
我不同意
Which I do not accept.

216
01:20:34,687 --> 01:20:37,485
那你是在否认现实
Then you deny what is real.

217
01:20:38,127 --> 01:20:43,201
加入我们 在新的Dalek军队里你可以统治一切
Join me! You will have total power at the head of a new Dalek army.

218
01:20:43,367 --> 01:20:46,279
- 博士 - 外面 除掉他们
- Doctor. - Outside. Deal with them.

219
01:20:53,407 --> 01:20:57,719
老实说 我不知道要个军队有什么用
To be honest, I wouldn't know what to do with an army.

220
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:02,444
那是什么
What's that?

221
01:21:04,207 --> 01:21:07,358
博士预先设置了定时器
The Doctor preset the controls on the timer.

222
01:21:08,367 --> 01:21:11,643
- 我们正在飞往地球 - 他不打算回来了
- We're going to Earth. - He didn't intend to return.

223
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:17,957
- 怎么了 - 我们Dalek的时间走廊里
- What's happening? - We're going down the Dalek's Time Corridor,

224
01:21:19,367 --> 01:21:22,086
被拽回了仓库
being dragged back to the warehouse!

225
01:21:22,287 --> 01:21:24,755
你在犹豫, 博士
You hesitate, Doctor.

226
01:21:25,607 --> 01:21:27,598
如果我是你
If I were you,

227
01:21:27,767 --> 01:21:30,156
我会死掉
I would be dead.

228
01:21:30,327 --> 01:21:33,160
我没你有经验 Davros
I lack your practice, Davros.

229
01:21:33,367 --> 01:21:36,996
你太软弱了 象所有的时间领主一样
You are soft, like all Time Lords.

230
01:21:37,687 --> 01:21:40,155
你们宁愿袖手旁观
You prefer to stand and watch.

231
01:21:41,487 --> 01:21:43,717
行动需要勇气...
Action requires courage...

232
01:21:45,087 --> 01:21:46,884
..这是你所缺少的
..which you lack.

233
01:21:49,567 --> 01:21:53,765
别吵 立刻报告Lytton司令
Don't argue. Report to Commander Lytton at once.

234
01:21:53,927 --> 01:21:56,316
也许我可以说服你们
Perhaps I can convince you.

235
01:21:57,927 --> 01:21:59,918
你一定要这样吗
Did you have to?

236
01:22:01,687 --> 01:22:03,678
帮我把这些尸体藏起来
Help me hide the bodies.

237
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:10,080
- 你怎么了 - Dalek的控制占上风
- Now what? - The Dalek conditioning is taking hold.

238
01:22:10,287 --> 01:22:13,085
你应该待在Tardis里面
You should have stayed in the Tardis.

239
01:22:13,247 --> 01:22:14,885
缴枪不杀
Drop your guns!

240
01:22:15,047 --> 01:22:19,359
- 没事 是我们的部队 - 是Dalek的部队
- It's all right. They're our troopers. - They're Dalek troopers!

241
01:22:34,047 --> 01:22:36,925
- 待在这儿 - 你需要医疗救治
- Stay there. - You need medical attention.

242
01:22:37,127 --> 01:22:41,598
我控制不了自己的大脑 我很危险 我必须要离开这儿
I can't control my mind. I'm not safe. I must get away from here.

243
01:22:41,807 --> 01:22:44,799
- 等等 我能帮你 - 不要跟着我 我会害死你的
- Wait! I can help you. - Don't follow me.I may cause your death.

244
01:22:49,567 --> 01:22:51,558
蠢货 
Imbecile.

245
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:55,646
你的部队失败了 Davros还活着
Your troopers have failed. Davros still lives.

246
01:22:55,807 --> 01:22:58,879
那就炸掉空间站
Then shoot the space station down.

247
01:22:59,047 --> 01:23:01,436
我要看着他死掉
I must see him dead.

248
01:23:01,607 --> 01:23:06,761
我派了几个Dalek 去完成你失败的任务
I have dispatched Daleks to complete the task you failed.

249
01:23:07,287 --> 01:23:09,881
你必须要做出补偿
You must redeem yourself.

250
01:23:09,327 --> 01:23:12,637
- 真的 一个就够了 - 我们需要另一个
- Surely one's enough! - We need another.

251
01:23:10,047 --> 01:23:13,835
你必须毁掉Davros的Dalek
You must destroy the Daleks of Davros.

252
01:23:14,007 --> 01:23:17,920
- 他们去哪儿了 - 跟着他们去地球 
- Where are they? - You must follow them to Earth.

253
01:23:17,727 --> 01:23:21,686
好啦... 我们回到Tardis里
Right... Let's get back to the Tardis.

254
01:23:18,087 --> 01:23:21,363
务必杀掉他们
You must exterminate them.

255
01:23:21,967 --> 01:23:26,643
这一点儿都不好 我要更积极些
This isn't any good. I've got to be more positive.

256
01:23:29,887 --> 01:23:31,479
积极点
Positive.

257
01:23:32,647 --> 01:23:36,640
自毁... 我一定要找到自毁系统控制室
Self-destruct... I must find the self-destruct chamber.

258
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:49,806
- 这太傻了 - 别说话 士兵们可能会听到
- This is lunacy. - Quiet! The soldiers might hear you.

259
01:23:55,047 --> 01:23:58,119
有什么用呢 我们不能再回到Dalek飞船上
What's the point? We can't go back to the Dalek ship.

260
01:23:58,287 --> 01:24:03,077
博士可能会回来 也许有些别的机会 我也不知道
The Doctor may get back. Some other opportunity may arise. I don't know!

261
01:24:06,247 --> 01:24:08,238
完全疯了
Absolute madness.

262
01:24:09,287 --> 01:24:14,281
收集器里的病毒是唯一 能克制Dalek的东西
The virus in those cylinders is the only effective thing to fight the Daleks with.

263
01:56:33,147 --> 01:56:36,059
搞定 我要休息下了
Done it! I must rest.

264
01:56:38,067 --> 01:56:39,944
好累
I'm tired.
