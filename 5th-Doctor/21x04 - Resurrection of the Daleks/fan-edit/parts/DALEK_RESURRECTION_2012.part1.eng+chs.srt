180
02:13:23,947 --> 02:13:27,144
有意思  你看起来并不相信我们 是吗

02:13:27,307 --> 02:13:30,105
是嘛  我从来没听过这样的事

203
02:33:22,127 --> 02:33:25,483
难道那不是责任感的体现吗

住口 这是保持理智的唯一方法

我在这儿够久了 久到都知道了这儿的士气低落到多吓人
I've been here long enough to learn that the morale here is appalling.

208
02:33:37,527 --> 02:33:40,883
- 如果头头儿都不关心 我何苦管它呢  - 到底为什么

Or I could be here for another two years!

213
02:33:51,927 --> 02:33:53,804
开火 
Fire!

214
02:33:52,687 --> 02:33:56,839
如果主管们知道了这儿的士气 队长就等着下岗吧
If control were aware of the morale, the captain wouldn't be in command.

215
02:33:57,007 --> 02:34:02,240
以前也不是没试过 通常是像你这样没经验的新人
It's been tried before, usually by inexperienced new boys like you.

216
02:34:02,887 --> 02:34:07,403
博士 我们正跟时间走廊相平行呢
Doctor, we're travelling parallel to the Time Corridor.

217
02:34:04,047 --> 02:34:06,322
现在 就是现在 
Now. Now!

02:34:07,567 --> 02:34:12,357
-  我们正在往哪儿去  -  看起来像是20世纪的地球

- How long before they try again? - Soon.

220
