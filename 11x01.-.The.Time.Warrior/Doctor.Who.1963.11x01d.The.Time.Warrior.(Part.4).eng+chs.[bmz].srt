- You wish for my answer, Doctor?
- I do.
- 你期待我的答案吗，博士？ - 是的

8
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:37,678
Then here it is.
这就是了

9
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:42,882
SARAH: No!
不要！

10
00:00:45,485 --> 00:00:49,558
The female, too. It seems I am doubly fortunate.
那个女性也来了，看来我是双重幸运了

11
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:53,758
- Get up. Get back to work!
- DOCTOR: Linx.
- 起来，回去工作！ - Linx

12
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:58,840
Can't you see that your prisoners
are physically exhausted?
你看不到你的囚徒身体都已经耗尽了吗？

13
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:01,241
They've had no sleep and nothing to eat for days.
他们好多天没睡眠没吃东西了

14
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:03,793
- They can still work!
- Not for much longer.
- 他们还能工作的！ - 不会太长了

15
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:06,240
LINX: I owe these primitives nothing.
我也不欠这些原始人什么

16
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:10,284
My only concern is to rejoin our glorious struggle for freedom.
我唯一关心的是重新加入我们争取自由的光荣斗争

17
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:12,754
DOCTOR: That's such an old tune.
那真是老调重弹

18
00:01:12,845 --> 00:01:15,234
Don't you know there's no such thing
as the super race?
难道你不知道并没有超级种族这样的事吗？

19
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,840
Your Time Lord philosophy is egalitarian twaddle.
你们时间领主的哲学无非是平等主义那些废话

20
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:20,643
It is a weakness.
这是个弱点

21
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:23,478
Every species has its own weakness, Linx.
每个物种都有自己的弱点，Linx

22
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:28,603
For instance, you can only be stunned
by a blow on the probic vent,
举个例子, 只有对准你的通气口猛击，你才会被击晕

23
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,678
that small hole at the back of your neck.
那个通气口在你脖子后面的小洞那里

24
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:33,596
LINX: In our case, Doctor, it is a strength,
在我们看来，博士，这是种力量

25
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:36,438
because it means we must always face our enemies.
因为它意味着我们必须永远正面面对我们的敌人

26
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:39,835
Now, to return to the question of your demise.
现在，回到你的结局这个问题

27
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:41,483
I think it would be better
我认为最好

28
00:01:41,565 --> 00:01:46,241
if you witnessed first the destruction
of your female companion.
你先目睹一下你女性同伴的灭亡

29
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,443
Well done, Rubeish.
干得好，Rubeish

30
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:57,155
- Doctor, are you all right?
- Yes.
- 博士，你还好吗？  - 是的

31
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:00,679
Yes. The blast was too brief.
还好，刚才的冲击波还太弱

32
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:02,517
But I wouldn't have been in a few moments.
但我也得缓一下才行

33
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:05,483
- Thank you very much, Sarah.
- Oh, pleasure.
- 非常谢谢你，莎拉  - 哦，乐意帮忙

34
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:10,041
Hadn't I better be getting on with the rest of your plan?
我是不是应该继续你的计划？

35
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:13,401
- Yes. All right, but be careful.
- You, too, Doctor.
- 是的，继续吧，不过要小心  - 你也是，博士

36
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:18,756
Right. Well, if we can secure our friend here,
好。嗯，如果我们能限制住这位朋友

37
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:22,723
we can get on with the job of restoring
his wretched victims.
我们还可以继续恢复这些可怜的受害者

38
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:24,557
Will this help?
这能帮上忙吗？

39
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,113
Rubeish, you're invaluable, my dear chap.
Rubeish, 你真是个无价之宝，亲爱的伙计

40
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:31,597
- Bloodaxe.
- Captain. 
- Bloodaxe  - 头儿？

41
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,277
Fetch me Linx.
把 Linx 给我叫来

42
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:36,323
Fetch me that scabby-faced stoat from his burrow.
把那个面无表情的家伙从他的洞穴里弄出来

43
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:38,043
At once, Captain.
马上，头儿

44
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:50,361
Well, that should hold him for a while,
even on this planet.
好了，这样应该能困住他一阵了，即使是在这个星球上？

45
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:51,594
Why this planet?
为什么说“这个星球”？

46
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:54,802
Well, in his own environment, he weighs several tons.
哦，在他们的环境下，他重达好几吨

47
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:58,240
Fortunately, his muscles have been designed
for load bearing rather than leverage
幸运的是, 他的肌肉是为承重而设计的, 而不是力量(?)

48
00:02:58,325 --> 00:02:59,714
Fascinating.
有意思

49
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,273
I'd always assumed that creatures
from a high-density planet
我一直以为来自高密度星球的生物

50
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:04,833
would have developed a pressure-balanced physiology.
会演化出压力平衡的生理机能

51
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:06,756
For example, if you take certain types of seaweed...
比如，如果你找几样海藻...

52
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:09,962
BLOODAXE: Linx! Linx!

53
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:17,156
-Linx?

00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:24,363
Well, come soon or we come and fetch you.

57
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:30,680
Who is Irongron? Is he a nice chap?
Irongron 是谁？ 是个好人吗？

58
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:33,518
Well, I wouldn't recommend him
for the Royal Society.
反正，我不会推荐他加入皇家学会

59
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:35,994
All right, Rubeish, you know how
to bring these people round?
好了，Rubeish，你知道怎么把这些人唤醒过来了吧

60
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:37,757
- Yes. A simple, repetitive optical...
- Yes, quite so.
- 是，很简单，一直进行光学的...
- 对，就这样

61
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:39,881
- I'll leave you to get on with it.
- What do you propose to do?
- 我就把这个事情留给你了
- 你打算干什么去？

62
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:42,240
I was going to preset this osmic projector.
我原本正要去调整好锇投射器

63
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:44,634
Send these people back to their own time.
好把这些人送回原来的时代

64
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,115
But now I have to find a way of stalling Irongron.
但现在我必须得找到一个方法拖住 Irongron

65
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:55,562
The robot! Yes, of course.
那个机器人！对了，当然

66
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:59,038
That ought to give him something to think about.
那应该可以让他费点脑筋了

67
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:27,358
Thief!
小偷！

68
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:31,284
You common scullion, stand aside!
你，粗鄙的下人，站一边去！

69
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:35,355
How dare you obstruct me?
I shall have you flogged.
胆敢妨碍我？我会让人抽你的

70
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:38,005
Oh, so, a lady, are you?
哦，这么说，你是位小姐？

71
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:40,804
- A lady dressed as a serving wench? 
- I'm hungry.
- 一位小姐穿得跟个侍女一样？
- 我饿了

72
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:44,673
Please let me go. I've tasted neither
bread nor meat for nearly a month.
请放我走吧，我已经快一个月没有吃过面包或白面了

73
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:50,724
No, nor done no work for longer
by the look of you.
看样子你也是很久没有劳动了

74
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:53,319
All right, my girl, I'll give you bread and cheese,

from the one who made me, my master, Commander Linx.

还真是那个机器人，Bloodaxe，虽然形状上有点不同

80
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:18,361
And I remember, Linx promised
to make me a second iron man,
而且我记得，Linx 承诺过给我再造一个机器人的

81
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,640
one that would obey my voice.

83
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:26,080
Why has he not himself obeyed my summons?
为什么他自己不服从我的召见？

84
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:31,285
My master toils in his workshop to make you more fighting robots.
我的主人正在他的工作间里忙碌，给你造更多的战斗机器人

85
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:35,236

89
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:52,281
Then fight me.
那来跟我打

90
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:56,153
I was programmed to fight for you,
not against you.
我被设计成为你战斗，而不是与你战斗

91
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:59,999
- Cease thy gabble and fight.
- You will damage my circuits.
- 少废话，开打！  - 你会毁坏我的电路的

Fight, iron man,
战斗吧，铁人

93
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:05,718
or you'll return to Linx in as
many pieces as did your brother.
要不就把你砍碎了送回 Linx 那里去，跟你兄弟一样

94
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:36,960
Hold.
停下

95
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:42,317
It's truly a marvel, Captain.
Never have I seen a finer swordsman.
这真很神啊，头儿，从来没见过比这更好的剑士

96
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:46,637
Ah, 'tis great sport this, Bloodaxe.
Draw your sword and join me.
啊，这是很好的锻炼啊，Bloodaxe，拿出剑来加入我吧

97
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:49,797
We'll try this creature's strength to the utmost.

98
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:52,036
Get on!

Oh, fighting again in the great hall, I'll warrant.
噢，又在大厅里打斗了，我敢肯定

102

106
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:21,636
We must slow this iron man's speed a little.
我们得让这个铁人的速度慢一点

107
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:24,637
Stick me some crossbow bolts in the creature.
用十字弓给这个家伙钉几下

108
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:28,320
We'll see if it fights as well with
a crossbow bolt or two in its gizzard.
我们倒要看看，肚子上中了一两箭之后它是不是还这么能打

109
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:29,804
And if that fails,
如果不行，

110

113
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:38,119
I mean, sitting ducks and all that.

This iron man talks like some Norman ninny.
这个铁人说话有点像某个诺曼底傻瓜

Because if I did, it might give you a seizure.
如果我那样做的话，你可能会被吓晕

The sword is too quick and clean a death for you.
这种死法对你来说太快太干净了

122

Well, since you are a wizard,
这样，既然你是一位巫师

123
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:29,078
then by wizardry shall you die.
你应该死于巫术之下

124
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:34,042
Not so much of that oatmeal, girl.
It's only pikemen we're feeding, not horses.

如果你烧糊了 Irongron 的食物，他会把你的肝都挖出来的

- 你问题还真多，姑娘  - 门口的守卫不吃饭吗？

130
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:52,524
What? Meat for those common creatures?
I should say not.
什么？给那些杂役做饭？要我说不用

131
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:54,596
They'll have oatmeal, the same as the rest of us,
他们吃燕麦粥，跟我们一样

Why should women always
have to cook and carry for them?
为什么应该是女人给他们做饭、整理东西？

136
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:06,364
- What else should we do?
- Stand up for ourselves.

告诉男人你已经厌倦了像个奴隶一样为他们干活

138
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:11,474
