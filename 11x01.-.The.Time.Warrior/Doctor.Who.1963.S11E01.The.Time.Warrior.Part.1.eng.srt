00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,639
This sheep has been dead a year.

4
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,639
-Are they trying to poison me?
-It is salted.

5
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:51,683
Salted? It stinks!

6
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:56,361
Wine! Must I perish of thirst?
Bring me wine!

7
00:00:56,725 --> 00:01:00,559
'Tis the dregs of the barrel, Captain.
'Tis the last there is.

Sour wine! Stinking meat!

10
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:13,602
Sour wine! Is this how I'm served?

11
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:17,678
Our supplies are low, Captain.
It's sometime since we went a-foraging.

12
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:21,440
Meanwhile our fine neighbours
feast their bellies full on fresh meat

13
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:23,834
and swill down flagons of fine wine.

14
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:27,315
Well, Sir Edward's storehouses
and cellars are well-stocked.

15
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:31,193
Then perhaps we should relieve him
of some of his abundance, eh, my friend?

16
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:34,197
He's a good neighbour.
He'll not miss a little of his plenty.

17
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:35,874
Look!

Stars are falling!

20
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:47,161
I see only one star.

21
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:51,917
It has fallen in the forest!

22
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:54,395
Come on, get up. Get up! Get up!

23
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:55,962
It is an omen.

24
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:58,273
-An evil sign!
-It is mine.

25
00:01:58,363 --> 00:02:00,513
Irongron's star. I will have it!

26
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:03,595
-Hurry. Fetch the horses.
-Hurry? Hurry where?

27
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:07,232
To find the star before some knave
robs me of it. It landed close by.

28
00:02:07,323 --> 00:02:11,396
But the forest is still in darkness.
Who knows what demons may set upon us?

29
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:14,998
Why, you chicken-hearted knaves,
every man of you!

30
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:18,758
It's but an hour till dawn!
Let's wait till then.

31
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:22,677
To wait and see what faces us.
We'll follow you then, Captain.

32
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:30,079
Let all be made ready. I ride at dawn.

33
00:02:31,203 --> 00:02:33,558
-Alone if need be.
-We're with you, Captain.

34
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:35,679
Then bring me some wine.

35
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:38,436
We'll drink a toast to Irongron's star.

36
00:03:13,803 --> 00:03:16,636
A star. A fallen star.

37
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:19,191
Careful, Captain,
looks like the devil's work to me.

38
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,798
A warrior? A warrior from the stars!
Have you come to challenge me?

(HIGH-PITCHED WHIRRING)

-What creature is this?
-'Tis a devil from hell.

43

Fear not. I shall not harm you.

44
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:54,599
It speaks. Who are you?
Where do you come from?

45
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:56,911
I am a Sontaran officer.

46
00:03:57,561 --> 00:03:59,756
My name is Linx.

47
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:03,277
I say he's a Saracen.
I have heard tales of his Eastern magic.

48
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:19,115
By virtue of my authority
as an officer of the Army Space Corps,

49
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:22,955
I hereby claim this planet,
its moons and satellites

50
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,033
for the greater glory
of the Sontaran Empire.

51
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:32,911
Help you?
Why should I help you, star warrior?

52
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:37,071
Why should I not kill you and take
your ship and its treasure for myself?

53
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:39,311
LINX: The ship is in need of repair.

54
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:42,996
Even if it were not, you would destroy
yourself should you tamper with it.

55
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:46,437
Then why should I
not just slay you for sport?

56
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:50,070
Can you overcome all of us
with your magic?

57
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:02,670
LINX: You are a soldier, are you not?
A warrior?

58
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,594
I took this castle by force of arms.

59
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,434
Those that were here before me, I slew.

60
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:11,160
All the countryside around here
pays my tribute.

61
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:13,197
Yet no doubt you have enemies?

62
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:15,112
Other warriors who envy
your good fortune?

63
00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:17,795
Aye, but they cannot harm me.

64
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:20,272
The king has levied tribute.

65
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:24,115
-All their troops are at the wars.
-And when they return?

66
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:25,953
Then we shall fight.

67
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:28,951
I can give you weapons,

68
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,590
weapons that can make you masters
so that none dare stand against you.

69
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:35,832
-You shall take what castles you will.
-Magic weapons?

70
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:38,913
Like that
that smote the sword from my hand?

71
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:41,754
Other weapons fitter for your purpose.

72
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,560
Weapons that can strike a man dead
from far away.

73
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:48,316
-You can be supreme warrior.
-I can be king.

74
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:53,590
But what do you ask in return,
apart from your life?

75
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:55,672
Shelter.

76
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:59,071
A place to conceal my ship
and help with its repair.

77
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:03,755
-You have men that can work in metal?
-An armourer to sharpen weapons,

78
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:06,309
a smith with a forge
if these will serve your need.

79
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,710
I need more, much more.

80
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,440
There is damage to the drive mechanism
of my ship.

81
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:14,911
I need alloy, skilled technicians,
complex circuitry.

82
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:18,437
Oh, we have none of these things
of which you speak.

83
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:22,194
Then I must take them
from those who have.

84
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:33,756
In here, Brigadier?

85
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:36,753
Yes, I'm afraid so, Doctor.
Not exactly the Ritz, I know,

86
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:39,036
but it's no joke
providing emergency accommodation

87
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:40,474
for all these scientists.

88
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:42,791
All right, Brigadier, you've had
your little bit of mystification.

89
00:06:42,881 --> 00:06:44,314
Now I know where I'm supposed to stay,

90
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:46,392
perhaps you wouldn't mind
telling me why?

91
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:49,200
This place is one of the most
top secret security establishments

92
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:50,839
in the whole country.

93
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:52,274
Most of their work is so secret

94
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:53,714
they don't know what
they're doing themselves.

95
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:54,836
And?

96
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:56,991
It's also one of the best-guarded places
in the country.

97
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,799
Security details, alarm systems...

98
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,712
I rather gathered that when we arrived.

99
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:03,190
For a moment I thought
they weren't going to let you in.

100
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:06,916
Yes, exactly. The place is almost
too security conscious.

101
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:10,440
That's what makes it
all the more puzzling.

102
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,910
Makes what all the more puzzling?

103
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:16,355
Come on, Brigadier, you can tell me.

104
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,277
-People vanishing.
-People?

105
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,872
Well, they've lost
half a dozen leading scientists

106
00:07:21,961 --> 00:07:24,680
and several million pounds' worth
of ultra-secret equipment.

107
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:27,275
What are they working on here anyway?

108
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:31,798
Space hardware. New alloys,
guidance systems, methods of propulsion.

109
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:34,873
-And what action have you taken so far?
-Well, I had rather a bright idea.

110
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:37,236
It's pretty hard to keep an eye on
all these scientist chaps at home,

111
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:40,518
so I had these cubicles put up
on several floors.

112
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,870
Confined the whole lot to barracks,
all my eggs in one basket so to speak.

113
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:48,476
That's fine,
so long as no one steals the basket.

114
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:08,114
(BANGING ON DOOR)

115
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:11,113
Linx! My Lord Linx!

116
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:13,433
Will you open the door?

117
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:17,673
LINX: None may enter here.
Such was my agreement with your captain.

118
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:20,355
Yay, it is my captain who sent me.

119
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:22,636
He would have words with you, Lord Linx.

120
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:26,157
Then tell him I'm occupied.
Now leave me to my work.

121
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,754
(BANGS ON DOOR)

122
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,959
Insolent primitives.
Did I not need their aid...

123
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,995
-Where is the star warrior?
-He would not come.

124
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:46,915
-He says he's occupied.
-Oh, the insolent barbarian.

125
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:49,196
Did I not need his help, I'd...

126
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:52,239
See, Bloodaxe.
The first of the new weapons.

127
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:53,910
Watch!

128
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,317
Oh! Claps the ears!

129
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:58,915
I'll soon master the aim.

130
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:03,479
Rubeish.

131
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:05,711
-I beg your pardon?
-Joseph Rubeish.

132
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:07,792
Oh, I see. I'm so sorry.
Hello. How do you do?

133
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,678
It's disgraceful, of course.
Utterly disgraceful.

134
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:11,592
-Oh? What is?
-Well, shutting us up.

135
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:16,232
Like a lot of kids kept in after school.
And that brigadier chap, military idiot.

136
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:18,596
Yes, I know how you feel.
Still, he means well, you know.

137
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:20,478
Haven't seen my wife and family
for three days.

138
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,710
I'm sorry to hear that.

139
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:24,952
Ah, well, just shows
there's always a silver lining.

140
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:29,159
-And your name?
-Uh, Smith, Dr John Smith.

141
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:32,119
-Seems to be a lot of them about today.
-I'm sorry?

142
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:34,954
I was talking to a young woman
just now, also Smith.

143
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,157
-Well, there she is. Miss Smith?
-Yes, Professor?

144
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:38,356
Come and meet your namesake.

145
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:41,638
-Miss Lavinia Smith, Doctor, uh...
-Dr John Smith.

146
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:43,919
-How do you do, Miss Smith?
-Hello.

147
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,959
Doctor, I'm intrigued. What's that for?

148
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,635
That? Oh, that,
that contains my equipment, Professor.

149
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:51,313
That's original.

150
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:54,998
-You're the virologist, Miss Smith?
-Yes.

151
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:56,958
Who told you?

152
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,680
I read your paper on
the teleological response of the virus,

153
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:02,229
-a most impressive piece of work.
-Thank you.

154
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:03,470
Particularly when I realised

155
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,756
you must have written it
when you were five years old.

156
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:10,039
Ah, uh... Yes, that is rather difficult
to explain, isn't it?

157
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:13,955
-You're going to try, aren't you?
-Well, um...

158
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:17,354
My Aunt Lavinia is in America
on a lecture tour, you see.

159
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:20,194
-Mmm-hmm.
-She had an invitation to visit here.

160
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:22,511
-I took her place.
-Why?

161
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,557
I thought all this
might give me a good story.

162
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:27,155
I'm a journalist. Sarah Jane Smith.

163
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:30,149
You realise this is
a very dangerous place to be in?

164
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:32,232
Well, I can't help that.
I'm stuck here now.

165
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:35,791
Anyway, we've got all these soldiers
looking after us.

166
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:38,520
Are you going to give me away, Doctor?

167
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,717
-I don't think so.
-Why not?

168
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:46,632
Well, you can make yourself useful.

169
00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:48,871
We need somebody around here
to make the coffee.

170
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:51,919
If you think I'm going to spend my time
making cups of coffee for you...

171
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,229
Professor!

172
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:56,199
Would you kindly desist?
This is not a blackboard, you know.

173
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,317
Oh, I do beg your pardon, Doctor.
I was just trying to prove...

174
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:01,234
What are you going to do in there?

175
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:04,233
Make myself a cup of coffee.
Good day to you.

176
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,311
But for how long, Edward?

177
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,356
How long are we
to tolerate this upstart,

178
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,874
this insolent usurper, as our neighbour?

179
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,238
He robs, he pillages, he murders.
He flouts your authority every day,

180
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,436
your authority
which comes from the King.

181
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,988
Unfortunately, my dear,
the king who gave me my authority

182
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,470
has taken away my troops to fight
in his interminable wars.

183
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,189
Irongron's band is small
and we still have Hal the archer,

184
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,077
and one or two men-at-arms.

185
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,957
I've sent letters to all our neighbours.

186
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,235
Each, like myself,
has but a mere handful of men,

187
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,710
yet if all these handfuls be combined,

188
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,429
they might yet make a force
that will crush this Irongron.

189
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,231
If you will excuse me, my dear,
I must give orders for dinner.

190
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,751
We caught this little rabbit
in the forest, sire.

191
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,350
Sir Edward's squire.

192
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,673
-Are you loyal to your lord, boy?
-I am.

193
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,915
-We shall see.
-He carried this.

194
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,319
-He tried to eat it when we caught him.
-Are Sir Edward's men so ill-fed?

195
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,791
Bah! I make nothing
of their Norman scribbles.

196
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,758
-What's it say?
-I cannot read, Captain.

197
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,149
What's the message say, boy?

198
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,232
So your Sir Edward
is going to attack me, eh?

199
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,831
Well, speak.

200
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,716
I know nothing.

201
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,993
Take him below.
We'll loosen his tongue presently.

202
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,519
-Edward.
-What is it? Is Eric back?

203
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,956
-You haven't eaten all day.
-Why does he not return?

204
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,918
I could have ridden to my Lord
of Salisbury's castle three times over.

205
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,151
-It's not good for you to worry so much.
-How can I not worry?

206
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,515
Think that tomorrow will be brighter.

207
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,990
Edward, I've heard that Irongron walks
his battlements every morning.

208
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,640
Oh, it pleases him to be high.
He's like a cockerel.

209
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,315
But does he climb so high
that an arrow cannot reach him?

210
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,793
LINX: Irongron.

211

(IRONGRON CHUCKLING)

212
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,749
That strange armour you wear
suits you, Linx.

213
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,118
-It is Sontaran space armour.
-But why must we never see your face?

214
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,078
This helmet conceals the fact
that I am not of your kind, Irongron.

215
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,674
You might not find
my true appearance pleasing.

216
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,954
(CHUCKLING) By my sword, Linx, I'll wage
you're the fairest beauty in the castle.

217
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,918
Why did you summon me?
You know my work is pressing.

218
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,516
I have a prisoner in the dungeon,
a surly fellow who will not speak.

219
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,909
-And you wish him to?
-Yes.

220
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,878
Then give him to me.
I will make him speak.

221
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,313
Tell Bloodaxe to bring up the prisoner.

222
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,952
Well, Linx, you cunning old devil,

223
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,191
what fresh tricks
can you show Irongron, eh?

224
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,919
What is the nature of the information
you seek?

225
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,639
He's a messenger of those
who plot a war against me.

226
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,438
A war? That is excellent.

227
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,592
-Oh, so you like war, eh?
-Who does not?

228
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,513
My race has been at war for millennia.

229
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,318
There is not a galaxy in the universe

230
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,312
which our space fleets
have not subjugated.

231
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,553
But you do not understand me.

232
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,596
I am stranded on this primitive planet

233
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,558
when I should be
leading my squadron to glory.

234
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,235
-I am an expert at war, Irongron.
-I know.

235
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,438
What about those weapons
you promised me?

236
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,755
Keep your side of the bargain,
I shall keep mine.

237
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,910
You shall have your weapons.

238
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,353
(GROWLING)

239
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,070
We make good allies, Linx.
Each has much that the other wants.

240
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,913
-Miss Smith...
-No, no, I'm the Doctor.

241
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,434
You really must keep your glasses
on the end of your nose, Professor.

242
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,114
No, no. Listen, she's not Miss Smith.

243
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,910
-She isn't?
-No. Who is she?

244
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,115
I don't think I quite understand
what you're talking about, Professor.

245
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,033
Just now I was in the common room
with Sir Maxwell Dingle.

246
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,838
I happened to mention
I was on the same landing

247
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,592
with Lavinia Smith, the virologist.

248
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,830
-And do you know what he says?
-Yes. He said that she's in America.

249
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,319
He said she's in... How could you know?

250
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,675
Please be careful!
This is very delicate equipment.

251
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,228
What if she's a spy? What do we do?

252
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,516
-Shoot her?
-Ha! There's something odd about her.

253
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,397
She even tried to tell me
you were a spy.

254
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,835
Am I on the right floor?

255
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,514
-Good night.
-Goodnight, Professor.

256
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,515
-What's that?
-That's my alarm clock.

257
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,876
Oh, Doctor, kindly don't be so
patronising. Now, what is it really?

258
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,157
It's a rhondium sensor.
It detects delta particles.

259
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,800
At a preset spectrum density of 1 5 ams,

260
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,110
it oscillates
this little cylinder there,

261
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,875
which promotes a vacuum in there,
which wakes me up. Clear?

262
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,197
Why do you want to be woken up
when it detects delta particles?

263
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,271
Because I am very fond
of delta particles.

264
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,194
-Why do you ask so many questions?
-Because I'm a journalist.

265
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,514
-Are you going to sleep there?
-If you'll allow me to do so.

266
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,111
Good night, Miss Smith.

267
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,999
Psst.

268
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,991
Shouldn't we tell the Brigadier?

269
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,071
-Tell the Brigadier what?
-About her.

270
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,912
I think we can decide
what to do about Miss Smith

271
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,117
in the morning, Professor,
if we're all still here.

272
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,272
He has a stout heart, this one, sire.
He speaks not a word.

273
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,397
Good. A fair measure for you, Linx.

Well, come on, Linx, have at him!

-Ask what you wish.
-Eh?

But you've done nothing.

278
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,432
This is a key.
I have unlocked your prisoner's mind.

279
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,157
Question him.

280
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:17,869
How many men guard Sir Edward's castle?

281
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,110
There are but 1 0,
old men for the most part.

282
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,952
And he plans to attack me
with 1 0 old men?

283
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,428
He sends messages
to raise a force against you.

284
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,872
If he succeed, then he will attack.

-No.

307
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:58,909
(BEEPING)

308
00:18:59,677 --> 00:19:01,793
(BEEPING ACCELERATING)

309
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,033
-What were they shooting at?
-Shadows.

310
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:24,756
Oh, come on, Doctor,
stop treating me like a child.

311
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:27,590
I can't understand
why the definition was so low.

312
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:31,716
Unless he's operating with a very weak
power source at maximum range.

313
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:34,357
-Yes, of course.
-BRIGADIER: Doctor?

314
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:38,270
-Doctor?
-Hello!

315
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:42,236
Look, Doctor, we've had a raid.
Is everyone present on this landing?

316
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:44,035
No. Professor Rubeish is missing.

317
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:46,506
Oh, my giddy aunt!
The Minister will go spare.

318
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:47,950
Did you see anything, Doctor?

319
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:49,709
-Yes.
-What?

320
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:52,516
Well, I thought I saw a man in armour.

321
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:54,076
-A man in armour?
-Mmm-hmm.

322
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:56,387
You mean old-fashioned armour?
You mean a ghost?

323
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:58,627
Oh, I very much doubt it.

324
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:01,515
-Sorry I can't stop, Brigadier.
-Why? Where are you going?

325
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:03,792
Well, I've got to get on the trail
while it's still warm.

326
00:20:03,877 --> 00:20:05,708
What trail? The chap's just vanished.

327
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:08,470
No, he hasn't. I just got a fix on him.

328
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:10,275
There's something very odd indeed
going on.

329
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:13,394
Yes. Well, if I may say so, Doctor,
that is not exactly news to me.

330
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:16,230
Someone's operating
a matter transmitter.

331
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:19,468
And the really odd thing is
there's a time transference, too.

332
00:20:19,557 --> 00:20:23,835
It's being worked from several centuries
ago, past and present mixed up.

333
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:27,626
-DOCTOR: Very interesting that.
-Professor Rubeish, are you in there?

334
00:20:28,117 --> 00:20:30,756
I can't stay here chatting, old boy.
Got to get after Rubeish.

335
00:20:30,837 --> 00:20:32,589
Doctor, I forbid you to go off
in that contraption.

336
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:34,793
There's no telling
where you'll finish up.

337
00:20:34,877 --> 00:20:36,788
Remember what happened to you
on Metebelis III.

338
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:40,267
-Well, I got there, didn't I?
-Yes, eventually, after several detours.

339
00:20:40,357 --> 00:20:45,306
Brigadier, a straight line may be the
shortest distance between two points,

340
00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:48,036
but it is by no means
the most interesting.

341
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:49,835
Goodbye, old chap.

342
00:20:52,397 --> 00:20:53,625
But, Doc...

343
00:20:53,717 --> 00:20:55,787
(WHOOSHING)

344
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:10,195
(WHOOSHING)

345
00:21:19,116 --> 00:21:22,347
Well done, old girl.
Absolutely on target.

346
00:21:23,276 --> 00:21:24,550
For once.

347
00:21:37,316 --> 00:21:39,591
It's still only a police box.

348
00:21:41,956 --> 00:21:43,753
I must find a telephone.

349
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:49,915
Sir Edward only has a puny force.
He stands within his walls.

350
00:21:49,996 --> 00:21:53,545
-If we can only breach them, Bloodaxe.
-We could cut Sir Edward's soldiers down

351
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:57,390
in less time than our rogues spend
with their breakfasts.

352
00:21:57,476 --> 00:22:00,912
It's those accursed walls,
walls like these.

353
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:03,305
But with Linx's new weapons...

354
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:09,275
Excuse me, could you tell me
where the nearest telephone...

355
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,555
He flees through the forest. Take him!

356
00:22:14,556 --> 00:22:17,309
After him, you dogs! Through the forest!

357
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:25,591
Oh, it must be some sort of pageant.
I say...

358
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:29,711
Hey, you there.
Hey, what are you doing? Get off!

359
00:22:30,556 --> 00:22:33,992
-Let go of me! Hey!
-How the blazes did she get here?

360
00:22:36,476 --> 00:22:37,989
SARAH: Stop it!

361
00:22:38,436 --> 00:22:42,190
Look, if this is a rag day joke,
it's not funny!

362
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:45,507
-Come on!
-Let me go! I won't tell you...

363
00:22:56,196 --> 00:22:57,595
