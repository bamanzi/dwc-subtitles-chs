Thank you very much, Miss Smith. A most timely rescue.

This isn't a rescue, Doctor, it's a capture.

Let's get him out of here.

That fellow has the gall of a camel and the cunning of a fox!

The Doctor?
博士？

41
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:38,079
Bother me now, little toad, and you will feel an axe in your skull!
这会儿烦我的话，小蟾蜍，小心我的斧头砍掉你的脑袋！

42
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:42,962
Master, I heard someone call ''Doctor''
while we were at that fellow's heels.
主人，我们在追那个家伙的时候，听到谁喊了一声“博士”

Is this Doctor a long shank rascal with a mighty nose?

That is how he would appear in human eyes.
在人类眼中他应该是那样

45
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,877
Then he is no longer here.
那他现在已经不在这里了

Sir Edward sent raiders to my castle,
captured him.

- You've been getting around, Sarah.

Are you on visiting terms with all the local nobility?

Doctor, let's get a few things straight, shall we?
博士，我们有话直说，好吗

Oh, dear. I'm afraid you're going to be awfully confused

if you ask me to explain about the Tardis.

- Yes, my police box.

You were a stowaway, I imagine.

00:04:17,687 --> 00:04:19,757
Yes, but we'll come to that later.
是的，但这个问题我们稍后再说

57
00:04:19,847 --> 00:04:24,363
- Now then, why are you helping Irongron?
- My dear girl, I'm not helping him.
- 现在说说，你为什么要帮 Irongron？ - 亲爱的姑娘，我没在帮 Irongron

58
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:27,555
Linx is. I'm trying to stop him.
Linx才在帮，我一直想阻止他

59
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:28,875
SARAH: Linx?

60
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:31,640
Yes, perhaps you're lucky enough not to have met him yet.
是的，也许你是运气太好了，还没有碰到他

61
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:34,685
Nasty, brutish and short just about sums him up.
用几个词来总结的话，他是个险恶, 野蛮和短小的家伙

62
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,001
There was a strange-looking knight with Irongron.
Irongron 那里是有一个长相奇特的骑士

00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:41,602
Yes, he'd have looked even stranger
if he hadn't been wearing space armour.
是的，如果他没有戴太空头盔的话，会看起来更奇怪

He comes from a planet
where the surface gravity is many times that of Earth.

65
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:47,203
- A man from the stars?
- Mmm-hmm.
- 一个从星星上来的人？  - 嗯哼

66
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,757
- How do I know you're telling the truth?
- Because I never lie.

00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:52,803
Well, hardly ever.

In an advisory capacity, yes.

They asked me to look into this question
of the missing scientists for them.

72
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,640
But I thought you were responsible for that.

73
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:08,685
My dear girl, I don't go round kidnapping scientists!
亲爱的姑娘，我不会去绑架科学家！

74
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,122
No, Linx brought them here to staff his workshop.
不，Linx 把他们带到这里来了，用作他工作间的工人

75
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:13,437
Now I've got to find a way of sending them back to their own time.
现在我得找到一个方法，把他们送回自己的时间去

76
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:17,042
- This is the magician?
- Yes. This is the Doctor.

How do you do?

It is a pleasure and a privilege
to be in the company of civilised people at last.
我很高兴，也很荣幸，终于见到文明人了

80
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:26,722
A courtly rogue.
这家伙还挺有礼貌

81
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:30,763
Is he willing to change his allegiance and serve Sir Edward instead of Irongron?
他愿意改变效忠对象，从 Irongron 转向为爱德华爵士服务吗？

82
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,918
Well, he says he wasn't serving Irongron.
哦，他说他没在为 Irongron 服务

83
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:35,760
And there is another stranger at the castle, someone called Linx.
在那个城堡里还有另外一个陌生人，叫 Linx

84
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:38,042
Yes, he's your enemy, I assure you,
not me.
是的，他才是你的敌人，我不是，我向你保证

85
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:40,641
We'd be well advised to join forces against him.
我倒非常建议我们连起手来对付他

86
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:43,116
- Does he speak truth?
- I'm not sure.
- 他说的是实情吗？  - 我不太确定

87
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:45,084
I suppose I could have been wrong.
我想我可能是搞错了

88
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:46,646
That's a generous admission.
那还算坦诚

89
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:48,558
Especially coming from one of the fair sex.
尤其是这话来自一位公平的性别（FIXME）

90
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:51,115
Or he could just be changing sides to save his own skin.
也或者他是临阵倒戈，只是为了自己的小命

91
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:54,244
These wizards and warlocks were ever a treacherous breed.
巫师和术士从来都是奸诈的家伙

92
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:56,318
We'd best be wary of him.
我们最好小心他

93
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:58,315
I shall spare your life
我打算饶了你的命

94
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:02,400
if you cast your spells and incantations
to help me against Irongron, Doctor.
前提是你要帮我，用魔法与咒语对付 Irongron，博士

95
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,318
Refuse and you die.
如果拒绝你就死了

96
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:07,961
You offer a somewhat restricted choice, Sir Edward.
你给我的选择很有限啊，爱德华爵士

97
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:10,197
EDWARD: What is your answer?
你的答案是什么？

98
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:13,686
My services are at your disposal, sir.
我听候您的差遣，爵士

99
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,604
- Such as they are.
- Good.

100
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,840
Serve me straight, Doctor, and I shall reward you well.
为我服务，博士，我将给你很好的回报

101
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:23,357
Oh, master... Oh, but, master, Irongron marches here before noon!
噢，主人...但是，主人，Irongron 的队伍午前就能到达这里！

102
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:25,165
We heard this said from his own mouth.
我们听到他亲口说的

103
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:28,557
Then we are lost. We cannot stand against them.
那我们就完了，我们没法跟他们对抗

104
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:31,400
- On the contrary, sir, I think we can.
- But how? With a handful of men?
- 恰恰相反，爵士，我觉得我们可以 - 怎么对抗？就这几个人？

105
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:35,555
Yes, sir, with just a few men I think I can persuade Irongron that we have a full garrison.
是的，爵士，虽然只有几个人，我想我能让 Irongron 认为我们驻扎了大批人马

106
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:38,445
By the use of your magic?
凭着你的魔法？

107
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:40,245
By creating an illusion, anyway.
制造一个假象就行

108
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:44,320
Your magic will have to be powerful
indeed to discourage Irongron.
你的魔法必须的足够强大才能吓退 Irongron

109
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:46,079
It will be, sir.
会的，爵士

110
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,959
- The men are ready, Captain.
- Good.
- 人都就绪了，头儿   - 很好

111
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:51,878
Though for such an easy conquest
as this,
即便是一趟如此容易的任务

112
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:54,561
'tis scarce worth strapping on armour!
穿戴上盔甲还是值得的

113
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,081
You and I alone, good Bloodaxe,
could take that castle!
我的好 Bloodaxe，你跟我两个人，就可以拿下这座城堡！

114
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,600
Indeed we could, Captain.
我们还真可以，头儿

115
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:00,643
With Sir Edward's treasure I shall hire more men,
夺了爱德华爵士的财宝，我又可以招募更多人手了

116
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:04,481
and with Linx's weapons to arm them,
who shall stand against us?
再配备上 Linx 制造的武器，谁还敢跟我们做对？

117
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:06,643
When does the fighting start, Irongron?
战斗什么时候开始，Irongron?

118
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:09,480
In the time it takes to ride from here to Sir Edward's castle.
我们从这里出发去爱德华爵士的城堡，一到就开打

00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,035
- Then I shall come with you.
- What, you?
- 那我跟你一起去？  - 什么，你？

120
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,245
Ha! Bloodaxe, on my oath,
can you see that on a scaling ladder?

121
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:19,197
I have an interest in seeing the battle.
我有兴趣观看战斗过程

122
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:22,006
Those eyes have a thirst for blood.
那双眼睛很渴望见血啊

123
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:25,284
Well, find our bold warrior a horse, Bloodaxe.
好，给我们勇敢的战士找一匹马，Bloodaxe

124
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:27,920
Come, then!

- Here's a few more for you, Doctor.
- Thank you, Sarah.
- 这里还给你找了一些，博士  - 谢谢你，莎拉

126
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:38,962
Lady Eleanor's got every serving wench
in the castle sewing away like mad.
Eleanor 夫人让城堡里面的所有侍女都在做缝制，跟疯了似的

127
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:41,402
I told you there'd be plenty of work
for everybody, didn't I?
我跟你说过每个人都有很多工作要做，对不？

128
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:43,842
Oh. Typically masculine arrangement, though.
噢，这安排就是典型的大男子主义

129
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:46,236
We do all the dirty work, you get all the fun.
所有脏活累活都我们干，你就乐趣独享

130
00:07:46,327 --> 00:07:49,763
You don't think mixing this singularly noxious compound is fun, do you?
你不会认为搅拌这些罕见的有毒化合物是一种乐趣吧，是吗？

131
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:52,202
- How's the rest of it going?
- Not bad.
- 其它事情怎么样了？  - 不赖

132
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:55,006
I put Sir Edward in charge of painting the dummies' faces.
我让爱德华爵士负责画这些假人的脸

133
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:57,043
He's turned out to be quite an artist.
结果发现他还是个不错的艺术家

134
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,965
- Once I'd set him on the right lines.
- Excellent.
- 看来我还给他安排对了 - 非常好

135
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:03,238

As yet, we still need Linx's aid.

you will need them to take it hence.
