-You wish for my answer, Doctor?
-I do.

3
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:37,678
Then here it is.

4
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:42,882
SARAH: No!

5
00:00:45,485 --> 00:00:49,558
The female, too.
It seems I am doubly fortunate.

6
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:53,758
-Get up. Get back to work!
-DOCTOR: Linx.

7
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:58,840
Can't you see that your prisoners
are physically exhausted?

8
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:01,241
They've had no sleep
and nothing to eat for days.

9
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:03,793
-They can still work!
-Not for much longer.

10
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:06,240
LINX: I owe these primitives nothing.

11
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:10,284
My only concern is to rejoin
our glorious struggle for freedom.

12
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:12,754
DOCTOR: That's such an old tune.

13
00:01:12,845 --> 00:01:15,234
Don't you know there's no such thing
as the super race?

14
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,840
Your Time Lord philosophy
is egalitarian twaddle.

15
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:20,643
It is a weakness.

16
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:23,478
Every species
has its own weakness, Linx.

17
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:28,603
For instance, you can only be stunned
by a blow on the probic vent,

18
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,678
that small hole
at the back of your neck.

19
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:33,596
LINX: In our case, Doctor,
it is a strength,

20
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:36,438
because it means we must
always face our enemies.

21
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:39,835
Now, to return to the question
of your demise.

22
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:41,483
I think it would be better

23
00:01:41,565 --> 00:01:46,241
if you witnessed first the destruction
of your female companion.

24
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,443
Well done, Rubeish.

25
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:57,155
-Doctor, are you all right?
-Yes.

26
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:00,679
Yes. The blast was too brief.

27
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:02,517
But I wouldn't have been
in a few moments.

28
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:05,483
-Thank you very much, Sarah.
-Oh, pleasure.

29
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:10,041
Hadn't I better be getting on
with the rest of your plan?

30
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:13,401
-Yes. All right, but be careful.
-You, too, Doctor.

31
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:18,756
Right. Well, if we can secure
our friend here,

32
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:22,723
we can get on with the job of restoring
his wretched victims.

33
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:24,557
Will this help?

34
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,113
Rubeish, you're invaluable,
my dear chap.

35
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:31,597
-Bloodaxe.
-Captain.

36
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,277
Fetch me Linx.

37
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:36,323
Fetch me that scabby-faced stoat
from his burrow.

38
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:38,043
At once, Captain.

39
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:50,361
Well, that should hold him for a while,
even on this planet.

40
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:51,594
Why this planet?

41
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:54,802
Well, in his own environment,
he weighs several tons.

42
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:57,240
Fortunately, his muscles
have been designed for load bearing

43
00:02:57,325 --> 00:02:59,714
-rather than leverage.
-Fascinating.

44
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,273
I'd always assumed that creatures
from a high-density planet

45
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:04,833
would have developed
a pressure-balanced physiology.

46
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:06,756
For example, if you take
certain types of seaweed...

47
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:09,962
BLOODAXE: Linx! Linx!

48
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:17,156
-Linx?
-DOCTOR: Who speaks?

49
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:19,395
Captain Irongron commands your presence.

50
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,396
Tell him I'm busy.

51
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:24,363
Well, come soon
or we come and fetch you.

52
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:30,680
Who is Irongron? Is he a nice chap?

53
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:33,518
Well, I wouldn't recommend him
for the Royal Society.

54
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:35,994
All right, Rubeish, you know how
to bring these people round?

55
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:37,757
-Yes. A simple, repetitive optical...
-Yes, quite so.

56
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:39,881
-I'll leave you to get on with it.
-What do you propose to do?

57
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:42,240
I was going to preset
this osmic projector.

58
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:44,634
Send these people back
to their own time.

59
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,115
But now I have to find a way
of stalling Irongron.

60
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:55,562
The robot! Yes, of course.

61
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:59,038
That ought to give him
something to think about.

62
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:27,358
Thief!

63
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:31,284
You common scullion, stand aside!

64
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:35,355
How dare you obstruct me?
I shall have you flogged.

65
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:38,005
Oh, so, a lady, are you?

66
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:40,804
-A lady dressed as a serving wench?
-I'm hungry.

67
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:44,673
Please let me go. I've tasted neither
bread nor meat for nearly a month.

68
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:50,724
No, nor done no work for longer
by the look of you.

69
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:53,319
All right, my girl,
I'll give you bread and cheese,

70
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:54,679
but you'll have to earn it.

71
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:00,477
Who are you?

72
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:04,877
DOCTOR: I am a gift to Captain Irongron

73
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:09,402
from the one who made me,
my master, Commander Linx.

74
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:14,637
It is indeed the robot, Bloodaxe,
though somewhat different in shape.

75
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:18,361
And I remember, Linx promised
to make me a second iron man,

76
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,640
one that would obey my voice.

77
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:23,721
But why has Linx sent you?

78
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:26,080
Why has he not himself
obeyed my summons?

79
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:31,285
My master toils in his workshop
to make you more fighting robots.

80
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:35,236
-He sent me as proof of his goodwill.
-What?

81
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:39,678
-Now I must return.
-Hold.

82
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:45,715
I would see something
of the mettle of this gift.

83
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:48,797
-Can you fight, iron man?
-That is my purpose.

84
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:52,281
Then fight me.

85
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:56,153
I was programmed to fight for you,
not against you.

86
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:59,999
-Cease thy gabble and fight.
-You will damage my circuits.

87
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:01,677
Fight, iron man,

88
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:05,718
or you'll return to Linx in as
many pieces as did your brother.

89
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:36,960
Hold.

90
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:42,317
It's truly a marvel, Captain.
Never have I seen a finer swordsman.

91
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:46,637
Ah, 'tis great sport this, Bloodaxe.
Draw your sword and join me.

92
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:49,797
We'll try this creature's strength
to the utmost.

93
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:52,036

100
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:16,283
Hold, I say!

101
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:21,636
We must slow this
iron man's speed a little.

102
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:24,637
Stick me some crossbow bolts
in the creature.

103
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:28,320
We'll see if it fights as well with
a crossbow bolt or two in its gizzard.

104
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:29,804
And if that fails,

105
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:31,955
we'll lop off its head
and try again then.

Why?

112
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:50,317

it might give you a seizure.

No.

116
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:22,836
The sword is too quick and clean
a death for you.

117
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:26,234
Well, since you are a wizard,

-Him and his chamber guard.

-How many's that?
-Half a dozen.

124
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:48,559
-You're full of questions, girl.
-Don't the guards on the gate get stew?

125
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:52,524
What? Meat for those common creatures?
I should say not.

126
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:54,596
They'll have oatmeal,
the same as the rest of us,

127
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:56,357

-Then you should set yourselves free.

-Oh, and how should we do that?
-Don't you want to be free?

-You're young and foolish, girl.

And I warn you,
keep those thoughts to yourself

-any more than you do.
-IRONGRON: Linx!

Oh, there you are, you dragon-eyed toad.

163
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:09,954
-Who put these bonds on you?
-The Doctor.

164
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:14,516
I was struck from behind.

165
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,879
-Where is he?
-The Doctor is dying.

166
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:22,839

to destroy him?

167

Thank you, sir,
for your charm and old world courtesy.

May I ask the purpose
of this tomfoolery?

169

why don't you get on with it?

of use to you, Irongron.

with their star weapons.

The aim improves, Doctor. Be patient.

183

We shall hit the target
all in good time.

There are innocent people
in that castle, my lady,

Yes, I see. Where's Linx?

I don't know. He started
his spaceship going then cleared off.

Where's the osmic projector?
It was over there on the table.

He put everything back inside the ship.

243
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:27,393
I'll just have to
take it out again, won't I?

244
00:17:27,484 --> 00:17:29,998
Hal, scout around the castle.

245
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:31,756
See if Irongron and his men
are sleeping.

246
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,994
If they are, disarm them
and come back here.

What are you going to do, Doctor?

248

Get the osmic projector.
Fortunately, it's an independent unit.

308
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:26,719
Doctor, do get up.
We've got to get you out.

Something's gone wrong.

He must have hit
the takeoff button too soon.

312
00:22:40,962 --> 00:22:44,398
Come on, we've got about a minute
to get out of here. Quick! Run!

315

Well, you can tell Sir Edward
that his problems are over, Hal.

316
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,078
Irongron, his castle,

317
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:30,959
his magic weapons and his sorcerer,
they're all destroyed.

318
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:32,594
Will you not tell him yourself, Doctor?

319
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:35,275
He will reward you well.
We owe you much.

320
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:38,194
I'm sorry. I'm afraid we must be off.

321
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:40,556
-Goodbye, Hal.
-Goodbye, Doctor.

-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

323
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:47,510
You are truly a great magician, Doctor.

324
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:51,037
To tell you the truth, Hal,
I'm not a magician at all.

325
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:53,991
I'm not so sure about that.
