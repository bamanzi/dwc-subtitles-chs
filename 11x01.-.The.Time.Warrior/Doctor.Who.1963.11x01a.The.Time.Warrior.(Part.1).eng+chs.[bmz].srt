Sour wine! Is this how I'm served?
酸酒！我就只能得到这样服侍吗？

Our supplies are low, Captain. 
It's some time since we went aforaging.
我们的供应不足, 头儿。我们四处搜罗已经有一段时间了

16
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:21,440
Meanwhile our fine neighbours feast their bellies
full on fresh meat
为什么我们的邻居这个时候肚子里装满了鲜肉

17
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:23,834
and swill down flagons of fine wine.
杯子里晃荡着美酒？

18
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:27,315
Well, Sir Edward's storehouses and cellars are well-stocked.
是啊, Edward 爵士的仓库和酒窖储备都很充足

19
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:31,193
Then perhaps we should relieve him 
of some of his abundance, eh, my friend?
那或许我们应该帮他减轻一点负担啊, 对不, 我的朋友？

20
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:34,197
He's a good neighbour. He'll not miss a little of his plenty.
他是一个好邻居啊。他那么多东西, 丢掉一点点他也不会在意的

21
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:35,874

To find the star before some knave robs me of it.
It landed close by.
去找星星, 免得一会儿被些混混给抢走了。它落在附近了

A star. A fallen star.

Careful, Captain, looks like the devil's work to me.
小心点, 头儿, 看起来像是魔鬼的杰作

00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,798
A warrior? A warrior from the stars!
Have you come to challenge me?
一位勇士？从星星上来的勇士！你是来向我挑战的吗？

Fear not. I shall not harm you.

I am a Sontaran officer.

My name is Linx.
我的名字是 Linx

00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:03,277
I say he's a Saracen. I have heard tales of his Eastern magic.
我觉得他是个撒拉逊人, 我听说过他那些东方魔法的传说

00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:19,115

for the greater glory of the Sontaran Empire.

Help you? Why should I help you, star warrior?
帮你？为什么我要帮你, 星星勇士？

56
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:37,071
Why should I not kill you and take your ship
and its treasure for myself?
为什么我不杀了你, 抢走你的船和船里的宝贝呢？

57
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:39,311
LINX: The ship is in need of repair.
这艘船需要维修

58
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:42,996
Even if it were not, you would destroy
yourself should you tamper with it.
即使它不需要维修, 你去动它的话你同样会完蛋

59
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:46,437
Then why should I not just slay you for sport?
那要不然我就只宰掉你, 寻个开心？

60
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:50,070
Can you overcome all of us with your magic?
你能搞定我们所有人吗 — 用你的“魔法”？

00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,594
I took this castle by force of arms.

Those that were here before me, I slew.

64
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:11,160
All the countryside around here pays my tribute.

Yet no doubt you have enemies?

Other warriors who envy your good fortune?

00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:17,795
Aye, but they cannot harm me.
是有, 不过他们伤害不了我

68
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:21,972
The king has levied tribute.
All their troops are at the wars.

魔法武器吗？ 就像那种...无形中击飞我的剑的那种？

Other weapons fitter for your purpose.

Shelter.
庇护

80
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:59,071
A place to conceal my ship and help with its repair.
需要一个地方把我的飞船藏起来, 还需要有人帮忙进行维修

81
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:03,755
- You have men that can work in metal?
- An armourer to sharpen weapons,
- 你有人会锻造金属不？ - 有个会打造武器的

82
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:06,309
a smith with a forge if these will serve your need.
有铁匠和熔炉, 应该能满足你的需要了

83
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,710
I need more, much more.
我需要很多, 非常多

84
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,440
There is damage to the drive mechanism of my ship.
我的飞船的驱动系统受损了

85
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:14,911
I need alloy, skilled technicians, complex circuitry.
我需要合金, 需要技工, 还有人对付复杂的电路

86
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:18,437
Oh, we have none of these things of which you speak.
哦, 你说的这些我们一样也没有

87
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:22,194
Then I must take them from those who have.
那我只能自己找了

88
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:33,756
In here, Brigadier?
是这里吗, 准将？

89
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:36,753
Yes, I'm afraid so, Doctor. Not exactly the Ritz, I know,
是的, 恐怕是这样, 博士。不是值得炫耀的地方, 我知道

90
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:40,536
but it's no joke providing emergency accommodation
for all these scientists.
但要给这么多科学家提供紧急住所, 也不是容易的事情

91
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:42,791
All right, Brigadier,
you've had your little bit of mystification.
好吧, 准将, 你已经完成了你的小奇迹

92
00:06:42,881 --> 00:06:46,414
Now I know where I'm supposed to stay,
perhaps you wouldn't mind telling me why?
现在我知道我应该呆在哪里了。但或许你能告诉我这都是为什么？

93
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:50,900
This place is one of the most top secret
security establishments in the whole country.
这个地方是全国最绝密的安全机构之一

94
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:52,274
Most of their work is so secret, 
这里的人所做的事情是如此机密

95
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:53,714
they don't know what they're doing themselves.
他们自己都不知道自己在做些什么

96
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:54,836
And?
怎么？

97
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:56,991
It's also one of the best-guarded places in the country.
这里也是全国安保措施最好的地方之一

98
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,799
Security details, alarm systems...
安全检查, 告警系统...

99
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,712
I rather gathered that when we arrived.
我们到这里的时候我都注意到了

100
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:03,190
For a moment I thought they weren't going to let you in.
有那么一会儿我以为他们连你都不允许进来了

101
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:06,916
Yes, exactly. The place is almost too security conscious.
是的, 的确如此, 这个地方似乎在安全上有点过于过分了

102
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:10,440
That's what makes it all the more puzzling.
但这就使得问题更加令人困惑了

103
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,910
Makes what all the more puzzling?
使得什么问题更令人困惑？

104
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:16,355
Come on, Brigadier, you can tell me.
好啦, 准将, 你可以跟我说的

105
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,277
- People vanishing.
- People?
- 有人消失  - 有人？

106
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,872
Well, they've lost. Half a dozen leading scientists
是的, 他们不见了。半打顶尖科学家

107
00:07:21,961 --> 00:07:24,680
and several million pounds' worth of ultra-secret equipment.
还有几百万英镑的超级机密设备

108
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:27,275
What are they working on here anyway?
他们到底在这里是研究什么的？

109
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:31,798
Space hardware. New alloys, guidance systems,
methods of propulsion.
太空材料、新型合金、导航系统、太空推进器等

110
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:34,873
- And what action have you taken so far?
- Well, I had rather a bright idea.
- 目前位置你都采取了什么措施没有？  - 哦, 我有一个不错的想法

111
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:37,236
It's pretty hard to keep an eye
on all these scientist chaps at home,
如果让这些科学家呆在家里, 我们很难全部盯住他们

112
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:40,518
so I had these cubicles put up on several floors.
所以我让人在这几层搭了这些小格间

113
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:44,870
Confined the whole lot to barracks,
all my eggs in one basket so to speak.
把这些人都圈到这里, 简单地说, 所有的鸡蛋都到一个篮子了

114
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:48,476
That's fine, so long as no one steals the basket.
这不错啊——如果没人能偷走这个篮子的话

115
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:08,114
(BANGING ON DOOR)

116
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:11,113
Linx! My Lord Linx!
Linx！Linx 大人!

117
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:13,433
Will you open the door?
你能打开门吗？

118
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:17,673
LINX: None may enter here.
Such was my agreement with your captain.
没人可以进来。这是我跟你们头领达成的协议

119
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:20,355
Yay, it is my captain who sent me.
知道, 但正是我们头儿派我来的

120
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:22,636
He would have words with you, Lord Linx.
他想跟你谈谈, Linx 大人

121
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:26,157
Then tell him I'm occupied. Now leave me to my work.
那告诉他我没空, 别打扰我工作

122
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,754
(BANGS ON DOOR)

123
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,959
Insolent primitives. Did I not need their aid...
无礼的原始人。我干脆不要他们帮忙算了...

124
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,995
Where is the star warrior?
星星勇士在哪儿？

125
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:45,015
He would not come. He says he's occupied.
他不肯来, 他说他正忙

126
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:49,196
Oh, the insolent barbarian.
Did I not need his help, I'd...
噢, 无礼的野蛮人。我不要他的帮助, 我要...

127

See, Bloodaxe. The first of the new weapons.

Oh! Claps the ears!

I'll soon master the aim.

哦, 明白了, 对不起。嗨, 你好

It's disgraceful, of course. Utterly disgraceful.

Oh? What is?

136
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:14,232
Well, shutting us up. Like a lot of kids kept in after school.
不让我们说话, 就好像我们放学后被留住的小孩子似的

137
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:16,232
And that brigadier chap, military idiot.
就那个准将, 没脑子的军人

- I'm sorry?
- 今天这里好像有好多史密斯  - 什么？

Doctor, I'm intrigued. What's that for?
博士, 我很好奇, 那是做什么用的？

00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,635
That? Oh, that, that contains my equipment, Professor.
那个, 哦, 那个是用来装我的设备的, 教授

- Thank you.
- 令人非常印象深刻 - 谢谢你

尤其是我意识到, 你写那篇论文的时候应该才五岁

啊, 喔...是的, 这的确很难解释, 是吧

You're going to try, aren't you?
你不尝试解释一下吗？

你应该知道你呆的这个地方是非常危险的吧？

只是, 我忍不住。不过现在被困住了

Well, you can make yourself useful.

We need somebody around here to make the coffee.
我们这里需要有人泡个咖啡什么的

But for how long, Edward?

我们还要忍受这种毫无教养的野蛮邻居多久？

He flouts your authority every day,

your authority which comes from the King.

爱德华爵士的人都这么面黄肌瘦的吗？

啊！我认不出这些诺曼人潦草的字迹

Think that tomorrow will be brighter.
想想明天会更好

208

Edward, I've heard that Irongron
walks his battlements every morning.
爱德华, 我听说 Irongron 每天早上都练兵

Oh, it pleases him to be high. He's like a cockerel.
哦, 他就喜欢那样, 像个好斗的小公鸡

that I am not of your kind, Irongron.
这个头盔已经说明了, 我跟你们不是同一个种族, Irongron

有人正在谋划一场反对我的战争, 他就是给他们传信的

what you're talking about, Professor.
我觉得我没太搞明白你在说什么, 教授

- And do you know what he says?
- Yes. He said that she's in America.
- 你知道他说什么？  - 知道, 他说她现在正在美国呢

248
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,319
He said she's in... How could you know?
他说她现在在...你怎么知道的？

249
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,675
Please be careful! This is very delicate equipment.
小心一点！这是非常精巧的设备

250
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,228
What if she's a spy? What do we do?
如果她是一个间谍怎么办？我们该做什么？

251
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,516
- Shoot her?
- Ha! There's something odd about her.
- 枪杀她？ - 哈, 她是有点奇怪

252
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,397
She even tried to tell me you were a spy.
她还试着跟我说过, 说你是个间谍

253
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,835
Am I on the right floor?
我没走错楼层吧？

254
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,514
- Good night.
- Good night, Professor.
- 晚安  - 晚安, 教授

255
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,515
- What's that?
- That's my alarm clock.
- 那是什么？  - 那是我的告警钟

256
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,876
Oh, Doctor, kindly don't be so patronising.
Now, what is it really?
哦, 博士, 不要这么拒人千里嘛。说真的, 这是什么？

257
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,157
It's a rhondium sensor. It detects delta particles.
这是一个铑探测器, 它可以检测到德尔塔粒子

258
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,800
At a preset spectrum density of 1 5 ams,
只要浓度达到预设的15am

259
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,110
it oscillates this little cylinder there,
这里的小棍就会振动

260
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,875
which promotes a vacuum in there, which wakes me up. Clear?
从而推动这个真空管, 从而向我发出告警, 清楚了吗？

261
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,197
Why do you want to be woken up
when it detects delta particles?
为什么你想要它检测到德尔塔粒子就向你告警

262
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,271
Because I am very fond of delta particles.
因为我非常喜欢德尔塔粒子

263
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,194
- Why do you ask so many questions?
- Because I'm a journalist.
- 为什么你要问这么多问题  - 因为我是个新闻记者

264
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,514
- Are you going to sleep there?
- If you'll allow me to do so.
- 那你打算睡在那里吗？  - 如果你允许的话

265
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,111
Good night, Miss Smith.
晚安,史密斯小姐

Shouldn't we tell the Brigadier?

- Tell the Brigadier what?
- About her.
- 通知准将什么？  - 她的事

269
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,912

我想我们能决定拿史密斯小姐怎么办

270
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,117
in the morning, Professor, if we're all still here.
到了明早就能决定了, 教授 —— 如果我们还在这里的话

271
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,272
He has a stout heart, this one, sire. He speaks not a word.
他骨头还挺硬啊, 大人。一个字也不说

272
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,397
Good. A fair measure for you, Linx.
好, 就看你的了, Linx

But you've done nothing.
你什么也没干啊

问吧

279

How many men guard Sir Edward's castle?
爱德华爵士的城堡有多少人守卫？

280
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,110
There are but 10, old men for the most part.
只有不到10个人, 其中大部分还是老人

281
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,952
And he plans to attack me with 10 old men?
那他就打算用这10个老人来攻打我？

282
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,428
He sends messages to raise a force against you.
他送信让召集人马来对付你

283
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,872
If he succeed, then he will attack.

别走, Linx! 我说过让你走了吗？

对我的剑发誓, Bloodaxe

He can't have gone far.
