Stars are falling!

10
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:43,917
It has fallen in the forest!

11
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:45,895
Come on, get up. Get up! Get up!

12
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:47,462
It is an omen.

13
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:49,773
- An evil sign! - It is mine.

14
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:52,013
Irongron's star. I will have it!

15
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:55,095
- Hurry. Fetch the horses.
- Hurry? Hurry where?

16
00:00:55,183 --> 00:00:58,732
To find the star before some knave robs me of it.
It landed close by.

17
00:00:58,823 --> 00:01:02,896
But the forest is still in darkness.
Who knows what demons may set upon us?

18
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:06,498
Why, you chicken-hearted knaves, every man of you!

19
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:10,258
It's but an hour till dawn! Let's wait till then.

20
00:01:10,343 --> 00:01:14,177
To wait and see what faces us. We'll follow you then, Captain.

21
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:23,479
Let all be made ready. I ride at dawn. - Alone if need be.

22
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:25,058
We're with you, Captain.

23
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:27,179
Then bring me some wine.

24
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:29,936
We'll drink a toast to Irongron's star.

25
00:01:46,803 --> 00:01:49,636
A star. A fallen star.

26
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:52,191
Careful, Captain, looks like the devil's work to me.

27
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:02,798
A warrior? A warrior from the stars!
Have you come to challenge me?

30
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:12,780
- What creature is this?
- 'Tis a devil from hell.

31
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:20,450
Peace.

32
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,939
Fear not. I shall not harm you.

33
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:27,099
It speaks. Who are you? Where do you come from?

34
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:29,411
I am a Sontaran officer.

35
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:31,756
My name is Linx.

36
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:35,911
Help you? Why should I help you, star warrior?

37
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:40,071
Why should I not kill you and take your ship
and its treasure for myself?

38
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,311
LINX: The ship is in need of repair.

39
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:45,996
Even if it were not, you would destroy
yourself should you tamper with it.

40
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:49,437
Then why should I not just slay you for sport?

41
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:53,070
Can you overcome all of us with your magic?

42
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:03,870
LINX: You are a soldier, are you not? A warrior?

43
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:06,794
I took this castle by force of arms.

44
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:09,634
Those that were here before me, I slew.

45
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:12,360
All the countryside around here pays my tribute.

46
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:14,397
Yet no doubt you have enemies?

47
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:16,312
Other warriors who envy your good fortune?

48
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:18,995
Aye, but they cannot harm me.

49
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:23,172
The king has levied tribute.
All their troops are at the wars.

50
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,315
And when they return?

51
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:27,153
Then we shall fight.

52
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:30,151
I can give you weapons,

53
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:33,790
weapons that can make you masters,
so that none dare stand against you.

54
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,932
You shall take what castles you will.

55
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:40,113
Magic weapons? Like that, that smote the sword from my hand?

56
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:42,954
Other weapons fitter for your purpose.

57
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,760
Weapons that can strike a man dead from far away.

58
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:49,516
- You can be supreme warrior.
- I can be king.

59
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:54,790
But what do you ask in return, apart from your life?

60
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,872
Shelter.

61
00:03:56,961 --> 00:04:00,271
A place to conceal my ship and help with its repair.

62
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:04,955
- You have men that can work in metal?
- An armourer to sharpen weapons,

63
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,509
a smith with a forge if these will serve your need.

64
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,910
I need more, much more.

65
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:12,640
There is damage to the drive mechanism of my ship.

66
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:16,111
I need alloy, skilled technicians, complex circuitry.

67
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:19,637
Oh, we have none of these things of which you speak.

68
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,394
Then I must take them from those who have.

69
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:34,956
In here, Brigadier?

70
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,953
Yes, I'm afraid so, Doctor. Not exactly the Ritz, I know,

71
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,736
but it's no joke providing emergency accommodation
for all these scientists.

72
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:43,991
All right, Brigadier,
you've had your little bit of mystification.

73
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:47,614
Now I know where I'm supposed to stay,
perhaps you wouldn't mind telling me why?

74
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:52,100
This place is one of the most top secret
security establishments in the whole country.

75
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:53,474
Most of their work is so secret,

76
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,914
they don't know what they're doing themselves.

77
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:56,036
And?

78
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:58,191
It's also one of the best-guarded places in the country.

79
00:04:58,281 --> 00:04:59,999
Security details, alarm systems...

80
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:01,912
I rather gathered that when we arrived.

81
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,390
For a moment I thought they weren't going to let you in.

82
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:08,116
Yes, exactly. The place is almost too security conscious.

83
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:11,640
That's what makes it all the more puzzling.

84
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:14,110
Makes what all the more puzzling?

85
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,555
Come on, Brigadier, you can tell me.

86
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:20,477
- People vanishing.
- People?

87
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:23,072
Well, they've lost. Half a dozen leading scientists

88
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:25,880
and several million pounds' worth of ultra-secret equipment.

89
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:28,475
What are they working on here anyway?

90
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:32,998
Space hardware. New alloys, guidance systems,
methods of propulsion.

91
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:36,073
- And what action have you taken so far?
- Well, I had rather a bright idea.

92
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,436
It's pretty hard to keep an eye
on all these scientist chaps at home,

93
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:41,718
so I had these cubicles put up on several floors.

94
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:46,070
Confined the whole lot to barracks,
all my eggs in one basket so to speak.

95
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:49,676
That's fine, so long as no one steals the basket.

96
00:05:57,961 --> 00:05:59,314
(BANGING ON DOOR)

97
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,313
Linx! My Lord Linx!

98
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:04,633
Will you open the door?

99
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:08,873
LINX: None may enter here.
Such was my agreement with your captain.

100
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:11,555
Yay, it is my captain who sent me.

101
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:13,836
He would have words with you, Lord Linx.

102
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:17,357
Then tell him I'm occupied. Now leave me to my work.

103
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:18,954
(BANGS ON DOOR)

104
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:23,159
Insolent primitives. Did I not need their aid...

105
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:28,895
Where is the star warrior?

106
00:06:28,981 --> 00:06:31,915
He would not come. He says he's occupied.

107
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:36,096
Oh, the insolent barbarian.
Did I not need his help, I'd...

108
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:39,139
See, Bloodaxe. The first of the new weapons.

109
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:40,810
Watch!

110
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,217
Oh! Claps the ears!

111
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:45,815
I'll soon master the aim.

112
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:48,379
Rubeish.

113
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:50,611
- I beg your pardon?
- Joseph Rubeish.

114
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,692
Oh, I see. I'm so sorry. Hello. How do you do?

115
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:54,578
It's disgraceful, of course. Utterly disgraceful.

116
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:55,492
Oh? What is?

117
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,132
Well, shutting us up. Like a lot of kids kept in after school.

118
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:01,132
And that brigadier chap, military idiot.

119
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,496
Yes, I know how you feel. Still, he means well, you know.

120
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:05,378
Haven't seen my wife and family for three days.

121
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:06,610
I'm sorry to hear that.

122
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:09,852
Ah, well, just shows there's always a silver lining.

123
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:14,059
- And your name?
- Uh, Smith, Dr John Smith.

124
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:17,019
- Seems to be a lot of them about today.
- I'm sorry?

125
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:19,854
I was talking to a young woman just now, also Smith.

126
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,057
- Well, there she is. Miss Smith?
- Yes, Professor?

127
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,256
Come and meet your namesake.

128
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:26,538
- Miss Lavinia Smith, Doctor, uh...
- Dr John Smith.

129
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:28,819
- How do you do, Miss Smith?
- Hello.

130
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:31,859
Doctor, I'm intrigued. What's that for?

131
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:34,535
That? Oh, that, that contains my equipment, Professor.

132
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,213
That's original.

133
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:39,898
- You're the virologist, Miss Smith?
- Yes.

134
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,858
Who told you?

135
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:44,580
I read your paper on the teleological response of the virus,

136
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:47,129
- a most impressive piece of work.
- Thank you.

137
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:50,770
Particularly when I realised,
you must have written it when you were five years old.

138
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:54,939
Ah, uh... Yes, that is rather difficult to explain, isn't it?

139
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:58,155
You're going to try, aren't you?

140
00:07:58,421 --> 00:08:02,254
Well, um... My Aunt Lavinia is in America
on a lecture tour, you see.

141
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:05,094
- Mmm-hmm.
- She had an invitation to visit here.

142
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:07,411
- I took her place.
- Why?

143
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:09,457
I thought all this might give me a good story.

144
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,055
I'm a journalist. Sarah Jane Smith.

145
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:15,049
You realise this is a very dangerous place to be in?

146
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:17,132
Well, I can't help that. I'm stuck here now.

147
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:20,691
Anyway, we've got all these soldiers looking after us.

148
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:23,420
Are you going to give me away, Doctor?

149
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:29,617
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

150
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:31,532
Well, you can make yourself useful.

151
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:33,771
We need somebody around here to make the coffee.

152
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:36,819
If you think I'm going to spend my time
making cups of coffee for you...

153
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:38,129
Professor!

154
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:41,099
Would you kindly desist? This is not a blackboard, you know.

155
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:43,217
Oh, I do beg your pardon, Doctor. I was just trying to prove...

156
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:46,134
What are you going to do in there?

157
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:49,133
Make myself a cup of coffee. Good day to you.

158
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,651
We caught this little rabbit in the forest, sire.

159
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,250
Sir Edward's squire.

160
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,573
- Are you loyal to your lord, boy?
- I am.

161
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,215
We shall see.

162
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,219
He carried this. He tried to eat it when we caught him.

163
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,219
Are Sir Edward's men so ill-fed?

164
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,691
Bah! I make nothing of their Norman scribbles.

165
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,658
- What's it say?
- I cannot read, Captain.

166
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,049
What's the message say, boy?

167
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,132
So your Sir Edward is going to attack me, eh?

168
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,731
Well, speak.

169
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,616
I know nothing.

170
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,893
Take him below. We'll loosen his tongue presently.

171
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,419
- Edward.
- What is it? Is Eric back?

172
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,856
- You haven't eaten all day.
- Why does he not return?

173
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,818
I could have ridden to my Lord
of Salisbury's castle three times over.

174

- It's not good for you to worry so much.
- How can I not worry?

176
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,890
Edward, I've heard that Irongron
walks his battlements every morning.

177
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,540
Oh, it pleases him to be high. He's like a cockerel.

178
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,215
But does he climb so high that an arrow cannot reach him?

179

That strange armour you wear suits you, Linx.

182
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,018
- It is Sontaran space armour.
- But why must we never see your face?

183
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,978
This helmet conceals the fact
that I am not of your kind, Irongron.

184
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,574
You might not find my true appearance pleasing.

185
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,854
(CHUCKLING) By my sword, Linx,
I'll wage you're the fairest beauty in the castle.

186
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,818
Why did you summon me? You know my work is pressing.

187
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,416
I have a prisoner in the dungeon,
a surly fellow who will not speak.

188
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,809
- And you wish him to?
- Yes.

189
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,778
Then give him to me. I will make him speak.

190
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,213
Tell Bloodaxe to bring up the prisoner.

191
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,852
Well, Linx, you cunning old devil,

192
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,091
what fresh tricks can you show Irongron, eh?

193
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,819
What is the nature of the information you seek?

194
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,539
He's a messenger of those who plot a war against me.

195
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,338
A war? That is excellent.

when I should be leading my squadron to glory.

202

- I am an expert at war, Irongron.
- I know.

203

204

No, no. Listen, she's not Miss Smith.

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,810
- She isn't?
- No. Who is she?

212
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,015
I don't think I quite understand
what you're talking about, Professor.

213
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,933
Just now I was in the common room with Sir Maxwell Dingle.

214
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,738
I happened to mention I was on the same landing
with Lavinia Smith, the virologist.

215
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,730
- And do you know what he says?
- Yes. He said that she's in America.

216
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,219
He said she's in... How could you know?

217
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,575
Please be careful! This is very delicate equipment.

218
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,128
What if she's a spy? What do we do?

219
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,416
- Shoot her?
- Ha! There's something odd about her.

220
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,297
She even tried to tell me you were a spy.

221
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,735
Am I on the right floor?

222
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,414
- Good night.
- Good night, Professor.

223
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,415
- What's that?
- That's my alarm clock.

224
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,776
Oh, Doctor, kindly don't be so patronising.
Now, what is it really?

225
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,057
It's a rhondium sensor. It detects delta particles.

226
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,097
Why do you want to be woken up
when it detects delta particles?

227
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,171
Because I am very fond of delta particles.

228
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,094
- Why do you ask so many questions?
- Because I'm a journalist.

229
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,414
- Are you going to sleep there?
- If you'll allow me to do so.

231
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,172
He has a stout heart, this one, sire. He speaks not a word.

232
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,297
Good. A fair measure for you, Linx.

But you've done nothing.

This is a key. I have unlocked your prisoner's mind.

238
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:44,057
Question him.

239
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:49,769
How many men guard Sir Edward's castle?

240
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:53,010
There are but 10, old men for the most part.

241
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,852
And he plans to attack me with 10 old men?

242
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:58,328
He sends messages to raise a force against you.

243
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:00,472
If he succeed, then he will attack.

340
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:30,695
It was my Lady Eleanor.

341
00:20:31,906 --> 00:20:34,374
Ah, that narrow-hipped vixen.

342
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:38,581
Bloodaxe, tomorrow we dine at Wessex Castle.

343
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,702
Yes, Captain. And what of the prisoner?

344
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:43,619
Ere long we shall deal with him sharply.

345
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:45,139
(LAUGHING)

346
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:47,660
Sharply, eh? 'Tis richly put.

347
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,295
Aye. That'll be a fine jest, Captain Irongron.

348
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:54,139
I'm not one of your stuffy Norman nobles.

349
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:55,625
I like a bit of rough fun.

350
00:20:55,706 --> 00:20:58,015
'Tis true, Captain, you have a merry wit indeed!

351
00:20:58,106 --> 00:21:01,542
Look, please! Now you've had your laugh,

352
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:04,936
now, you know, just let's stop it and talk sensibly.

353
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:09,178
I mean, if it's any consolation to you,
you're scaring me out of my wits.

354
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:13,544
- Perhaps the wench is crazed, Captain.
- Oh, come on. What is this place?

355
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:16,743
You are in the castle of Irongron, my lady.

356
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:20,785
Few uninvited guests come here,
and few that do leave alive.

357
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:24,575
All right. If you insist on playing guessing games...

358
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:28,705
Now, it's not a village pageant.
It's too elaborate for that.

359
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:32,423
A film set. No, no lights, no cameras.

360
00:21:32,506 --> 00:21:37,136
Aye, the wench is crazed, right enough.
And pity, she's not un-comely.

361
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:42,338
I've got it! It's one of those tourist places.

362
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:46,897
Uh, a medieval castle,
all restored to its original condition

363
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:50,023
with jolly banquets and buxom serving wenches.

364
00:21:50,546 --> 00:21:52,537
That's it, isn't it?

365
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:56,136
Mind you, I think you're overdoing the sordid realism a bit.

366
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:58,945
I mean, I know things were pretty grotty in the Middle Ages,

367
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:02,257
but, really, you might leave the tourists
a bit of glamorous illusion.

368
00:22:02,346 --> 00:22:03,665
I've never seen such a scurvy...

369
00:22:03,746 --> 00:22:06,214
For pity's sake, cease this babbling, girl!

370
00:22:06,306 --> 00:22:07,978
BLOODAXE: Captain.

371
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:13,178
Ah, Linx. What of my weapons? Are they ready?

372
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:16,736
Soon. But I have another weapon to show you.

373
00:22:16,826 --> 00:22:19,977
- For your leave, master, the prisoner?
- Aye, aye.

374
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:22,584
- What is this?
- Eh?

375
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,624
- Oh, just a girl taken in the forest.
- Girl?

376
00:22:26,466 --> 00:22:29,822
- You have two species on this planet?
- How say you?

377
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:33,146
The girl is not of your kind, Irongron.

378
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,298
The hair is finer. The thorax of a different construction.

379
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:38,946
Oh, hell's teeth, have you no girls beyond the stars?

380
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:42,541
- No women to do the lowly work?
- Ah, I understand.

381
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:45,936
You have a primary and secondary reproductive cycle.

382
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,901
It is an inefficient system. You should change it.

383
00:22:48,986 --> 00:22:50,021
You what?

384
00:22:50,106 --> 00:22:52,415
In the Sontaran Military Academy,

385
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:55,782
we have hatchings of a million cadets at each muster parade.

386
00:22:55,866 --> 00:22:58,983
Thus we can sustain enormous casualties on all battlefronts.

387
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:01,536
You cluck away like a broody old hen.

388
00:23:02,786 --> 00:23:05,902
Wait! This cloth is machine-woven.

389
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:07,339
The girl is not of your time, Irongron.

390
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:11,656
Oh, curse the girl! Show me the...

391
00:23:15,986 --> 00:23:20,700
Who? What? How?

392
00:23:20,786 --> 00:23:23,254
Sarah Jane Smith. Reporter.

393
00:23:23,826 --> 00:23:25,782
In a machine. I did not understand it.

394
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:27,345
- What century?
- Twentieth.

395
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:33,098
Your civilisation knows nothing
of time-dimensional technology. Explain.

396
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:36,655
I cannot. It is a machine that
belongs to someone called the Doctor.

397
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:38,303
- Linx...
- Silence!

398
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:41,263
This is important. My mission is threatened.

399
00:23:41,865 --> 00:23:43,014
Explain the Doctor.

400
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:45,824
He is a scientist. He was at the research centre.

401
00:23:45,905 --> 00:23:48,783
He said he was very fond of delta particles.

402
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:51,180
Ah. Is he here?

403
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:55,178
Yes. Somewhere. I was hiding in the machine when he left.

404
00:23:55,265 --> 00:23:56,903
It becomes clear.

405
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,619
Linx, what of the weapon?

406
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:02,738
Very well.

407
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:05,738
It is here.

408
00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:16,981
Who are you? How do you come into my castle?

409
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,616
Well, speak fellow!

410
00:24:21,385 --> 00:24:23,455
Answer me or lose your head for insolence!

411
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:27,299
It cannot answer you.
It is just a suit of steel. It is empty.

412
00:24:27,385 --> 00:24:28,355
But it walks!

413
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:34,374
It walks. And it fights, Irongron. Is it a good weapon?

414
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:36,460
Does it kill?

415
00:24:36,545 --> 00:24:39,423
It does nothing else and it cannot be killed.

416
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:42,542
By heavens, Linx, can you make me more of these?

417
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:43,694
If you wish.

418
00:24:43,785 --> 00:24:47,016
With a few such soldiers as that, I could take the world!

419
00:24:47,105 --> 00:24:49,903
When I have left this dull planet,

420
00:24:49,985 --> 00:24:54,024
it would amuse me to think of it
under the rule of King Irongron.

421
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:56,335
Very well, provide me with all that I ask for

422
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:59,383
- and I can make many more of these.
- It's a bargain.

423
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,854
By heavens, Linx, I never thought when I first saw you

424
00:25:01,945 --> 00:25:03,583
that I should come to love you as a brother.

425
00:25:03,665 --> 00:25:05,498
Now, show me how the iron man works.

426
00:25:05,585 --> 00:25:08,538
Wait. The girl creature has gone.

427
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:11,583
Oh, she'll not get far before one of my guards grabs her tail.

428
00:25:11,665 --> 00:25:15,260
Now, show me. Show me how it fights. Make it walk again.

429
00:25:26,664 --> 00:25:29,815
Sarah? Miss Smith. Come back!

430
00:25:48,744 --> 00:25:51,656
- Stay! Bloodaxe.
- Sire.

- I'll fight any man, my lord.

You'll see some sport now, Bloodaxe. Here, fellow.

435
00:26:22,504 --> 00:26:25,337
Master, this is not fair combat
to pitch knight against bowman.

436
00:26:25,424 --> 00:26:27,858
At this close range, his arrows'll
pierce the armour's weak points.

437
00:26:27,944 --> 00:26:29,821
- Take aim, fellow.
- I am that.

438
00:26:29,904 --> 00:26:32,657
Your freedom if you kill him. Stand back.

439
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:43,101
Your champion'll have more arrows
in his gizzard than a thistle has spikes.

You cut off its head and yet it wriggles.

448
00:27:55,864 --> 00:27:58,424
I'll have a word with Linx about this.

I have a bone to pick with you. Come here!

454
00:28:13,764 --> 00:28:15,720
I am occupied, Irongron.

455
00:28:16,124 --> 00:28:19,321
What! Out this minute or I'll burst the door down.

456
00:28:23,124 --> 00:28:25,797
Well? What is it you need to say to me?

457
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:30,799
Didn't I tell you you might not find my face pleasing?

458
00:28:30,884 --> 00:28:34,035
Aye, and never was truer word spoken.

459

Are they all so fair of face beyond the stars?

The variety of sentient life forms is infinite.

461
00:28:40,924 --> 00:28:44,439
Do you think your primitive features are pleasing to me?

-Well, what is it you want?
-That accursed iron warrior of yours.

You are pleased with it?

464

Some knave with a crossbow shot the control from my hand.

465
00:28:53,244 --> 00:28:55,997
The iron man became crazed, tried to kill all of us.

466
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:59,679
Perhaps the hand control unit itself is a weakness.

467
00:28:59,764 --> 00:29:02,756
I will make you a better warrior, Irongron.

468
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:04,755
One that'll obey your voice perhaps.

469
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:09,156
First, help me kill the one I have now.
It still struggles to slay my knaves.

470

It cannot be killed. It was never alive.

Absolute lunacy.

- Rubeish!
- What? Who is it?

476
00:30:27,644 --> 00:30:29,680
It's me. It's the Doctor. Don't you remember?

477
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:31,516
We were on the same landing at the research centre.

478
00:30:31,604 --> 00:30:34,164
Oh, my dear fellow. So he's got you, too, has he?

479
00:30:34,244 --> 00:30:38,157
No, hardly. Look, Professor,
what's wrong with all these people?

480
00:30:38,244 --> 00:30:41,596
Hypnotised. Can't get a word out of them. Rotten company.

- Well, you seem to be all right.
- Oh, didn't work with me.

00:30:43,564 --> 00:30:45,953
- Strong-minded, you see.
- Yes, and very nearly blind.

483
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,000
Oh, nonsense.

484
00:30:48,084 --> 00:30:50,917
Obviously working some sort of ocular device.

485

Professor, have you any idea where you are?

486
00:30:52,804 --> 00:30:55,113
Some medieval English castle, I suspect.

487
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:57,354
I've been feeling the carvings on some of these columns.

488
00:30:57,444 --> 00:30:58,877
They're astonishingly well preserved.

489
00:30:58,964 --> 00:31:01,876
Yes, you're in a castle all right,
but do you know the time?

490
00:31:01,964 --> 00:31:05,957
About four in the afternoon.
We haven't had breakfast yet, you know.

491
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:08,558
Doesn't feed us much. Once a day if we're lucky.

492
00:31:08,644 --> 00:31:10,441
Now, Professor, listen to me.

493
00:31:10,524 --> 00:31:13,243
This may come as a shock to you so steel yourself.

494
00:31:13,324 --> 00:31:17,033
You have been brought back
to the early years of the Middle Ages.

495
00:31:17,124 --> 00:31:18,682
That's interesting.

496
00:31:18,764 --> 00:31:20,561
I've always maintained that the Loop Theory of Time

497
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:23,238
shouldn't have been so arrogantly dismissed
by Crabshaw and his cronies.

498
00:31:23,324 --> 00:31:24,723
Tell me about it some other time.

499
00:31:24,804 --> 00:31:26,522
We've got to get out of here before Linx comes back.

500
00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:29,164
Not yet, Doctor. This is the opportunity of a lifetime.

501
00:31:29,244 --> 00:31:31,678
There's some most interesting work being done here.

00:31:36,364 --> 00:31:39,322
You go if you want to, Doctor. Go on, but leave me alone.

505
00:31:39,404 --> 00:31:42,282
- Professor, don't you understand?
- Stop!
- 教授，你不明白吗？

00:31:49,964 --> 00:31:52,876
- You are the one called the Doctor?
- You know who I am?

00:31:52,964 --> 00:31:57,355
I have been expecting you. Why did you follow me to this time?

508
00:31:57,444 --> 00:31:59,821
To prevent your interference with the affairs of Earth.

509
00:31:59,904 --> 00:32:01,517
Don't you realise the harm that you'll cause?

510
00:32:01,604 --> 00:32:04,177
This primitive planet and its affairs are of no importance.

511
00:32:04,264 --> 00:32:06,577
That's a typically Sontaran attitude.

512
00:32:06,743 --> 00:32:08,973
Only one thing matters, to complete the repairs to my ship

513
00:32:09,063 --> 00:32:11,861
and return to the glorious war that is my destiny.

514
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:15,697
Nothing must interfere with that, nothing and nobody.

515
00:32:17,442 --> 00:32:19,910
I vouch for her, my lord.
Without her help, I would not be here.

516
00:32:20,002 --> 00:32:22,436
She looks like one I would trust.

517
00:32:22,522 --> 00:32:25,161
Sit, child. Tell us where you're from.

518
00:32:26,002 --> 00:32:28,675
I can't. It's too difficult to explain.

519
00:32:28,802 --> 00:32:32,397
The manner of her dress is strange,
and the manner of her speech.

520
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:35,360
There is much strange at Irongron's castle, Sir Edward.

521
00:32:35,442 --> 00:32:38,161
I told you of the knight that fights on
though it should be dead.

522
00:32:38,242 --> 00:32:41,232
And one of the guards told me
there's a man from the stars that lives among them.

523
00:32:41,262 --> 00:32:43,395
A mighty wizard who makes magic weapons.

524
00:32:43,482 --> 00:32:45,040
A man from the stars.

525
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:47,352
I've heard it said he has the help of devils and magicians.

526
00:32:47,442 --> 00:32:50,832
- It is true, Sir Edward. I have seen it.
- Well, I know who's helping him.

527
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:52,514
- It's the Doctor.
- The doctor?

528
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:55,196
Well, that's what he calls himself,
but he's no magician.

529
00:32:55,282 --> 00:32:58,160
- Just some eccentric scientist.
- What does she say?

530
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:01,518
The words are strange, but I know her meaning.

531
00:33:01,602 --> 00:33:03,991
Who is this doctor? What do you know of him?

532
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,277
Scientists, learned men.

533
00:33:06,362 --> 00:33:09,001
They're being taken from the place I come from,

534
00:33:09,082 --> 00:33:11,300
and I believe that the Doctor is bringing them here

535
00:33:11,382 --> 00:33:12,361
and handing them over to Irongron.

536
00:33:12,442 --> 00:33:14,512
What would Irongron want with these wizards?

537
00:33:14,602 --> 00:33:16,354
To make him magic weapons, my lady.

538
00:33:16,442 --> 00:33:18,319
Irongron thinks only of war and conquest.

539
00:33:18,402 --> 00:33:21,519
Anything that makes Irongron strong can work only to our harm.

540
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:23,832
With an army of magic knights such as I fought,

541
00:33:23,922 --> 00:33:25,913
Irongron could conquer the whole kingdom.

542
00:33:26,002 --> 00:33:28,516
Who knows what other sorceries
he may soon have at his command?

543
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:30,832
I'm sure the Doctor's the key to it all.

544
00:33:30,922 --> 00:33:33,072
He was there when one of the scientists was taken.

545
00:33:33,162 --> 00:33:35,118
He has a machine that can travel through time.

546
00:33:35,202 --> 00:33:38,558
Well, it must be him, and somehow we've got to stop him.

547
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,155
If he's Irongron's ally,

548
00:33:40,242 --> 00:33:42,995
he sits safe within Irongron's walls.
There's nought we can do.

549
00:33:43,082 --> 00:33:46,597
Oh, there's always something you can do.
It's just a matter of working out what.

550
00:33:46,682 --> 00:33:49,594
- A brave speech.
- She has the heart of a lion, sire.

551
00:33:49,682 --> 00:33:51,832
I saw her give Irongron the sharp edge of her tongue.

552
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:55,551
If I had an army of girls such as you,
I might hold this castle forever.

553
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:59,191
As it is, how can I fight Irongron and this doctor?

554
00:33:59,282 --> 00:34:01,876
All right, I'll tell you how.

555
00:34:01,962 --> 00:34:04,032
Now, the first thing we must do is grab the Doctor

556
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:05,635
and get him away from Irongron.

557
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:08,555
And force him to make his magic for me? Aha, good thought.

558
00:34:08,642 --> 00:34:10,200
Aye, but how could it be done?

559
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:13,911
Oh, what's wrong with you?
All it needs is a sort of commando raid.

560
00:34:14,002 --> 00:34:15,799
You knock out the sentries, rush into the castle,

561
00:34:15,882 --> 00:34:17,679
grab the Doctor, and away.

562
00:34:17,762 --> 00:34:20,356
- You've got soldiers, haven't you?
- A handful.
- 你手头有士兵吧，有吗

563
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:22,982
- A raid? A bold plan.
- I'll go, Sir Edward.
- 一个小队？这计划很大胆

564
00:34:26,842 --> 00:34:29,436
You resisted well, Doctor.

565
00:34:29,522 --> 00:34:32,231
I could have increased the power,
but I might have killed you.

566
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:33,514
I need you alive.

567
00:34:33,602 --> 00:34:36,116
A brain of your capacity can be of use to me.

568
00:34:36,202 --> 00:34:37,840
Thank you.

569
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:39,913
You're not of this planet. How came you to be here?

570
00:34:40,002 --> 00:34:42,072
Oh, I'm just a tourist. I like it here.

571
00:34:42,162 --> 00:34:45,791
- This hole in space?
- You haven't seen it at its best.

572
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:49,761
It has no military value, no strategic significance.

573
00:34:49,842 --> 00:34:52,072
Once again, a Sontaran philosophy.

574
00:34:52,162 --> 00:34:55,472
I'm Commander Linx, Fifth Sontaran Army Space Fleet.

575
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:58,759
Ah, yes. Yes, as I thought.

576
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:01,434
A Sontaran warrior.

577
00:35:02,362 --> 00:35:05,991
So, the perpetual war between the Sontarans and the Rutans

578
00:35:06,082 --> 00:35:10,155
- has spread to this tiny planet, has it?
- Emergency landing.
- 已经扩大到这个小星球了，是吗？

579
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:12,392
I was on a reconnaissance mission
when I was attacked

580
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:14,791
by a squadron of Rutan fighters.

581
00:35:16,002 --> 00:35:18,721
You have encountered my race before, Doctor?

582
00:35:18,802 --> 00:35:20,281
Unfortunately.

583
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,915
I'll overlook that insult for the moment.

584
00:35:26,962 --> 00:35:31,513
- What is your native planet?
- Gallifrey. I am a Time Lord.

585
00:35:31,602 --> 00:35:33,558
Ah, yes.

586
00:35:33,642 --> 00:35:36,918
A race of great technical achievement,

587
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:39,470
but lacking the morale to withstand a determined assault.

588
00:35:39,562 --> 00:35:43,555
- Oh, you think so?
- I'm only a lowly commander, Doctor.

589
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:47,317
I merely quote from the appreciation
circulated by our military intelligence.

590
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:48,551
Well, you'd be well advised

591
00:35:48,642 --> 00:35:51,156
never to put that appreciation to the test, Linx.

592
00:35:51,242 --> 00:35:55,997
My only ambition at the moment is to return to my squadron.

593
00:35:56,762 --> 00:36:00,437
You can be of value to me. You can help repair this ship.

594
00:36:00,522 --> 00:36:02,797
You seem to have acquired some help already.

595
00:36:02,882 --> 00:36:06,670
Primitives. I adapted my ship's frequency modulator

596
00:36:06,762 --> 00:36:09,993
and projected myself forward as far as I could.

597
00:36:10,082 --> 00:36:13,438
Unfortunately, I only had the power
to reach the 20th century.

598
00:36:13,522 --> 00:36:14,955
From which you stole the equipment

599
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,760
and the skilled help that you couldn't find here.

600
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:17,911
Yes.

601
00:36:18,882 --> 00:36:20,918
But the work goes slowly.

602
00:36:21,842 --> 00:36:25,039
Commander Linx, if you will return
these people to their own time,

603
00:36:25,122 --> 00:36:26,396
I might possibly consider helping you.

604
00:36:26,482 --> 00:36:29,280
Do not attempt to bargain with me, Doctor!

605
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:33,681
Take that seat there by the controls.

606
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:35,596
Move.

607
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:41,150
You're interfering with human evolution, Linx.

608
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:44,518
Don't you realise the damage
that you're going to do to them?

609
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:47,275
I have no interest in human evolution.

610
00:36:53,602 --> 00:36:56,116
I'm placing you under auto-control, Doctor,

611
00:36:56,202 --> 00:36:58,762
to ensure your complete cooperation.

612
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,834
Human beings must be allowed
to develop at their own pace.

613
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:04,482
At this period, they're just a few steps away from barbarism.

614
00:37:04,562 --> 00:37:09,033
You will monitor progress rates on
the input panel against the programmer.

615
00:37:11,202 --> 00:37:14,114
Now I must leave you in charge for a time.

616
00:37:25,762 --> 00:37:27,320
You give them breech-loading guns now,

617
00:37:27,402 --> 00:37:29,711
they'll have atomic weapons by the 17th century.

618
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,073
They'll have the capability to destroy their own planet

619
00:37:32,161 --> 00:37:33,719
before they're civilised enough to handle it!

620
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,916
You would do well to concentrate
on the task I have given you, Doctor.

621
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,831
Answer the programmer.

622
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,438
I still say this is no work for women.

623
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,919
I wouldn't have missed this for anything.

624
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,072
Anyway, I'm the only one who knows
what the Doctor looks like.

625
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,798
Come on, this way.

626
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,951
Ah, now these are more to my taste
than your iron man, Linx.

627
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,077
I will still perfect the fighting robot
for your army, Irongron.

628
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,798
We'll take these weapons to the men, Bloodaxe,

629
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,519
and I shall instruct them in their use.

630
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,311
Rubeish! Professor, over here quickly.

631
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,358
Is that you, Doctor? I thought you were going.

632
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,838
- A change of plan. I want your help.
- Are you wearing a hat?
- 计划有变，我需要你的帮助

633
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,638
Behind me you'll find a panel. There's a switch on it.

634
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,153
It's dangerous, overheats the brain.

635
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,996
- Panel... Oh, yes, I've got it.
- Right, turn the switch.

636
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,549
I've always thought that's why judges are so peculiar.

637
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,992
It's those wigs they wear.

638
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,149
No! No! That's the wrong... No, no, man!

639
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:38,958
Sorry. I do wish I'd brought my glasses.

640
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,114
Yes, so do I. It was the wrong one.

641
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:43,348
Is this the one?

642
00:38:53,279 --> 00:38:57,033
Yes, that was the one.
Thank you very much indeed, Professor.

643
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,749
- Not at all, Smith.
- Smith. Yes, of course.

644
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,228
Will you excuse me? I've got to go and find a young girl.

645
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:06,355
I'll see you later, I hope.

646
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,472
Young girl? I should've thought
he was a bit old for that sort of thing.

647
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,628
Oh, well.

648
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,716
Ah, good evening.

649
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:22,794
Get after him! Call the guards!

650
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:24,835
(SHOUTING)

651
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:28,711
Catch him!

652
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:40,077
(SHOUTING)

653
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,468
Grab him! Grab him!

654
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:54,515
(SHOUTING)

655
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,868
He who strikes Irongron dies!

656
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:06,100
Doctor! Up here!

657
00:40:29,747 --> 00:40:31,658
Thank you very much, Miss Smith. A most timely rescue.

658
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:33,942
This isn't a rescue, Doctor, it's a capture.

659
00:40:34,027 --> 00:40:35,619
Let's get him out of here.

660
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,486
That fellow has the gall of a camel and the cunning of a fox!

661
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:19,321
You shall have your revenge, Captain.
He'll be with Sir Edward now.

662
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:21,875
And not even a rat will come out of that castle alive tomorrow.

663
00:41:21,967 --> 00:41:24,925
By the stars, Bloodaxe, I swear I'll chop him up so fine

664
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:28,238
not even a sparrow will fill its beak at one peck!

665
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:32,627
One of my workers has disappeared.

666
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:34,379
Order a search of your castle.

667
00:41:34,467 --> 00:41:36,981
If you've lost one of your dumb, whey-faced ninnies, Linx,

668
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:39,785
then look for him yourself. My men are at rest.

669
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:41,779
We march on Sir Edward within the hour.

670
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:46,816
I insist upon a search, Irongron.
The Doctor is of great value to me.

671
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:49,216
And while he is at large, he could be dangerous.

672
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:50,342
The Doctor?

673
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:54,579
Bother me now, little toad,
and you will feel an axe in your skull!

674
00:41:54,707 --> 00:41:59,462
Master, I heard someone call ''Doctor''
while we were at that fellow's heels.

675
00:41:59,547 --> 00:42:03,017
Is this Doctor a long shank rascal with a mighty nose?

676
00:42:03,107 --> 00:42:05,223
That is how he would appear in human eyes.

677
00:42:05,307 --> 00:42:07,377
Then he is no longer here.

678
00:42:08,107 --> 00:42:10,826
Sir Edward sent raiders to my castle,
captured him.

679
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,545
He has escaped!

680
00:42:13,147 --> 00:42:15,342
- Tell Sir Edward we're back.
- Yes.

681
00:42:15,427 --> 00:42:18,305
- Now...
- You've been getting around, Sarah.

682
00:42:18,387 --> 00:42:21,060
Are you on visiting terms with all the local nobility?

683
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:24,025
Doctor, let's get a few things straight, shall we?

684
00:42:24,147 --> 00:42:27,105
Oh, dear. I'm afraid you're going to be awfully confused

685
00:42:27,187 --> 00:42:29,496
if you ask me to explain about the Tardis.

686
00:42:29,587 --> 00:42:32,181
- The Tardis?
- Yes, my police box.

687
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:34,098
You were a stowaway, I imagine.

688
00:42:34,187 --> 00:42:36,257
Yes, but we'll come to that later.

689
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:40,863
- Now then, why are you helping Irongron?
- My dear girl, I'm not helping him.
- 现在说说，你为什么要帮 Irongron？

690
00:42:41,587 --> 00:42:44,055
Linx is. I'm trying to stop him.

691
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:45,375
SARAH: Linx?

692
00:42:45,467 --> 00:42:48,140
Yes, perhaps you're lucky enough not to have met him yet.

693
00:42:48,227 --> 00:42:51,185
Nasty, brutish and short just about sums him up.

694
00:42:52,067 --> 00:42:54,501
There was a strange-looking knight with Irongron.

695
00:42:54,587 --> 00:42:58,102
Yes, he'd have looked even stranger
if he hadn't been wearing space armour.

696
00:42:58,107 --> 00:43:01,502
He comes from a planet
where the surface gravity is many times that of Earth.

697
00:43:01,587 --> 00:43:03,703
- A man from the stars?
- Mmm-hmm.

698
00:43:03,787 --> 00:43:07,257
- How do I know you're telling the truth?
- Because I never lie.

699
00:43:07,347 --> 00:43:09,303
Well, hardly ever.

700
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:12,498
You ever heard of UNIT?

701
00:43:12,587 --> 00:43:14,259
You work for UNIT?

702
00:43:14,347 --> 00:43:16,656
In an advisory capacity, yes.

703
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:20,545
They asked me to look into this question
of the missing scientists for them.

704
00:43:20,627 --> 00:43:22,140
But I thought you were responsible for that.

705
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:25,185
My dear girl, I don't go round kidnapping scientists!

706
00:43:25,267 --> 00:43:27,622
No, Linx brought them here to staff his workshop.

707
00:43:27,707 --> 00:43:29,937
Now I've got to find a way of
sending them back to their own time.

708
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:33,542
- This is the magician?
- Yes. This is the Doctor.

709
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:36,025
You have done well, Sarah.

710
00:43:37,267 --> 00:43:38,376
How do you do?

711
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:42,022
It is a pleasure and a privilege
to be in the company of civilised people at last.

712
00:43:42,107 --> 00:43:43,222
A courtly rogue.

713
00:43:43,307 --> 00:43:47,263
Is he willing to change his allegiance
and serve Sir Edward instead of Irongron?

714
00:43:47,507 --> 00:43:49,418
Well, he says he wasn't serving Irongron.

715
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:52,260
And there is another stranger at the castle,
someone called Linx.

716
00:43:52,347 --> 00:43:54,542
Yes, he's your enemy, I assure you,
not me.

717
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:57,141
We'd be well advised to join forces against him.

718
00:43:57,227 --> 00:43:59,616
- Does he speak truth?
- I'm not sure.

719
00:43:59,707 --> 00:44:01,584
I suppose I could have been wrong.

720
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,146
That's a generous admission.

721
00:44:03,227 --> 00:44:05,058
Especially coming from one of the fair sex.

722
00:44:05,147 --> 00:44:07,615
Or he could just be changing sides to save his own skin.

723
00:44:07,707 --> 00:44:10,744
These wizards and warlocks were ever a treacherous breed.

724
00:44:10,827 --> 00:44:12,818
We'd best be wary of him.

725
00:44:13,587 --> 00:44:14,815
I shall spare your life

726
00:44:14,907 --> 00:44:18,900
if you cast your spells and incantations
to help me against Irongron, Doctor.

727
00:44:18,987 --> 00:44:20,818
Refuse and you die.

728
00:44:21,947 --> 00:44:24,461
You offer a somewhat restricted choice, Sir Edward.

729
00:44:24,547 --> 00:44:26,697
EDWARD: What is your answer?

730
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:30,186
My services are at your disposal, sir.

731
00:44:31,307 --> 00:44:33,104
- Such as they are.
- Good.

732
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:36,340
Serve me straight, Doctor, and I shall reward you well.

733
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:39,857
Oh, master... Oh, but, master,
Irongron marches here before noon!

734
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:41,665
We heard this said from his own mouth.

735
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:45,057
Then we are lost. We cannot stand against them.

736
00:44:45,147 --> 00:44:47,900
- On the contrary, sir, I think we can.
- But how? With a handful of men?

737
00:44:47,987 --> 00:44:52,055
Yes, sir, with just a few men I think
I can persuade Irongron that we have a full garrison.

738
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,945
By the use of your magic?

739
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:56,745
By creating an illusion, anyway.

740
00:44:56,827 --> 00:45:00,820
Your magic will have to be powerful
indeed to discourage Irongron.

741
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,579
It will be, sir.

742
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:06,459
- The men are ready, Captain.
- Good.

743
00:45:06,547 --> 00:45:08,378
Though for such an easy conquest as this,

744
00:45:08,467 --> 00:45:11,061
'tis scarce worth strapping on armour!

745
00:45:11,147 --> 00:45:13,581
You and I alone, good Bloodaxe, could take that castle!

746
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,100
Indeed we could, Captain.

747
00:45:15,187 --> 00:45:17,143
With Sir Edward's treasure I shall hire more men,

748
00:45:17,227 --> 00:45:20,981
and with Linx's weapons to arm them,
who shall stand against us?

749
00:45:21,107 --> 00:45:23,143
When does the fighting start, Irongron?

750
00:45:23,227 --> 00:45:25,980
In the time it takes to ride from here to Sir Edward's castle.

751
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:28,535
- Then I shall come with you.
- What, you?

752
00:45:28,627 --> 00:45:32,745
Ha! Bloodaxe, on my oath,
can you see that on a scaling ladder?

753
00:45:33,627 --> 00:45:35,697
I have an interest in seeing the battle.

754
00:45:35,787 --> 00:45:38,506
Those eyes have a thirst for blood.

755
00:45:38,587 --> 00:45:41,784
Well, find our bold warrior a horse, Bloodaxe.

756
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,420
Come, then!

757
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:51,862
- Here's a few more for you, Doctor.
- Thank you, Sarah.

758
00:45:51,947 --> 00:45:55,462
Lady Eleanor's got every serving wench
in the castle sewing away like mad.

759
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:57,902
I told you there'd be plenty of work
for everybody, didn't I?

760
00:45:57,987 --> 00:46:00,342
Oh. Typically masculine arrangement, though.

761
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:02,736
We do all the dirty work, you get all the fun.

762
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:06,263
You don't think mixing this singularly noxious compound is fun, do you?

763
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,702
- How's the rest of it going?
- Not bad.

764
00:46:08,787 --> 00:46:11,506
I put Sir Edward in charge of painting the dummies' faces.

765
00:46:11,587 --> 00:46:13,543
He's turned out to be quite an artist.

766
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:16,465
- Once I'd set him on the right lines.
- Excellent.

767
00:46:16,587 --> 00:46:19,738
- I'm glad I decided to let you stay.
- You decided?

768
00:46:20,347 --> 00:46:22,781
You know, I was never much of a hand
with a paint brush myself.

769
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:24,903
- No?
- No.

770
00:46:25,347 --> 00:46:27,303
Nor a palette knife for that matter.

771
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:29,503
I'd like to study under one of the masters one day.

772
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:31,384
Rembrandt, preferably.

773
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:33,059
- Rembrandt!
- Mmm-hmm.

774
00:46:33,147 --> 00:46:36,105
Can you... Can you just go anywhere
you like in that Tardis?

775
00:46:36,187 --> 00:46:37,256
Yes, within reason.

776
00:46:37,347 --> 00:46:39,781
Then why are you staying here?
Why don't you go somewhere safer?

777
00:46:39,867 --> 00:46:42,859
Because, my dear Sarah, I've got a job to do.

778
00:46:42,947 --> 00:46:45,745
One that involves the whole future of your species.

779
00:46:46,427 --> 00:46:48,497
Here, hold this will you?

780
00:46:48,587 --> 00:46:50,305
- My species?
- Mmm-hmm.

781
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:52,696
You're talking as if you weren't human.

782
00:46:52,787 --> 00:46:54,300
Well, the definition of the word ''humanity''

783
00:46:54,387 --> 00:46:56,503
was always rather a complex question, wasn't it?

784
00:46:56,587 --> 00:47:00,023
You know perfectly well what I mean.
Are you or aren't you?

785
00:47:00,107 --> 00:47:02,098
If you mean am I a native of the planet Terra,

786
00:47:02,187 --> 00:47:03,620
the answer is no, I'm not.

787
00:47:03,707 --> 00:47:06,016
- Well, what are you, then?
- Me? I'm a Time Lord.

788
00:47:06,467 --> 00:47:09,186
- A Time Lord?
- Yes, that's right.

789
00:47:09,267 --> 00:47:13,021
And my people are very keen
to stamp out unlicensed time travel.

790
00:47:13,307 --> 00:47:17,380
You can look upon them as
galactic ticket inspectors if you like.

791
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,935
- Galactic ticket inspectors?
- Mmm-hmm.

792
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:24,381
I could murder a cup of tea. You're serious, aren't you?

793
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:27,903
About what I do, yes. Not necessarily the way I do it.

794
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:39,345
That's made them stop and think, anyway.

795
00:47:41,027 --> 00:47:42,301
They've got guns!

796
00:47:42,707 --> 00:47:45,221
No man has fallen, Captain!

797
00:47:45,307 --> 00:47:49,346
- Your weapons do not work, Linx!
- You do not shoot them straight!

798
00:47:49,427 --> 00:47:50,906
Watch.

799
00:47:58,227 --> 00:48:01,503
- LINX: Those figures are dummies.
- Bah, your weapons are useless!
- 那些是假人

800
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:05,546
They do not move nor fall. They are not living men.

801
00:48:06,147 --> 00:48:09,105
IRONGRON: I smell that fox of a Doctor behind this.

802
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,617
Bring up the scaling ladders!

803
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,780
Here they come, Doctor!

804
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:22,264
(MEN YELLING)

805
00:49:04,647 --> 00:49:06,046
Away! Away!

806
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:09,157
Come on, move it!

807
00:49:10,267 --> 00:49:13,737
What was that stuff, Doctor? Some kind of gas?

808
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:15,101
Gas?

809
00:49:15,187 --> 00:49:17,542
Good heavens, what on earth do you take me for?

810
00:49:17,627 --> 00:49:19,583
No, it was some sort of superior stink bomb

811
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:22,386
with a few bangs and flashes thrown in for good measure.

812
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:24,856
It's quite harmless, I assure you, but...

813
00:49:24,947 --> 00:49:26,619
(SNIFFING)

814
00:49:29,347 --> 00:49:31,065
(MEN COUGHING)

815
00:49:31,627 --> 00:49:33,697
Bring me wine! Wine, I say!

816
00:49:33,787 --> 00:49:37,666
To quench the dust from my throat
and the stench from my nostrils.

817
00:49:39,827 --> 00:49:41,658
More, wench, more!

818
00:49:41,747 --> 00:49:45,137
Am I a sparrow to quench my thirst
with a few scant drops?

819
00:49:45,587 --> 00:49:48,579
Ooh, mice!

820
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:54,658
A few loud noises, a few bad smells
and you scatter like sheep!

821
00:49:54,787 --> 00:49:56,778
It was sorcery, master.

822
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:59,142
Black devil's work. You said so yourself.

823
00:49:59,227 --> 00:50:01,536
This wizard, the Doctor, he's gone and joined Sir Edward,

824
00:50:01,627 --> 00:50:04,744
and he threw all the fires and the stenches of hell itself at us!

825
00:50:04,827 --> 00:50:06,385
With poltroons like these,

826
00:50:06,467 --> 00:50:08,856
it were ill work to lay siege to a hen coop!

827
00:50:08,947 --> 00:50:12,064
They do but need food and rest to recover their spirits, Captain.

828
00:50:12,147 --> 00:50:14,058
We attack again tomorrow morning.

829
00:50:14,147 --> 00:50:15,705
I will take Sir Edward's castle

830
00:50:15,787 --> 00:50:19,097
or I will see every man of you perish in the attempt!

831
00:50:19,987 --> 00:50:21,943
Chicken-hearted knaves!

832
00:50:22,507 --> 00:50:24,384
Begone from my sight!

833
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:33,100
Did I not see you yourself leading their retreat, Captain?

834
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:37,306
Taunt me not, little toad face.

835
00:50:37,387 --> 00:50:41,903
Or by the stars I'll see if the colour
of your blood is red like mortal man's.

836
00:50:41,987 --> 00:50:44,455
You Earth creatures give up too easily.

837
00:50:44,547 --> 00:50:47,744
I doubt if you have the potential
to make a truly military species.

838
00:50:47,827 --> 00:50:51,297
And you, Linx, you claim to like war.

839
00:50:51,387 --> 00:50:55,505
- I haven't seen you doing much this day.
- I came only to observe.

840
00:50:56,387 --> 00:51:00,078
I should have known better than
to look for interest in a struggle of primitives

841
00:51:00,147 --> 00:51:02,945
Threaten me once more and I will destroy you.

842
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:04,619
Why, you...

843
00:51:07,587 --> 00:51:10,863
Primitives! Childish, squabbling primitives!

844
00:51:11,907 --> 00:51:15,866
It is well I do not need to spend much more time among you.

845
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,585
(ALL LAUGHING)

846
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:32,495
EDWARD: More wine, Doctor?

847
00:51:32,587 --> 00:51:35,385
No, thank you, no. Oh, well, just perhaps a little.

848
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,823
Those knaves of Irongron's, they ran like rabbits!

849
00:51:41,227 --> 00:51:45,266
Finest sight that ever I saw, Doctor.
And all thanks to you and your wizardry.

850
00:51:45,347 --> 00:51:47,303
Well, we all played our part, Sir Edward.

851
00:51:47,387 --> 00:51:50,026
Now your magic works for us, our troubles are over.

852
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,222
No, not quite, I'm afraid.

853
00:51:51,307 --> 00:51:53,901
The Doctor thinks Irongron's bound to attack again.

854
00:51:53,987 --> 00:51:56,706
And you shall affright the knaves with more of your sorceries.

855
00:51:56,787 --> 00:51:58,664
It won't work indefinitely, I fear.

856
00:51:58,747 --> 00:52:00,419
This time we had the element of surprise.

857
00:52:00,507 --> 00:52:02,941
They won't be frightened off quite so easily again.

858
00:52:03,027 --> 00:52:05,905
Then we've gained a respite. No more.

859
00:52:05,987 --> 00:52:08,057
Actually, the Doctor does have another idea.

860
00:52:08,147 --> 00:52:11,981
Then let us hear your counsel, Doctor.
So far you have served us well.

861
00:52:12,067 --> 00:52:15,343
Well, there's one sure way to prevent Irongron
from capturing your castle.

862
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:17,145
And that is?

863
00:52:17,227 --> 00:52:18,501
You must capture his.

864
00:52:18,587 --> 00:52:19,781
(SCOFFS)

865
00:52:19,867 --> 00:52:22,859
You advise the impossible, Doctor.
They outnumber us so greatly.

866
00:52:22,947 --> 00:52:26,417
My lady, are you familiar with these herbs and simples?

867
00:52:27,427 --> 00:52:30,817
Ragwort, henbane, love-in-a-mist, fennel, sesame.

868
00:52:30,907 --> 00:52:34,183
Most we have dried in the kitchens.
The rest grow in the woods nearby.

869
00:52:34,267 --> 00:52:36,827
Excellent. I want to brew up a little draught.

870
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:40,263
You mean to mix a magic potion to slay the dog?

871
00:52:40,347 --> 00:52:43,896
No, not quite. Just something
to calm him down a little.

872
00:52:44,987 --> 00:52:48,821
I should have slain the filthy little toad there and then.

873
00:52:48,907 --> 00:52:51,819
I should have carved him up
into callops on the spot.

874
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:55,058
Aye, master, it puzzles me
as to why you did not.

875
00:52:56,587 --> 00:53:00,865
Aye, well 'tis a matter of high policy, do you see?

876
00:53:01,467 --> 00:53:04,539
Above your understanding, hmm?

877
00:53:06,387 --> 00:53:09,902
As yet, we still need Linx's aid.

878
00:53:10,707 --> 00:53:16,065
Weapons he has promised me and by the stars,
weapons I shall have.

879
00:53:17,147 --> 00:53:19,422
Wonderful, magical weapons,

880
00:53:19,507 --> 00:53:23,420
that will crumble the castles of those that oppose me into dust.

881
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:29,785
And then, and only then,
shall Linx die by my hand!

882
00:53:32,147 --> 00:53:34,183
Oh, 'tis a cunning plan, Captain.

883
00:53:34,307 --> 00:53:38,266
Aye, 'tis as well for you dolts that you have me to guide you.

884
00:53:38,347 --> 00:53:39,416
(CHUCKLES)

885
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:42,817
There's more to war than hard strokes, my good Bloodaxe.

886
00:53:42,907 --> 00:53:44,738
Aye, master.

887
00:53:44,827 --> 00:53:48,297
Yours is indeed a towering intelligence.

888
00:53:55,627 --> 00:53:57,857
Hold, Friar. What business have you here?

889
00:53:57,947 --> 00:54:01,098
We come to beg alms of the good Captain Irongron.

890
00:54:01,227 --> 00:54:04,264
The fame of his charity is spread far and wide.

891
00:54:05,347 --> 00:54:07,542
You will find Captain Irongron in the great hall.

892
00:54:07,627 --> 00:54:09,936
He is indeed a kindly and charitable man

893
00:54:10,027 --> 00:54:12,541
and his temper is most sweet and pleasant.

894
00:54:13,507 --> 00:54:14,701
Pass, Friar.

895
00:54:14,787 --> 00:54:17,381
Heaven will reward you, my son. Come, brother.

896
00:54:19,267 --> 00:54:20,336
(CHUCKLES)

897
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:22,702
'Tis to be hoped the two friars are fleet of foot,

898
00:54:22,787 --> 00:54:24,947
or the church will have two new martyrs ere long.

899
00:54:25,267 --> 00:54:26,985
(DOOR RATTLING)

900
00:54:32,867 --> 00:54:34,220
What's that?

901
00:54:34,307 --> 00:54:36,537
That's a Sontaran spaceship, to be precise,

902
00:54:36,667 --> 00:54:39,625
and tremendously powerful for its size,
just like its owner.

903
00:54:39,707 --> 00:54:41,698
Here, give me your habit.

904
00:54:47,627 --> 00:54:50,061
- What's wrong with him?
- Deep hypnosis.

905
00:54:50,147 --> 00:54:52,297
Ah, there you are, Doctor! Back again, eh?

906
00:54:52,387 --> 00:54:55,504
- SARAH: Professor Rubeish!
- What?

907
00:54:55,587 --> 00:54:56,861
Oh, it's you!

908
00:54:56,947 --> 00:55:00,178
Doctor, I knew this girl was involved.
We should have reported her as I wanted.

909
00:55:00,267 --> 00:55:02,701
Yes, well, I'm very glad we didn't.

910
00:55:02,787 --> 00:55:04,743
In a few hours, that ship's going to be ready for takeoff.

911
00:55:04,827 --> 00:55:09,105
Yes, he's been working these people at a killing pace.
Come over here.

912
00:55:09,627 --> 00:55:10,696
Look.

913
00:55:10,787 --> 00:55:14,621
No sleep. Practically no food.
They're starting to collapse like flies.

914
00:55:14,707 --> 00:55:16,698
I'm not surprised. He's suffering from near starvation.

915
00:55:16,787 --> 00:55:19,301
We'll have to get them some food, Doctor,
or at least a drink.

916
00:55:19,387 --> 00:55:21,343
- There's no time for that.
- They'll die if we don't.

917
00:55:21,427 --> 00:55:23,179
Sarah, listen to me.

918
00:55:23,827 --> 00:55:26,819
Linx's spaceship is just about ready for takeoff.

919
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:29,979
And when that happens, there's going
to be the most tremendous explosion.

920
00:55:30,067 --> 00:55:32,058
Everybody in this castle will die.

921
00:55:33,867 --> 00:55:36,301
These are the weapons I have promised you.

922
00:55:36,387 --> 00:55:39,618
Also a good supply of the projectiles that they use.

923
00:55:39,707 --> 00:55:44,223
Oh, my thanks, good toad face... Good Linx.

924
00:55:45,787 --> 00:55:47,664
More weapons from the stars.

925
00:55:47,747 --> 00:55:51,057
I shall complete the repairs of the improved fighting robot

926
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:52,819
if I have time before I leave.

927
00:55:52,907 --> 00:55:55,705
If you wish to leave, then you would do well to obey me.

928
00:55:55,787 --> 00:55:58,255
Do you threaten me?

929
00:55:58,347 --> 00:56:00,622
I leave when I am ready, and that will be soon.

930
00:56:00,707 --> 00:56:04,302
And will you carry your starship on your back, good toad?

931
00:56:04,707 --> 00:56:08,905
You needed my knaves to bring it here,
you will need them to take it hence.

932
00:56:08,987 --> 00:56:10,864
Evidently you have no understanding

933
00:56:10,947 --> 00:56:13,507
of the forces involved in interstellar travel.

934
00:56:14,347 --> 00:56:15,826
I shall leave when I am ready.

935
00:56:15,907 --> 00:56:19,024
It would be foolish of you to attempt to stop me.

936
00:56:22,027 --> 00:56:23,619
Doctor, what are you doing?

937
00:56:23,707 --> 00:56:25,937
- Trying to break this hypnosis.
- It's very deep.

938
00:56:26,027 --> 00:56:27,858
Narcoleptic condition, eh?

939
00:56:27,947 --> 00:56:30,519
The brain can still receive signals, Professor.

940
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,539
Why can't you just send them as they are?

941
00:56:32,627 --> 00:56:34,663
It's too risky with their minds in this state.

942
00:56:34,747 --> 00:56:36,465
The transition might damage them permanently.

943
00:56:36,547 --> 00:56:38,299
I've never heard so much gobbledegook in me life.

944
00:56:38,387 --> 00:56:40,025
But I expect you know what you're talking about.

945
00:56:40,107 --> 00:56:41,335
- Polka time!
- BOTH: What?

946
00:56:41,427 --> 00:56:44,783
It's the beat. Look, he's beginning to respond.

947
00:56:45,227 --> 00:56:46,546
Hide!

948
00:56:59,627 --> 00:57:00,901
Up!

949
00:57:02,707 --> 00:57:04,504
Get back to work!

950
00:57:08,147 --> 00:57:10,502
Work! What's wrong with you?

951
00:57:12,107 --> 00:57:13,779
Get up or I will kill you!

952
00:57:13,867 --> 00:57:15,937
- Leave him, Linx!
- Ah!

953
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:19,985
How fortunate that you have returned, Doctor.

954
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:21,386
My failure to destroy you

955
00:57:21,467 --> 00:57:23,344
was the one thing that marred the pleasure

956
00:57:23,427 --> 00:57:26,499
of my approaching departure from this miserable planet.

957
00:57:26,587 --> 00:57:28,225
Don't you want to know why I've returned?

958
00:57:28,307 --> 00:57:29,820
It is of no interest to me.

959
00:57:29,907 --> 00:57:31,545
I came here to offer you my help.

960
00:57:31,627 --> 00:57:33,857
We're sworn enemies, Doctor. Why should you help me?

961
00:57:33,947 --> 00:57:36,097
Because I want something from you.

962
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,984
If you will let me de-hypnotise people
and send them home

963
00:57:40,067 --> 00:57:43,025
and help me capture Irongron and his men,

964
00:57:43,107 --> 00:57:46,577
then I will assist you in the repairs to your spaceship.

965
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:48,180
Now, the weapons that you've made for Irongron

966
00:57:48,267 --> 00:57:50,064
you can leave here in the castle.

967
00:57:50,147 --> 00:57:51,660
When it's empty, you can take off,

968
00:57:51,747 --> 00:57:54,784
destroying castle and weapons at the same time.

969
00:57:54,867 --> 00:57:56,186
All right, Commander Linx,

970
00:57:57,186 --> 00:57:58,460
what do you say?

971
00:57:58,546 --> 00:58:01,458
- You wish for my answer, Doctor?
- I do.

972
00:58:01,946 --> 00:58:03,538
Then here it is.

973
00:58:02,086 --> 00:58:03,678
Then here it is.

974
00:58:07,005 --> 00:58:08,882
SARAH: No!

975
00:58:11,485 --> 00:58:15,558
The female, too. It seems I am doubly fortunate.

976
00:58:17,005 --> 00:58:19,758
- Get up. Get back to work!
- DOCTOR: Linx.

977
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:24,840
Can't you see that your prisoners
are physically exhausted?

978
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:27,241
They've had no sleep and nothing to eat for days.

979
00:58:27,325 --> 00:58:29,793
- They can still work!
- Not for much longer.

980
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:32,240
LINX: I owe these primitives nothing.

981
00:58:32,325 --> 00:58:36,284
My only concern is to rejoin our glorious struggle for freedom.

982
00:58:36,365 --> 00:58:38,754
DOCTOR: That's such an old tune.

983
00:58:38,845 --> 00:58:41,234
Don't you know there's no such thing
as the super race?

984
00:58:41,325 --> 00:58:44,840
Your Time Lord philosophy is egalitarian twaddle.

985
00:58:44,925 --> 00:58:46,643
It is a weakness.

986
00:58:46,725 --> 00:58:49,478
Every species has its own weakness, Linx.

987
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:54,603
For instance, you can only be stunned
by a blow on the probic vent,

988
00:58:55,005 --> 00:58:57,678
that small hole at the back of your neck.

989
00:58:57,765 --> 00:58:59,596
LINX: In our case, Doctor, it is a strength,

990
00:58:59,685 --> 00:59:02,438
because it means we must always face our enemies.

991
00:59:02,525 --> 00:59:05,835
Now, to return to the question of your demise.

992
00:59:05,925 --> 00:59:07,483
I think it would be better

993
00:59:07,565 --> 00:59:12,241
if you witnessed first the destruction
of your female companion.

994
00:59:17,725 --> 00:59:19,443
Well done, Rubeish.

995
00:59:19,845 --> 00:59:23,155
- Doctor, are you all right?
- Yes.

996
00:59:24,245 --> 00:59:26,679
Yes. The blast was too brief.

997
00:59:26,765 --> 00:59:28,517
But I wouldn't have been in a few moments.

998
00:59:28,605 --> 00:59:31,483
- Thank you very much, Sarah.
- Oh, pleasure.

999
00:59:34,005 --> 00:59:36,041
Hadn't I better be getting on with the rest of your plan?

1000
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:39,401
- Yes. All right, but be careful.
- You, too, Doctor.

1001
00:59:41,525 --> 00:59:44,756
Right. Well, if we can secure our friend here,

1002
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:48,723
we can get on with the job of restoring
his wretched victims.

1003
00:59:48,805 --> 00:59:50,557
Will this help?

1004
00:59:50,645 --> 00:59:53,113
Rubeish, you're invaluable, my dear chap.

1005
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,597
- Bloodaxe.
- Captain.

1006
00:59:57,685 --> 00:59:59,277
Fetch me Linx.

1007
00:59:59,365 --> 01:00:02,323
Fetch me that scabby-faced stoat from his burrow.

1008
01:00:02,405 --> 01:00:04,043
At once, Captain.

1009
01:00:11,245 --> 01:00:13,361
Well, that should hold him for a while,
even on this planet.

1010
01:00:13,445 --> 01:00:14,594
Why this planet?

1011
01:00:14,685 --> 01:00:17,802
Well, in his own environment, he weighs several tons.

1012
01:00:17,885 --> 01:00:21,240
Fortunately, his muscles have been designed
for load bearing rather than leverage

1013
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:22,714
Fascinating.

1014
01:00:22,805 --> 01:00:25,273
I'd always assumed that creatures
from a high-density planet

1015
01:00:25,365 --> 01:00:27,833
would have developed a pressure-balanced physiology.

1016
01:00:27,925 --> 01:00:29,756
For example, if you take certain types of seaweed...

1017
01:00:29,845 --> 01:00:32,962
BLOODAXE: Linx! Linx!

1018
01:00:38,325 --> 01:00:40,156
-Linx?
-DOCTOR: Who speaks?

1019
01:00:40,245 --> 01:00:42,395
Captain Irongron commands your presence.

1020
01:00:42,485 --> 01:00:44,396
Tell him I'm busy.

1021
01:00:44,485 --> 01:00:47,363
Well, come soon or we come and fetch you.

1022
01:00:51,485 --> 01:00:53,680
Who is Irongron? Is he a nice chap?

1023
01:00:53,765 --> 01:00:56,518
Well, I wouldn't recommend him
for the Royal Society.

1024
01:00:56,605 --> 01:00:58,994
All right, Rubeish, you know how
to bring these people round?

1025
01:00:59,085 --> 01:01:00,757
- Yes. A simple, repetitive optical...
- Yes, quite so.
- 是，很简单，一直进行光学的...

1026
01:01:00,845 --> 01:01:02,881
- I'll leave you to get on with it.
- What do you propose to do?
- 我就把这个事情留给你了

1027
01:01:02,965 --> 01:01:05,240
I was going to preset this osmic projector.

1028
01:01:05,325 --> 01:01:07,634
Send these people back to their own time.

1029
01:01:07,725 --> 01:01:11,115
But now I have to find a way of stalling Irongron.

1030
01:01:15,445 --> 01:01:18,562
The robot! Yes, of course.

1031
01:01:38,925 --> 01:01:40,358
Thief!

1032
01:01:40,565 --> 01:01:43,284
You common scullion, stand aside!

1033
01:01:43,885 --> 01:01:47,355
How dare you obstruct me?
I shall have you flogged.

1034
01:01:47,445 --> 01:01:50,005
Oh, so, a lady, are you?

1035
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:52,804
- A lady dressed as a serving wench?
- I'm hungry.
- 一位小姐穿得跟个侍女一样？

1036
01:01:52,885 --> 01:01:56,673
Please let me go. I've tasted neither
bread nor meat for nearly a month.

1037
01:01:58,845 --> 01:02:02,724
No, nor done no work for longer
by the look of you.

1038
01:02:02,805 --> 01:02:05,319
All right, my girl, I'll give you bread and cheese,

1039
01:02:05,405 --> 01:02:06,679
but you'll have to earn it.

1040
01:02:10,805 --> 01:02:12,477
Who are you?

1041
01:02:12,565 --> 01:02:16,877
DOCTOR: I am a gift to Captain Irongron

1042
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:21,402
from the one who made me, my master, Commander Linx.

1043
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:26,637
It is indeed the robot, Bloodaxe, though somewhat different in shape.

1044
01:02:27,085 --> 01:02:30,361
And I remember, Linx promised
to make me a second iron man,

1045
01:02:30,445 --> 01:02:32,640
one that would obey my voice.

1046
01:02:33,685 --> 01:02:35,721
But why has Linx sent you?

1047
01:02:35,805 --> 01:02:38,080
Why has he not himself obeyed my summons?

1048
01:02:38,165 --> 01:02:43,285
My master toils in his workshop to make you more fighting robots.

1049
01:02:44,005 --> 01:02:47,236
- He sent me as proof of his goodwill.
- What?

1050
01:02:47,765 --> 01:02:51,678
- Now I must return.
- Hold.

1051
01:02:54,325 --> 01:02:57,715
I would see something of the mettle of this gift.

1052
01:02:57,805 --> 01:03:00,797
- Can you fight, iron man?
- That is my purpose.

1053
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,281
Then fight me.

1054
01:03:04,365 --> 01:03:08,153
I was programmed to fight for you,
not against you.

1055
01:03:08,245 --> 01:03:11,999
- Cease thy gabble and fight.
- You will damage my circuits.

1056
01:03:12,085 --> 01:03:13,677
Fight, iron man,

1057
01:03:13,805 --> 01:03:17,718
or you'll return to Linx in as
many pieces as did your brother.

Hold, I say!

1065
01:03:43,485 --> 01:03:46,636
We must slow this iron man's speed a little.

1066
01:03:46,725 --> 01:03:49,637
Stick me some crossbow bolts in the creature.

1067
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:53,320
We'll see if it fights as well with
a crossbow bolt or two in its gizzard.

1068
01:03:53,405 --> 01:03:54,804
And if that fails,

1069
01:03:54,885 --> 01:03:56,955
we'll lop off its head and try again then.

- I cannot reveal my face, Irongron.
- 抬起你的面具

Why?

1076
01:04:12,325 --> 01:04:15,317
Because if I did, it might give you a seizure.

- Well, I did warn you, didn't I?

There's a machine here that'll send you home again.

Unfortunately, I don't know how to work it,

1087
01:05:15,405 --> 01:05:16,724
and the chap who does has vanished.

1088
01:05:16,805 --> 01:05:18,955
But I expect he'll pop up again.
He usually does.

until then, you must carry on working
as if you were still hypnotised.

- Morrison, don't start asking a lot of awkward questions

Oh, there you are, you dragon-eyed toad.

- The Doctor.

why don't you get on with it?

- Well, I can try.

1172
01:11:31,784 --> 01:11:33,217
Suppose you don't succeed?

1173
01:11:33,304 --> 01:11:35,374
Then we've got between five and ten
minutes to get out of here

1174
01:11:35,464 --> 01:11:37,295
before we're all blown to kingdom come.

1175
01:11:40,704 --> 01:11:42,934
(MAN SNORING)

1176
01:11:51,864 --> 01:11:54,856
- Couldn't you shut it down?
- No, the drive system is sealed.

1177
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:58,459
Linx must have taken the activator key.
I managed to get a hold of this, though.

1178
01:11:58,544 --> 01:12:01,297
I was lucky to get it out with the drive running.

1179
01:12:01,384 --> 01:12:02,703
I think that should do it.

1180
01:12:02,784 --> 01:12:04,376
I've got to send them back one at a time.

1181
01:12:04,464 --> 01:12:06,102
Get the first one to stand over there,
will you, Rubeish?

1182
01:12:06,184 --> 01:12:07,856
Come on, Morrison.

1183
01:12:08,864 --> 01:12:12,015
All right, Rubeish, come over here.
I may want you to take over.

1184
01:12:12,104 --> 01:12:14,459
Now then, all you have to do is this,

1185
01:12:14,544 --> 01:12:17,217
- this and this. Get it?
- Yeah.

1186
01:12:17,304 --> 01:12:18,623
Right, here goes.

1187
01:12:21,744 --> 01:12:24,702
Right, that ought to surprise them
back at the research centre.

1188
01:12:24,784 --> 01:12:27,173
- Next gentleman, please.
- Come on.

(ALL LAUGHING)

1190
01:12:31,824 --> 01:12:36,579
For the last time, Linx,
let there be no more talk of leaving.

1191
01:12:36,664 --> 01:12:40,339
And I tell you for the last time,
I am leaving now.

1192
01:12:40,704 --> 01:12:42,183
Our alliance is at an end.

1193
01:12:42,264 --> 01:12:45,700
It ends when I say it ends and not before.

1194
01:12:45,784 --> 01:12:49,014
You would be well advised to march
from this castle now and capture another.

1195
01:12:49,104 --> 01:12:51,733
Soon you will have need of it.

1196
01:12:51,824 --> 01:12:56,500
- He threatens us, Captain.
- He does not understand our ways.

1197
01:12:57,264 --> 01:13:01,542
Tomorrow, Linx, we smite the enemy, hip and thigh!

1198
01:13:02,184 --> 01:13:04,334
But tonight, we feast.

1199
01:13:04,944 --> 01:13:08,653
By your dawn, I shall be 700 million miles from here.

1200
01:13:09,264 --> 01:13:12,301
Can I be concerned with the fate of primitives?

(ALL LAUGHING)

1202
01:13:15,584 --> 01:13:17,814
What did he mean, Captain?

1203
01:13:19,304 --> 01:13:20,737
He is a toad.

1204
01:13:22,704 --> 01:13:24,899
Who knows what a toad thinks?

1205
01:13:27,664 --> 01:13:31,020
Aye, Captain, 'tis truly said.

1206
01:13:37,304 --> 01:13:39,977
This stew has made me heavy.

1207
01:13:42,224 --> 01:13:43,577
Eh?

1208
01:13:53,944 --> 01:13:55,263
That's Linx.

1209
01:13:55,344 --> 01:13:57,983
Send the rest of them back.
I'll try and keep him busy.

(SNORING)

1211

Trickery! Sorcery!

1212
01:14:27,183 --> 01:14:28,821
- Now you, Professor.
- I really don't think

1213
01:14:28,903 --> 01:14:30,461
- I ought to go and leave you.
- Off you go now.

1214
01:14:30,543 --> 01:14:33,660
- Now then, this, this and this.
- Well, goodbye and good luck.

1215
01:14:33,743 --> 01:14:35,654
It really was the most fascinating experience.

1216
01:14:35,743 --> 01:14:38,576
I hope you and the Doctor will be all right.
See you back at research centre.

SARAH: Doctor!

1218
01:14:43,543 --> 01:14:44,658
So...

1219
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:50,061
destroy my castle by sorcery, would you, toad face?

1220
01:14:50,142 --> 01:14:52,815
Well, Irongron's magic is too strong for you!

1221
01:15:15,942 --> 01:15:17,091
Now listen, dog!

1222
01:15:17,182 --> 01:15:19,935
In minutes now, this castle
will be destroyed by the sorcery.

1223
01:15:20,022 --> 01:15:23,332
If you'd save your miserable skins, then get you gone!

1224
01:15:29,382 --> 01:15:30,974
Flee, dogs!

1225
01:15:31,062 --> 01:15:33,940
Flee for your life! Come on, waken, you dogs!

1226
01:15:34,022 --> 01:15:36,013
And flee! Flee for your lives, you dogs!

1227

Waken! Waken up! Now flee!

1228
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:44,779
Doctor, do get up. We've got to get you out.

He must have hit the takeoff button too soon.

Come on, we've got about a minute
to get out of here. Quick! Run!

Well, you can tell Sir Edward
that his problems are over, Hal.

1236
01:16:44,341 --> 01:16:46,138
Irongron, his castle,

1237
01:16:46,221 --> 01:16:49,019
his magic weapons and his sorcerer,
they're all destroyed.

1238

Will you not tell him yourself, Doctor?

1239
01:16:50,741 --> 01:16:53,335
He will reward you well. We owe you much.

1240
01:16:53,421 --> 01:16:56,254
I'm sorry. I'm afraid we must be off.

- Goodbye, Hal.
- Goodbye, Doctor.

- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

You are truly a great magician, Doctor.

To tell you the truth, Hal, I'm not a magician at all.

I'm not so sure about that.
