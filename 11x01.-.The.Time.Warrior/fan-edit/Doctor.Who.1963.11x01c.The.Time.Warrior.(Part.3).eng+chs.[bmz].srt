1
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:06,100
Doctor! Up here!
博士，上这儿来！

2
00:40:29,747 --> 00:40:31,658
Thank you very much, Miss Smith. A most timely rescue.
非常感谢你，史密斯小姐，救援来得正是时候

3
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:33,942
This isn't a rescue, Doctor, it's a capture.
这不是救援，博士，这是抓捕

4
00:40:34,027 --> 00:40:35,619
Let's get him out of here.
我们先带他离开这里

5
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,486
That fellow has the gall of a camel and the cunning of a fox!
那个家伙有着骆驼的胆汁，狐狸的狡猾!

6
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:19,321
You shall have your revenge, Captain.
He'll be with Sir Edward now.
你得要报这个仇，头儿，他现在去了爱德华爵士那里了

7
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:21,875
And not even a rat will come out of that castle alive tomorrow.
到了明天，就是一只耗子也别想活着从那个城堡里出来

8
00:41:21,967 --> 00:41:24,925
By the stars, Bloodaxe, I swear I'll chop him up so fine
对着星星发誓，Bloodaxe，我会把他切碎

9
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:28,238
not even a sparrow will fill its beak at one peck!
碎得连麻雀都没法下嘴

10
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:32,627
One of my workers has disappeared.
我的一个工人不见了

11
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:34,379
Order a search of your castle.
下令搜索你的城堡吧

12
00:41:34,467 --> 00:41:36,981
If you've lost one of your dumb, whey-faced ninnies, Linx,
如果你那些面色惨白的蠢人少了一个，Linx

13
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:39,785
then look for him yourself. My men are at rest.
你得自己去找。我的人正在休息

14
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:41,779
We march on Sir Edward within the hour.
我们一个小时内就要向爱德华爵士进军

15
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:46,816
I insist upon a search, Irongron.
The Doctor is of great value to me.
我坚持要求搜索，Irongron。博士对我价值非凡

16
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:49,216
And while he is at large, he could be dangerous.
而且如果他逍遥在外的话，就无比危险

17
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:50,342
The Doctor?
博士？

18
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:54,579
Bother me now, little toad,
and you will feel an axe in your skull!
这会儿烦我的话，小蟾蜍，小心我的斧头砍掉你的脑袋！

19
00:41:54,707 --> 00:41:59,462
Master, I heard someone call ''Doctor''
while we were at that fellow's heels.
主人，我们在追那个家伙的时候，听到谁喊了一声“博士”

20
00:41:59,547 --> 00:42:03,017
Is this Doctor a long shank rascal with a mighty nose?
这个博士是不是个长腿的家伙，有个大鼻子？

21
00:42:03,107 --> 00:42:05,223
That is how he would appear in human eyes.
在人类眼中他应该是那样

22
00:42:05,307 --> 00:42:07,377
Then he is no longer here.
那他现在已经不在这里了

23
00:42:08,107 --> 00:42:10,826
Sir Edward sent raiders to my castle,
captured him.
爱德华爵士派了人到我的城堡来，把他抓走了

24
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,545
He has escaped!

25
00:42:13,147 --> 00:42:15,342
- Tell Sir Edward we're back.
- Yes.
- 告诉爱德华爵士我们这就回去 - 遵命

26
00:42:15,427 --> 00:42:18,305
- Now...
- You've been getting around, Sarah.
- 现在...  - 你还真是阴魂不散啊，莎拉

27
00:42:18,387 --> 00:42:21,060
Are you on visiting terms with all the local nobility?
你跟这里所有本地贵族都有来往？

28
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:24,025
Doctor, let's get a few things straight, shall we?
博士，我们有话直说，好吗

29
00:42:24,147 --> 00:42:27,105
Oh, dear. I'm afraid you're going to be awfully confused
哦，亲爱的，我担心你会非常困惑的

30
00:42:27,187 --> 00:42:29,496
if you ask me to explain about the Tardis.
如果你想问我的是 TARDIS 是怎么回事的话

31
00:42:29,587 --> 00:42:32,181
- The Tardis?
- Yes, my police box.
- TARDIS?  - 是的，我的警察电话亭

32
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:34,098
You were a stowaway, I imagine.
你是个偷渡客，我想

33
00:42:34,187 --> 00:42:36,257
Yes, but we'll come to that later.
是的，但这个问题我们稍后再说

34
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:40,863
- Now then, why are you helping Irongron?
- My dear girl, I'm not helping him.
- 现在说说，你为什么要帮 Irongron？
- 亲爱的姑娘，我没在帮 Irongron

35
00:42:41,587 --> 00:42:44,055
Linx is. I'm trying to stop him.
Linx才在帮，我一直想阻止他

36
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:45,375
SARAH: Linx?

37
00:42:45,467 --> 00:42:48,140
Yes, perhaps you're lucky enough not to have met him yet.
是的，也许你是运气太好了，还没有碰到他

38
00:42:48,227 --> 00:42:51,185
Nasty, brutish and short just about sums him up.
用几个词来总结的话，他是个险恶, 野蛮和短小的家伙

39
00:42:52,067 --> 00:42:54,501
There was a strange-looking knight with Irongron.
Irongron 那里是有一个长相奇特的骑士

40
00:42:54,587 --> 00:42:58,102
Yes, he'd have looked even stranger
if he hadn't been wearing space armour.
是的，如果他没有戴太空头盔的话，会看起来更奇怪

41
00:42:58,107 --> 00:43:01,502
He comes from a planet
where the surface gravity is many times that of Earth.
他来的那个星球，重力是地球的好几倍

42
00:43:01,587 --> 00:43:03,703
- A man from the stars?
- Mmm-hmm.
- 一个从星星上来的人？  - 嗯哼

43
00:43:03,787 --> 00:43:07,257
- How do I know you're telling the truth?
- Because I never lie.
- 我怎么知道你说的是实话？ - 因为我从不撒谎

44
00:43:07,347 --> 00:43:09,303
Well, hardly ever.
好吧，基本上从不

00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:12,498
You ever heard of UNIT?
你听说过 UNIT 吗？

00:43:12,587 --> 00:43:14,259
You work for UNIT?
你为 UNIT 工作？

In an advisory capacity, yes.
是的，以顾问的身份

48
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:20,545
They asked me to look into this question
of the missing scientists for them.
他们让我帮忙调查一下有科学家失踪的问题

49
00:43:20,627 --> 00:43:22,140
But I thought you were responsible for that.
但我觉得你才是这事的黑手

50
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:25,185
My dear girl, I don't go round kidnapping scientists!
亲爱的姑娘，我不会去绑架科学家！

51
00:43:25,267 --> 00:43:27,622
No, Linx brought them here to staff his workshop.
不，Linx 把他们带到这里来了，用作他工作间的工人

52
00:43:27,707 --> 00:43:29,937
Now I've got to find a way of
sending them back to their own time.
现在我得找到一个方法，把他们送回自己的时间去

53
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:33,542
- This is the magician?
- Yes. This is the Doctor.
- 这位就是那个魔法师？ - 是的，他是博士

54
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:36,025
You have done well, Sarah.

55
00:43:37,267 --> 00:43:38,376
How do you do?
你好

56
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:42,022
It is a pleasure and a privilege
to be in the company of civilised people at last.
我很高兴，也很荣幸，终于见到文明人了

57
00:43:42,107 --> 00:43:43,222
A courtly rogue.
这家伙还挺有礼貌

58
00:43:43,307 --> 00:43:47,263
Is he willing to change his allegiance
and serve Sir Edward instead of Irongron?
他愿意改变效忠对象，从 Irongron 转向为爱德华爵士服务吗？

59
00:43:47,507 --> 00:43:49,418
Well, he says he wasn't serving Irongron.
哦，他说他没在为 Irongron 服务

60
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:52,260
And there is another stranger at the castle,
someone called Linx.
在那个城堡里还有另外一个陌生人，叫 Linx

61
00:43:52,347 --> 00:43:54,542
Yes, he's your enemy, I assure you,
not me.
是的，他才是你的敌人，我不是，我向你保证

62
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:57,141
We'd be well advised to join forces against him.
我倒非常建议我们连起手来对付他

63
00:43:57,227 --> 00:43:59,616
- Does he speak truth?
- I'm not sure.
- 他说的是实情吗？  - 我不太确定

64
00:43:59,707 --> 00:44:01,584
I suppose I could have been wrong.
我想我可能是搞错了

65
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,146
That's a generous admission.
那还算坦诚

66
00:44:03,227 --> 00:44:05,058
Especially coming from one of the fair sex.
尤其是这话来自一位公平的性别(?)

67
00:44:05,147 --> 00:44:07,615
Or he could just be changing sides to save his own skin.
也或者他是临阵倒戈，只是为了自己的小命

68
00:44:07,707 --> 00:44:10,744
These wizards and warlocks were ever a treacherous breed.
巫师和术士从来都是奸诈的家伙

69
00:44:10,827 --> 00:44:12,818
We'd best be wary of him.
我们最好小心他

70
00:44:13,587 --> 00:44:14,815
I shall spare your life
我打算饶了你的命

71
00:44:14,907 --> 00:44:18,900
if you cast your spells and incantations
to help me against Irongron, Doctor.
前提是你要帮我，用魔法与咒语对付 Irongron，博士

72
00:44:18,987 --> 00:44:20,818
Refuse and you die.
如果拒绝你就死了

73
00:44:21,947 --> 00:44:24,461
You offer a somewhat restricted choice, Sir Edward.
你给我的选择很有限啊，爱德华爵士

74
00:44:24,547 --> 00:44:26,697
EDWARD: What is your answer?
你的答案是什么？

75
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:30,186
My services are at your disposal, sir.
我听候您的差遣，爵士

76
00:44:31,307 --> 00:44:33,104
- Such as they are.
- Good.

77
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:36,340
Serve me straight, Doctor, and I shall reward you well.
为我服务，博士，我将给你很好的回报

78
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:39,857
Oh, master... Oh, but, master,
Irongron marches here before noon!
噢，主人...但是，主人，Irongron 的队伍午前就能到达这里！

79
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:41,665
We heard this said from his own mouth.
我们听到他亲口说的

80
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:45,057
Then we are lost. We cannot stand against them.
那我们就完了，我们没法跟他们对抗

81
00:44:45,147 --> 00:44:47,900
- On the contrary, sir, I think we can.
- But how? With a handful of men?
- 恰恰相反，爵士，我觉得我们可以 - 怎么对抗？就这几个人？

82
00:44:47,987 --> 00:44:52,055
Yes, sir, with just a few men I think
I can persuade Irongron that we have a full garrison.
是的，爵士，虽然只有几个人，我想我能让 Irongron 认为我们驻扎了大批人马

83
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,945
By the use of your magic?
凭着你的魔法？

84
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:56,745
By creating an illusion, anyway.
制造一个假象就行

85
00:44:56,827 --> 00:45:00,820
Your magic will have to be powerful
indeed to discourage Irongron.
你的魔法必须的足够强大才能吓退 Irongron

86
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,579
It will be, sir.
会的，爵士

87
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:06,459
- The men are ready, Captain.
- Good.
- 人都就绪了，头儿   - 很好

88
00:45:06,547 --> 00:45:08,378
Though for such an easy conquest as this,
即便是一趟如此容易的任务

89
00:45:08,467 --> 00:45:11,061
'tis scarce worth strapping on armour!
穿戴上盔甲还是值得的

90
00:45:11,147 --> 00:45:13,581
You and I alone, good Bloodaxe, could take that castle!
我的好 Bloodaxe，你跟我两个人，就可以拿下这座城堡！

91
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,100
Indeed we could, Captain.
我们还真可以，头儿

92
00:45:15,187 --> 00:45:17,143
With Sir Edward's treasure I shall hire more men,
夺了爱德华爵士的财宝，我又可以招募更多人手了

93
00:45:17,227 --> 00:45:20,981
and with Linx's weapons to arm them,
who shall stand against us?
再配备上 Linx 制造的武器，谁还敢跟我们做对？

94
00:45:21,107 --> 00:45:23,143
When does the fighting start, Irongron?
战斗什么时候开始，Irongron?

95
00:45:23,227 --> 00:45:25,980
In the time it takes to ride from here to Sir Edward's castle.
我们从这里出发去爱德华爵士的城堡，一到就开打

96
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:28,535
- Then I shall come with you.
- What, you?
- 那我跟你一起去   - 什么，你？

97
00:45:28,627 --> 00:45:32,745
Ha! Bloodaxe, on my oath,
can you see that on a scaling ladder?
哈！Bloodaxe, 我得发誓，你可能看见这家伙站在攻城梯上面吗？

98
00:45:33,627 --> 00:45:35,697
I have an interest in seeing the battle.
我有兴趣观看战斗过程

99
00:45:35,787 --> 00:45:38,506
Those eyes have a thirst for blood.
那双眼睛很渴望见血啊

100
00:45:38,587 --> 00:45:41,784
Well, find our bold warrior a horse, Bloodaxe.
好，给我们勇敢的战士找一匹马，Bloodaxe

101
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,420
Come, then!
那就来吧！

- Thank you, Sarah.
- 这里还给你找了一些，博士  - 谢谢你，莎拉

103
00:45:51,947 --> 00:45:55,462
Lady Eleanor's got every serving wench
in the castle sewing away like mad.
Eleanor 夫人让城堡里面的所有侍女都在做缝制，跟疯了似的

104
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:57,902
I told you there'd be plenty of work
for everybody, didn't I?
我跟你说过每个人都有很多工作要做，对不？

105
00:45:57,987 --> 00:46:00,342
Oh. Typically masculine arrangement, though.
噢，这安排就是典型的大男子主义

106
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:02,736
We do all the dirty work, you get all the fun.
所有脏活累活都我们干，你就乐趣独享

107
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:06,263
You don't think mixing this singularly noxious compound is fun, do you?
你不会认为搅拌这些罕见的有毒化合物是一种乐趣吧，是吗？

108
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,702
- How's the rest of it going?
- Not bad.
- 其它事情怎么样了？  - 不赖

109
00:46:08,787 --> 00:46:11,506
I put Sir Edward in charge of painting the dummies' faces.
我让爱德华爵士负责画这些假人的脸

110
00:46:11,587 --> 00:46:13,543
He's turned out to be quite an artist.
结果发现他还是个不错的艺术家

111
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:16,465
- Once I'd set him on the right lines.
- Excellent.
- 看来我还给他安排对了 - 非常好

112
00:46:16,587 --> 00:46:19,738
- I'm glad I decided to let you stay.
- You decided?
- 我很高兴我当时决定让你留下来了 - 你决定的？

113
00:46:20,347 --> 00:46:22,781
You know, I was never much of a hand
with a paint brush myself.
你知道吗，我几乎从来没有自己拿过画笔

114
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:24,903
- No?
- No.
- 没有？  - 没有

115
00:46:25,347 --> 00:46:27,303
Nor a palette knife for that matter.
也没有拿过调色板刀

116
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:29,503
I'd like to study under one of the masters one day.
我想有一天我要到其中一个大师那里去学习去

117
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:31,384
Rembrandt, preferably.

118
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:33,059
- Rembrandt!
- Mmm-hmm.
- 伦勃朗！  - 嗯哼

119
00:46:33,147 --> 00:46:36,105
Can you... Can you just go anywhere
you like in that Tardis?
你能...你能去任何你想去的地方吗，就坐你那个 TARDIS ？

120
00:46:36,187 --> 00:46:37,256
Yes, within reason.
是的，只要有合适的理由

121
00:46:37,347 --> 00:46:39,781
Then why are you staying here?
Why don't you go somewhere safer?
那为什么你要呆在这里？ 为什么你不去别的安全些的地方？

122
00:46:39,867 --> 00:46:42,859
Because, my dear Sarah, I've got a job to do.
因为，亲爱的莎拉，我有工作要做

123
00:46:42,947 --> 00:46:45,745
One that involves the whole future of your species.

124
00:46:46,427 --> 00:46:48,497
Here, hold this will you?

125
00:46:48,587 --> 00:46:50,305
- My species?
- Mmm-hmm.

126

You're talking as if you weren't human.
你说得好像你不是人似的

127
00:46:52,787 --> 00:46:54,300
Well, the definition of the word ''humanity''
说起来呢，“人性”这个词的定义

128
00:46:54,387 --> 00:46:56,503
was always rather a complex question, wasn't it?
一直都是一个挺复杂的问题，是吧

129
00:46:56,587 --> 00:47:00,023
You know perfectly well what I mean.
Are you or aren't you?
你完全清楚我是什么意思，是还是不是？

130
00:47:00,107 --> 00:47:02,098
If you mean am I a native of the planet Terra,
如果你问的是我是不是地球这个星球的原住民

131
00:47:02,187 --> 00:47:03,620
the answer is no, I'm not.
答案是不，我不是

132
00:47:03,707 --> 00:47:06,016
- Well, what are you, then?
- Me? I'm a Time Lord.
