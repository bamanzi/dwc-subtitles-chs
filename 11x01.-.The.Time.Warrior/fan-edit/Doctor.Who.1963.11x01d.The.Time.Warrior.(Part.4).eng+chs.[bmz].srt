The female, too. It seems I am doubly fortunate.
那个女性也来了，看来我是双重幸运了

00:58:17,005 --> 00:58:19,758
- Get up. Get back to work!
- DOCTOR: Linx.
- 起来，回去工作！ - Linx

5
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:24,840
Can't you see that your prisoners
are physically exhausted?
你看不到你的囚徒身体都已经耗尽了吗？

6
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:27,241
They've had no sleep and nothing to eat for days.

7

- They can still work!

as the super race?

Your Time Lord philosophy is egalitarian twaddle.

Every species has its own weakness, Linx.

举个例子, 只有对准你的通气口猛击，你才会被击晕

LINX: In our case, Doctor, it is a strength,

18
00:58:59,685 --> 00:59:02,438
because it means we must always face our enemies.

- You, too, Doctor.
- 是的，继续吧，不过要小心  - 你也是，博士

29
00:59:41,525 --> 00:59:44,756
Right. Well, if we can secure our friend here,
好。嗯，如果我们能限制住这位朋友

30
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:48,723
we can get on with the job of restoring
his wretched victims.

Well, that should hold him for a while,
even on this planet.

Why this planet?
为什么说“这个星球”？

39
01:00:14,685 --> 01:00:17,802
Well, in his own environment, he weighs several tons.
哦，在他们的环境下，他重达好几吨

40
01:00:17,885 --> 01:00:21,240
Fortunately, his muscles have been designed
for load bearing rather than leverage
幸运的是, 他的肌肉是为承重而设计的, 而不是力量(?)

41
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:22,714
Fascinating.
