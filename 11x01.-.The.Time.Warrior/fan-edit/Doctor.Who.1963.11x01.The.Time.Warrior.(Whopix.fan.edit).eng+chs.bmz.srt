on all these scientist chaps at home,

I'm sure the Doctor's the key to it all.

As it is, how can I fight Irongron and this doctor?
就目前来说，我怎么才能打得过 Irongron 和这个博士呢？

I insist upon a search, Irongron.
The Doctor is of great value to me.
我坚持要求搜索，Irongron。博士对我价值非凡

670
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:49,216
And while he is at large, he could be dangerous.
而且如果他逍遥在外的话，就无比危险

671
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:50,342
The Doctor?
博士？

672
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:54,579
Bother me now, little toad,
and you will feel an axe in your skull!
这会儿烦我的话，小蟾蜍，小心我的斧头砍掉你的脑袋！

673
00:41:54,707 --> 00:41:59,462
Master, I heard someone call ''Doctor''
while we were at that fellow's heels.
主人，我们在追那个家伙的时候，听到谁喊了一声“博士”

674
00:41:59,547 --> 00:42:03,017
Is this Doctor a long shank rascal with a mighty nose?
这个博士是不是个长腿的家伙，有个大鼻子？

675
00:42:03,107 --> 00:42:05,223
That is how he would appear in human eyes.
在人类眼中他应该是那样

676
00:42:05,307 --> 00:42:07,377
Then he is no longer here.
那他现在已经不在这里了

677
00:42:08,107 --> 00:42:10,826
Sir Edward sent raiders to my castle,
captured him.
爱德华爵士派了人到我的城堡来，把他抓走了

678
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,545
He has escaped!
他居然逃了！

679
00:42:13,147 --> 00:42:15,342
- Tell Sir Edward we're back.
- Yes.
- 告诉爱德华爵士我们这就回去 - 遵命

680
00:42:15,427 --> 00:42:18,305
- Now...
- You've been getting around, Sarah.
- 现在...  - 你还真是阴魂不散啊，莎拉

681
00:42:18,387 --> 00:42:21,060
Are you on visiting terms with all the local nobility?
你跟这里所有本地贵族都有来往？

682
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:24,025
Doctor, let's get a few things straight, shall we?
博士，我们有话直说，好吗

683
00:42:24,147 --> 00:42:27,105
Oh, dear. I'm afraid you're going to be awfully confused
哦，亲爱的，我担心你会非常困惑的

684
00:42:27,187 --> 00:42:29,496
if you ask me to explain about the Tardis.
如果你想问我的是 TARDIS 是怎么回事的话

685
00:42:29,587 --> 00:42:32,181
- The Tardis?
- Yes, my police box.
- TARDIS?  - 是的，我的警察电话亭

686
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:34,098
You were a stowaway, I imagine.
你是个偷渡客，我想

687
00:42:34,187 --> 00:42:36,257
Yes, but we'll come to that later.
是的，但这个问题我们稍后再说

688
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:40,863
- Now then, why are you helping Irongron?
- My dear girl, I'm not helping him.
- 现在说说，你为什么要帮 Irongron？
- 亲爱的姑娘，我没在帮 Irongron

689
00:42:41,587 --> 00:42:44,055
Linx is. I'm trying to stop him.
Linx才在帮，我一直想阻止他

690
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:45,375
SARAH: Linx?

691
00:42:45,467 --> 00:42:48,140
Yes, perhaps you're lucky enough not to have met him yet.
是的，也许你是运气太好了，还没有碰到他

692
00:42:48,227 --> 00:42:51,185
Nasty, brutish and short just about sums him up.
用几个词来总结的话，他是个险恶, 野蛮和短小的家伙

693
00:42:52,067 --> 00:42:54,501
There was a strange-looking knight with Irongron.
Irongron 那里是有一个长相奇特的骑士

694
00:42:54,587 --> 00:42:58,102
Yes, he'd have looked even stranger
if he hadn't been wearing space armour.
是的，如果他没有戴太空头盔的话，会看起来更奇怪

695
00:42:58,107 --> 00:43:01,502
He comes from a planet
where the surface gravity is many times that of Earth.
他来的那个星球，重力是地球的好几倍

696
00:43:01,587 --> 00:43:03,703
- A man from the stars?
- Mmm-hmm.
- 一个从星星上来的人？  - 嗯哼

697
00:43:03,787 --> 00:43:07,257
- How do I know you're telling the truth?
- Because I never lie.
- 我怎么知道你说的是实话？ - 因为我从不撒谎

698
00:43:07,347 --> 00:43:09,303
Well, hardly ever.
好吧，基本上从不

699
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:12,498
You ever heard of UNIT?
你听说过 UNIT 吗？

700
00:43:12,587 --> 00:43:14,259
You work for UNIT?
你为 UNIT 工作？

701
00:43:14,347 --> 00:43:16,656
In an advisory capacity, yes.
是的，以顾问的身份

702
00:43:17,587 --> 00:43:20,545
They asked me to look into this question
of the missing scientists for them.
他们让我帮忙调查一下有科学家失踪的问题

703
00:43:20,627 --> 00:43:22,140
But I thought you were responsible for that.
但我觉得你才是这事的黑手

704
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:25,185
My dear girl, I don't go round kidnapping scientists!
亲爱的姑娘，我不会去绑架科学家！

705
00:43:25,267 --> 00:43:27,622
No, Linx brought them here to staff his workshop.
不，Linx 把他们带到这里来了，用作他工作间的工人

706
00:43:27,707 --> 00:43:29,937
Now I've got to find a way of
sending them back to their own time.
现在我得找到一个方法，把他们送回自己的时间去

707
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:33,542
- This is the magician?
- Yes. This is the Doctor.
- 这位就是那个魔法师？ - 是的，他是博士

708
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:36,025
You have done well, Sarah.
你做得很好，莎拉

709
00:43:37,267 --> 00:43:38,376
How do you do?
你好

710
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:42,022
It is a pleasure and a privilege
to be in the company of civilised people at last.
我很高兴，也很荣幸，终于见到文明人了

711
00:43:42,107 --> 00:43:43,222
A courtly rogue.
这家伙还挺有礼貌

712
00:43:43,307 --> 00:43:47,263
Is he willing to change his allegiance
and serve Sir Edward instead of Irongron?
他愿意改变效忠对象，从 Irongron 转向为爱德华爵士服务吗？

713
00:43:47,507 --> 00:43:49,418
Well, he says he wasn't serving Irongron.
哦，他说他没在为 Irongron 服务

714
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:52,260
And there is another stranger at the castle,
someone called Linx.
在那个城堡里还有另外一个陌生人，叫 Linx

715
00:43:52,347 --> 00:43:54,542
Yes, he's your enemy, I assure you,
not me.
是的，他才是你的敌人，我不是，我向你保证

716
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:57,141
We'd be well advised to join forces against him.
我倒非常建议我们连起手来对付他

717
00:43:57,227 --> 00:43:59,616
- Does he speak truth?
- I'm not sure.
- 他说的是实情吗？  - 我不太确定

718
00:43:59,707 --> 00:44:01,584
I suppose I could have been wrong.
我想我可能是搞错了

719
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,146
That's a generous admission.
那还算坦诚

720
00:44:03,227 --> 00:44:05,058
Especially coming from one of the fair sex.
尤其是这话来自一位公平的性别(?)

721
00:44:05,147 --> 00:44:07,615
Or he could just be changing sides to save his own skin.
也或者他是临阵倒戈，只是为了自己的小命

722
00:44:07,707 --> 00:44:10,744
These wizards and warlocks were ever a treacherous breed.
巫师和术士从来都是奸诈的家伙

723
00:44:10,827 --> 00:44:12,818
We'd best be wary of him.
我们最好小心他

724
00:44:13,587 --> 00:44:14,815
I shall spare your life
我打算饶了你的命

725
00:44:14,907 --> 00:44:18,900
if you cast your spells and incantations
to help me against Irongron, Doctor.
前提是你要帮我，用魔法与咒语对付 Irongron，博士

726
00:44:18,987 --> 00:44:20,818
Refuse and you die.
如果拒绝你就死了

727
00:44:21,947 --> 00:44:24,461
You offer a somewhat restricted choice, Sir Edward.
你给我的选择很有限啊，爱德华爵士

728
00:44:24,547 --> 00:44:26,697
EDWARD: What is your answer?
你的答案是什么？

729
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:30,186
My services are at your disposal, sir.
我听候您的差遣，爵士

730
00:44:31,307 --> 00:44:33,104
- Such as they are.
- Good.
- 跟他们一样  - 很好

731
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:36,340
Serve me straight, Doctor, and I shall reward you well.
为我服务，博士，我将给你很好的回报

732
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:39,857
Oh, master... Oh, but, master,
Irongron marches here before noon!
噢，主人...但是，主人，Irongron 的队伍午前就能到达这里！

733
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:41,665
We heard this said from his own mouth.
我们听到他亲口说的

734
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:45,057
Then we are lost. We cannot stand against them.
那我们就完了，我们没法跟他们对抗

735
00:44:45,147 --> 00:44:47,900
- On the contrary, sir, I think we can.
- But how? With a handful of men?
- 恰恰相反，爵士，我觉得我们可以 - 怎么对抗？就这几个人？

736
00:44:47,987 --> 00:44:52,055
Yes, sir, with just a few men I think
I can persuade Irongron that we have a full garrison.
是的，爵士，虽然只有几个人，我想我能让 Irongron 认为我们驻扎了大批人马

737
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,945
By the use of your magic?
凭着你的魔法？

738
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:56,745
By creating an illusion, anyway.
制造一个假象就行

739
00:44:56,827 --> 00:45:00,820
Your magic will have to be powerful
indeed to discourage Irongron.
你的魔法必须的足够强大才能吓退 Irongron

740
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,579
It will be, sir.
会的，爵士

741
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:06,459
- The men are ready, Captain.
- Good.
- 人都就绪了，头儿   - 很好

742
00:45:06,547 --> 00:45:08,378
Though for such an easy conquest as this,
即便是一趟如此容易的任务

743
00:45:08,467 --> 00:45:11,061
'tis scarce worth strapping on armour!
穿戴上盔甲还是值得的

744
00:45:11,147 --> 00:45:13,581
You and I alone, good Bloodaxe, could take that castle!
我的好 Bloodaxe，你跟我两个人，就可以拿下这座城堡！

745
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,100
Indeed we could, Captain.
我们还真可以，头儿

746
00:45:15,187 --> 00:45:17,143
With Sir Edward's treasure I shall hire more men,
夺了爱德华爵士的财宝，我又可以招募更多人手了

747
00:45:17,227 --> 00:45:20,981
and with Linx's weapons to arm them,
who shall stand against us?
再配备上 Linx 制造的武器，谁还敢跟我们做对？

748
00:45:21,107 --> 00:45:23,143
When does the fighting start, Irongron?
战斗什么时候开始，Irongron?

749
00:45:23,227 --> 00:45:25,980
In the time it takes to ride from here to Sir Edward's castle.
我们从这里出发去爱德华爵士的城堡，一到就开打

750
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:28,535
- Then I shall come with you.
- What, you?
- 那我跟你一起去   - 什么，你？

751
00:45:28,627 --> 00:45:32,745
Ha! Bloodaxe, on my oath,
can you see that on a scaling ladder?
哈！Bloodaxe, 我得发誓，你可能看见这家伙站在攻城梯上面吗？

752
00:45:33,627 --> 00:45:35,697
I have an interest in seeing the battle.
我有兴趣观看战斗过程

753
00:45:35,787 --> 00:45:38,506
Those eyes have a thirst for blood.
那双眼睛很渴望见血啊

754
00:45:38,587 --> 00:45:41,784
Well, find our bold warrior a horse, Bloodaxe.
好，给我们勇敢的战士找一匹马，Bloodaxe

755
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,420
Come, then!
那就来吧！

756
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:51,862
- Here's a few more for you, Doctor.
- Thank you, Sarah.
- 这里还给你找了一些，博士  - 谢谢你，莎拉

757
00:45:51,947 --> 00:45:55,462
Lady Eleanor's got every serving wench
in the castle sewing away like mad.
Eleanor 夫人让城堡里面的所有侍女都在做缝制，跟疯了似的

758
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:57,902
I told you there'd be plenty of work
for everybody, didn't I?
我跟你说过每个人都有很多工作要做，对不？

759
00:45:57,987 --> 00:46:00,342
Oh. Typically masculine arrangement, though.
噢，这安排就是典型的大男子主义

760
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:02,736
We do all the dirty work, you get all the fun.
所有脏活累活都我们干，你就乐趣独享

761
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:06,263
You don't think mixing this singularly noxious compound is fun, do you?
你不会认为搅拌这些罕见的有毒化合物是一种乐趣吧，是吗？

762
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,702
- How's the rest of it going?
- Not bad.
- 其它事情怎么样了？  - 不赖

763
00:46:08,787 --> 00:46:11,506
I put Sir Edward in charge of painting the dummies' faces.
我让爱德华爵士负责画这些假人的脸

764
00:46:11,587 --> 00:46:13,543
He's turned out to be quite an artist.
结果发现他还是个不错的艺术家

765
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:16,465
- Once I'd set him on the right lines.
- Excellent.
- 看来我还给他安排对了 - 非常好

766
00:46:16,587 --> 00:46:19,738
- I'm glad I decided to let you stay.
- You decided?
- 我很高兴我当时决定让你留下来了 - 你决定的？

767
00:46:20,347 --> 00:46:22,781
You know, I was never much of a hand
with a paint brush myself.
你知道吗，我几乎从来没有自己拿过画笔

768
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:24,903
- No?
- No.
- 没有？  - 没有

769
00:46:25,347 --> 00:46:27,303
Nor a palette knife for that matter.
也没有拿过调色板刀

770
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:29,503
I'd like to study under one of the masters one day.
我想有一天我要到其中一个大师那里去学习去

771
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:31,384
Rembrandt, preferably.
伦勃朗，我比较偏好这个

772
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:33,059
- Rembrandt!
- Mmm-hmm.
- 伦勃朗！  - 嗯哼

773
00:46:33,147 --> 00:46:36,105
Can you... Can you just go anywhere
you like in that Tardis?
你能...你能去任何你想去的地方吗，就坐你那个 TARDIS ？

774
00:46:36,187 --> 00:46:37,256
Yes, within reason.
是的，只要有合适的理由

775
00:46:37,347 --> 00:46:39,781
Then why are you staying here?
Why don't you go somewhere safer?
那为什么你要呆在这里？ 为什么你不去别的安全些的地方？

776
00:46:39,867 --> 00:46:42,859
Because, my dear Sarah, I've got a job to do.
因为，亲爱的莎拉，我有工作要做

777
00:46:42,947 --> 00:46:45,745
One that involves the whole future of your species.
其中一项跟你们这个物种的整体前途有关

778
00:46:46,427 --> 00:46:48,497
Here, hold this will you?
拿住这里，可以吗？

779
00:46:48,587 --> 00:46:50,305
- My species?
- Mmm-hmm.
- 我们这个物种？  - 嗯哼

780
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:52,696
You're talking as if you weren't human.
你说得好像你不是人似的

781
00:46:52,787 --> 00:46:54,300
Well, the definition of the word ''humanity''
说起来呢，“人性”这个词的定义

782
00:46:54,387 --> 00:46:56,503
was always rather a complex question, wasn't it?
一直都是一个挺复杂的问题，是吧

783
00:46:56,587 --> 00:47:00,023
You know perfectly well what I mean.
Are you or aren't you?
你完全清楚我是什么意思，是还是不是？

784
00:47:00,107 --> 00:47:02,098
If you mean am I a native of the planet Terra,
如果你问的是我是不是地球这个星球的原住民

785
00:47:02,187 --> 00:47:03,620
the answer is no, I'm not.
答案是不，我不是

786
00:47:03,707 --> 00:47:06,016
- Well, what are you, then?
- Me? I'm a Time Lord.
- 那，你是什么呢？  - 我？我是个时间领主

787
00:47:06,467 --> 00:47:09,186
- A Time Lord?
- Yes, that's right.
- 一个时间领主？  - 是的，正是

788
00:47:09,267 --> 00:47:13,021
And my people are very keen
to stamp out unlicensed time travel.
我的人民非常热衷于消灭未授权的时间旅行

789
00:47:13,307 --> 00:47:17,380
You can look upon them as
galactic ticket inspectors if you like.
你可以把他们看作星际的检票员

790
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,935
- Galactic ticket inspectors?
- Mmm-hmm.
- 星际检票员？  - 嗯哼  

791
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:24,381
I could murder a cup of tea. You're serious, aren't you?
我真想喝杯茶。你是说真的，是吗？

792
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:27,903
About what I do, yes. Not necessarily the way I do it.
对于我做什么，是真的。对于我做事的方法，则不一定

793
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:39,345
That's made them stop and think, anyway.
不管怎样，这使得他们停下来考虑考虑了

794
00:47:41,027 --> 00:47:42,301
They've got guns!
他们有枪！

795
00:47:42,707 --> 00:47:45,221
No man has fallen, Captain!
没有人掉下来，头儿！

796
00:47:45,307 --> 00:47:49,346
- Your weapons do not work, Linx!
- You do not shoot them straight!
- 你的武器不管用，Linx  - 你都射偏了

797
00:47:49,427 --> 00:47:50,906
Watch.
看着

798
00:47:58,227 --> 00:48:01,503
- LINX: Those figures are dummies.
- Bah, your weapons are useless!
- 那些是假人

00:56:22,027 --> 00:56:23,619
Doctor, what are you doing?
博士，你在干什么？

936
00:56:23,707 --> 00:56:25,937
- Trying to break this hypnosis.
- It's very deep.

937

Narcoleptic condition, eh?

938
00:56:27,947 --> 00:56:30,519
The brain can still receive signals, Professor.
他大脑还可以接收信号，教授

939
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,539
Why can't you just send them as they are?
为什么不现在这样子送他们回去？

940
00:56:32,627 --> 00:56:34,663
It's too risky with their minds in this state.
以他们的意识目前的状态来说，这样风险太大了

941
00:56:34,747 --> 00:56:36,465
The transition might damage them permanently.

942
00:56:36,547 --> 00:56:38,299
I've never heard so much gobbledegook in me life.

943
00:56:38,387 --> 00:56:40,025
But I expect you know what you're talking about.
但我还指望你能知道你在说什么

944
00:56:40,107 --> 00:56:41,335
- Polka time!
- BOTH: What?
- 好戏来了！ - 什么？

945
00:56:41,427 --> 00:56:44,783
It's the beat. Look, he's beginning to respond.

00:57:12,107 --> 00:57:13,779
Get up or I will kill you!

00:57:13,867 --> 00:57:15,937
- Leave him, Linx!

00:57:21,467 --> 00:57:23,344
was the one thing that marred the pleasure

00:57:23,427 --> 00:57:26,499
of my approaching departure from this miserable planet.
眼看我就要离开这个悲惨的星球了

956
00:57:26,587 --> 00:57:28,225
Don't you want to know why I've returned?
你不知道为什么我会回来吗？

957
00:57:28,307 --> 00:57:29,820
It is of no interest to me.
我对这个没有兴趣

958
00:57:29,907 --> 00:57:31,545
I came here to offer you my help.
我来这里是提供帮助的

959
00:57:31,627 --> 00:57:33,857
We're sworn enemies, Doctor. Why should you help me?

960
00:57:33,947 --> 00:57:36,097
Because I want something from you.
因为我需要你提供点东西

If you will let me de-hypnotise people
and send them home

then I will assist you in the repairs to your spaceship.

964
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:48,180
Now, the weapons that you've made for Irongron

SARAH: No!
不要！

974
00:58:11,485 --> 00:58:15,558
The female, too. It seems I am doubly fortunate.
那个女性也来了，看来我是双重幸运了

975
00:58:17,005 --> 00:58:19,758
- Get up. Get back to work!
- DOCTOR: Linx.
- 起来，回去工作！ - Linx

976
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:24,840
Can't you see that your prisoners
are physically exhausted?
你看不到你的囚徒身体都已经耗尽了吗？

977
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:27,241
They've had no sleep and nothing to eat for days.
他们好多天没睡眠没吃东西了

978
00:58:27,325 --> 00:58:29,793
- They can still work!
- Not for much longer.

LINX: I owe these primitives nothing.

My only concern is to rejoin our glorious struggle for freedom.

DOCTOR: That's such an old tune.

00:58:38,845 --> 00:58:41,234
Don't you know there's no such thing
as the super race?

983
00:58:41,325 --> 00:58:44,840
Your Time Lord philosophy is egalitarian twaddle.
你们时间领主的哲学无非是平等主义那些废话

984
00:58:44,925 --> 00:58:46,643
It is a weakness.
这是个弱点

985
00:58:46,725 --> 00:58:49,478
Every species has its own weakness, Linx.
每个物种都有自己的弱点，Linx

986
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:54,603
For instance, you can only be stunned
by a blow on the probic vent,
举个例子, 只有对准你的通气口猛击，你才会被击晕

987
00:58:55,005 --> 00:58:57,678
that small hole at the back of your neck.
那个通气口在你脖子后面的小洞那里

988

LINX: In our case, Doctor, it is a strength,
在我们看来，博士，这是种力量

989
00:58:59,685 --> 00:59:02,438
because it means we must always face our enemies.

if you witnessed first the destruction
of your female companion.

Yes. The blast was too brief.

- Yes. All right, but be careful.
- You, too, Doctor.
- 是的，继续吧，不过要小心  - 你也是，博士

1000
00:59:41,525 --> 00:59:44,756
Right. Well, if we can secure our friend here,
好。嗯，如果我们能限制住这位朋友

1001
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:48,723
we can get on with the job of restoring
his wretched victims.
我们还可以继续恢复这些可怜的受害者

1002
00:59:48,805 --> 00:59:50,557
Will this help?

Rubeish, you're invaluable, my dear chap.

Fetch me Linx.

At once, Captain.

1008
01:00:11,245 --> 01:00:13,361
Well, that should hold him for a while,
even on this planet.

1009
01:00:13,445 --> 01:00:14,594
Why this planet?
为什么说“这个星球”？

1010
01:00:14,685 --> 01:00:17,802
Well, in his own environment, he weighs several tons.
哦，在他们的环境下，他重达好几吨

1011
01:00:17,885 --> 01:00:21,240
Fortunately, his muscles have been designed
for load bearing rather than leverage
幸运的是, 他的肌肉是为承重而设计的, 而不是力量(?)

1012
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:22,714
Fascinating.
有意思

I'd always assumed that creatures
from a high-density planet

1014
01:00:25,365 --> 01:00:27,833
would have developed a pressure-balanced physiology.

1015
01:00:27,925 --> 01:00:29,756
For example, if you take certain types of seaweed...
比如，如果你找几样海藻...

1016
01:00:29,845 --> 01:00:32,962
BLOODAXE: Linx! Linx!

01:00:38,325 --> 01:00:40,156
-Linx?

反正，我不会推荐他加入皇家学会

- What do you propose to do?
- 我就把这个事情留给你了

I was going to preset this osmic projector.

Send these people back to their own time.

You common scullion, stand aside!
你，粗鄙的下人，站一边去！

- 一位小姐穿得跟个侍女一样？

bread nor meat for nearly a month.
请放我走吧，我已经快一个月没有吃过面包或白面了

by the look of you.

Why has he not himself obeyed my summons?

My master toils in his workshop to make you more fighting robots.
我的主人正在他的工作间里忙碌，给你造更多的战斗机器人

not against you.

many pieces as did your brother.

噢，又在大厅里打斗了，我敢肯定
