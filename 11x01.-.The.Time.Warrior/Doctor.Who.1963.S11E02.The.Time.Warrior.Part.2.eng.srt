to someone called the Doctor.

97
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:02,324
He is a scientist.
He was at the research centre.

98

He said he was very fond
of delta particles.

Ah. Is he here?

100
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:11,678
Yes. Somewhere. I was hiding
in the machine when he left.

102

for insolence!

It is just a suit of steel. It is empty.

-But it walks!
-It walks.

110
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:50,874
And it fights, Irongron.
Is it a good weapon?

111
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:52,960
Does it kill?

112
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,923
It does nothing else
and it cannot be killed.

can you make me more of these?

If you wish.

115
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:03,516
With a few such soldiers as that,
I could take the world!

When I have left this dull planet,

Very well, provide me
with all that I ask for

-It's a bargain.

157
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,837
Are they all so fair of face
beyond the stars?

158
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,836
The variety of sentient life forms
is infinite.

159
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:20,439
Do you think your primitive features
are pleasing to me?

160
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:24,153
-Well, what is it you want?
-That accursed iron warrior of yours.

161
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:25,518
You are pleased with it?

162
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:29,153
Some knave with a crossbow
shot the control from my hand.

163
00:11:29,244 --> 00:11:31,997
The iron man became crazed,
tried to kill all of us.

164
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:35,679
Perhaps the hand control unit itself
is a weakness.

165
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:38,756
I will make you
a better warrior, Irongron.

166
00:11:38,844 --> 00:11:40,755
One that'll obey your voice perhaps.

167
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:45,156
First, help me kill the one I have now.
It still struggles to slay my knaves.

168
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:48,202
It cannot be killed. It was never alive.

169
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:50,844
Come, I will de-activate it.

170
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:33,362
Professor Morrison?

171
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:37,917
Professor.

172
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:51,562
Absolute lunacy.

173
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:03,120
-Rubeish!
-What? Who is it?

174
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:05,680
It's me. It's the Doctor.
Don't you remember?

175
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:07,516
We were on the same landing
at the research centre.

176
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:10,164
Oh, my dear fellow.
So he's got you, too, has he?

177
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:14,157
No, hardly. Look, Professor,
what's wrong with all these people?

178
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:17,156
Hypnotised. Can't get a word
out of them. Rotten company.

179
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:19,474
-Well, you seem to be all right.
-Oh, didn't work with me.

180
00:13:19,564 --> 00:13:21,953
-Strong-minded, you see.
-Yes, and very nearly blind.

181
00:13:22,044 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh, nonsense.

182
00:13:24,084 --> 00:13:26,917
Obviously working some sort
of ocular device.

183
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:28,722
Professor,
have you any idea where you are?

184
00:13:28,804 --> 00:13:31,113
Some medieval English castle, I suspect.

185
00:13:31,204 --> 00:13:33,354
I've been feeling the carvings
on some of these columns.

186
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:34,877
They're astonishingly well preserved.

187
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:37,876
Yes, you're in a castle all right,
but do you know the time?

188
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:41,957
About four in the afternoon.
We haven't had breakfast yet, you know.

189
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:44,558
Doesn't feed us much.
Once a day if we're lucky.

190
00:13:44,644 --> 00:13:46,441
Now, Professor, listen to me.

191
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:49,243
This may come as a shock to you
so steel yourself.

192
00:13:49,324 --> 00:13:53,033
You have been brought back to
the early years of the Middle Ages.

193
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,682
That's interesting.

194
00:13:54,764 --> 00:13:56,561
I've always maintained
that the Loop Theory of Time

195
00:13:56,644 --> 00:13:59,238
shouldn't have been so arrogantly
dismissed by Crabshaw and his cronies.

196
00:13:59,324 --> 00:14:00,723
Tell me about it some other time.

197
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:02,522
We've got to get out of here
before Linx comes back.

198
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:05,164
Not yet, Doctor.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.

199
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,678
There's some
most interesting work being done here.

200
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,595
If only I could see it all properly.

201
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:12,278
Professor, your life is in considerable
danger. I must insist you...

202
00:14:12,364 --> 00:14:15,322
You go if you want to, Doctor.
Go on, but leave me alone.

203
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:18,282
-Professor, don't you understand?
-Stop!

204
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:28,876
-You are the one called the Doctor?
-You know who I am?

205
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:33,355
I have been expecting you.
Why did you follow me to this time?

206
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:35,321
To prevent your interference
with the affairs of Earth.

207
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:36,917
Don't you realise
the harm that you'll cause?

208
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:39,677
This primitive planet and its affairs
are of no importance.

209
00:14:39,764 --> 00:14:41,277
That's a typically Sontaran attitude.

210
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,473
Only one thing matters,
to complete the repairs to my ship

211
00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:47,361
and return to the glorious war
that is my destiny.

212
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:51,197
Nothing must interfere with that,
nothing and nobody.

213
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:56,910
I vouch for her, my lord.
Without her help, I would not be here.

214
00:14:57,002 --> 00:14:59,436
She looks like one I would trust.

215
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:02,161
Sit, child. Tell us where you're from.

216
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,675
I can't. It's too difficult to explain.

217
00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:09,397
The manner of her dress is strange,
and the manner of her speech.

218
00:15:09,482 --> 00:15:12,360
There is much strange
at Irongron's castle, Sir Edward.

219
00:15:12,442 --> 00:15:15,161
I told you of the knight that fights on
though it should be dead.

220
00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:17,472
And one of the guards told me
there's a man from the stars

221
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:20,395
that lives among them.
A mighty wizard who makes magic weapons.

222
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:22,040
A man from the stars.

223
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,352
I've heard it said
he has the help of devils and magicians.

224
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:27,832
-It is true, Sir Edward. I have seen it.
-Well, I know who's helping him.

225
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:29,514
-It's the Doctor.
-The doctor?

226
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:32,196
Well, that's what he calls himself,
but he's no magician.

227
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:35,160
-Just some eccentric scientist.
-What does she say?

228
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:38,518
The words are strange,
but I know her meaning.

229
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:40,991
Who is this doctor?
What do you know of him?

230
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:43,277
Scientists, learned men.

231
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:46,001
They're being taken
from the place I come from,

232
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:47,800
and I believe that the Doctor
is bringing them here

233
00:15:47,882 --> 00:15:49,361
and handing them over to Irongron.

234
00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:51,512
What would Irongron want
with these wizards?

235
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:53,354
To make him magic weapons, my lady.

236
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:55,319
Irongron thinks only
of war and conquest.

237
00:15:55,402 --> 00:15:58,519
Anything that makes Irongron strong
can work only to our harm.

238
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:00,832
With an army of magic knights
such as I fought,

239
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:02,913
Irongron could conquer
the whole kingdom.

240
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:05,516
Who knows what other sorceries
he may soon have at his command?

241
00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:07,832
I'm sure the Doctor's the key to it all.

242
00:16:07,922 --> 00:16:10,072
He was there when one
of the scientists was taken.

243
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:12,118
He has a machine
that can travel through time.

244
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:15,558
Well, it must be him,
and somehow we've got to stop him.

245
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,155
If he's Irongron's ally,

246
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,995
he sits safe within Irongron's walls.
There's nought we can do.

247
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:23,597
Oh, there's always something you can do.
It's just a matter of working out what.

248
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,594
-A brave speech.
-She has the heart of a lion, sire.

249
00:16:26,682 --> 00:16:28,832
I saw her give Irongron
the sharp edge of her tongue.

250
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:32,551
If I had an army of girls such as you,
I might hold this castle forever.

251
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:36,191
As it is, how can I fight Irongron
and this doctor?

252
00:16:36,282 --> 00:16:38,876
All right, I'll tell you how.

253
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:41,032
Now, the first thing we must do
is grab the Doctor

254
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:42,635
and get him away from Irongron.

255
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:45,555
And force him to make his magic for me?
Good thought.

256
00:16:45,642 --> 00:16:47,200
Aye, but how could it be done?

257
00:16:47,282 --> 00:16:50,911
Oh, what's wrong with you?
All it needs is a sort of commando raid.

258
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:52,799
You knock out the sentries,
rush into the castle,

259
00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:54,679
grab the Doctor and away.

260
00:16:54,762 --> 00:16:57,356
-You've got soldiers, haven't you?
-A handful.

261
00:16:57,442 --> 00:16:59,512
-A raid? A bold plan.
-I'll go, Sir Edward.

262
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:06,436
You resisted well, Doctor.

263
00:17:06,522 --> 00:17:08,831
I could have increased the power,
but I might have killed you.

264
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:10,514
I need you alive.

265
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:13,116
A brain of your capacity
can be of use to me.

266
00:17:13,202 --> 00:17:14,840
Thank you.

267
00:17:14,922 --> 00:17:16,913
You're not of this planet.
How came you to be here?

268
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,072
Oh, I'm just a tourist. I like it here.

269
00:17:19,162 --> 00:17:22,791
-This hole in space?
-You haven't seen it at its best.

270
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:26,761
It has no military value,
no strategic significance.

271
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:29,072
Once again, a Sontaran philosophy.

272
00:17:29,162 --> 00:17:32,472
I'm Commander Linx,
Fifth Sontaran Army Space Fleet.

273
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:35,759
Ah, yes. Yes, as I thought.

274
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,434
A Sontaran warrior.

275
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:42,991
So, the perpetual war
between the Sontarans and the Rutans

276
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:47,155
-has spread to this tiny planet, has it?
-Emergency landing.

277
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:49,392
I was on a reconnaissance mission
when I was attacked

278
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:51,791
by a squadron of Rutan fighters.

279
00:17:53,002 --> 00:17:55,721
You have encountered
my race before, Doctor?

280
00:17:55,802 --> 00:17:57,281
Unfortunately.

281
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,915
I'll overlook that insult
for the moment.

282
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:08,513
-What is your native planet?
-Gallifrey. I am a Time Lord.

283
00:18:08,602 --> 00:18:10,558
Ah, yes.

284
00:18:10,642 --> 00:18:13,918
A race of great technical achievement,

285
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:16,470
but lacking the morale
to withstand a determined assault.

286
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,555
-Oh, you think so?
-I'm only a lowly commander, Doctor.

287
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:24,317
I merely quote from the appreciation
circulated by our military intelligence.

288
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:25,551
Well, you'd be well advised

289
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:28,156
never to put that appreciation
to the test, Linx.

290
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:32,997
My only ambition at the moment
is to return to my squadron.

291
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:37,437
You can be of value to me.
You can help repair this ship.

292
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:39,797
You seem to have acquired
some help already.

293
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:43,670
Primitives.
I adapted my ship's frequency modulator

294
00:18:43,762 --> 00:18:46,993
and projected myself forward
as far as I could.

295
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:50,438
Unfortunately, I only had the power
to reach the 20th century.

296
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:51,955
From which you stole the equipment

297
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:53,760
and the skilled help
that you couldn't find here.

298
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:54,911
Yes.

299
00:18:55,882 --> 00:18:57,918
But the work goes slowly.

300
00:18:58,842 --> 00:19:02,039
Commander Linx, if you will return
these people to their own time,

301
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:03,396
I might possibly consider helping you.

302
00:19:03,482 --> 00:19:06,280
Do not attempt
to bargain with me, Doctor!

303
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:10,681
Take that seat there by the controls.

304
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:12,596
Move.

305
00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:18,150
You're interfering with
human evolution, Linx.

306
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:21,518
Don't you realise the damage
that you're going to do to them?

307
00:19:21,602 --> 00:19:24,275
I have no interest in human evolution.

308
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,116
I'm placing you under
auto-control, Doctor,

309
00:19:33,202 --> 00:19:35,762
to ensure your complete cooperation.

310
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,834
Human beings must be allowed
to develop at their own pace.

311
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:41,482
At this period, they're just a few steps
away from barbarism.

312
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:46,033
You will monitor progress rates on
the input panel against the programmer.

313
00:19:48,202 --> 00:19:51,114
Now I must leave you
in charge for a time.

314
00:20:02,762 --> 00:20:04,320
You give them breech-loading guns now,

315
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:06,711
they'll have atomic weapons
by the 1 7th century.

316
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:09,073
They'll have the capability to destroy
their own planet

317
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:10,719
before they're civilised enough
to handle it!

318
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,916
You would do well to concentrate
on the task I have given you, Doctor.

319
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,831
Answer the programmer.

320
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,039
(ZAPPING)

321
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,038
I still say this is no work for women.

322
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,519
I wouldn't have
missed this for anything.

323
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,672
Anyway, I'm the only one
who knows what the Doctor looks like.

324
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,398
Come on, this way.

325
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,551
Ah, now these are more
to my taste than your iron man, Linx.

326
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,677
I will still perfect the fighting robot
for your army, Irongron.

327
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,398
We'll take these weapons
to the men, Bloodaxe,

328
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,119
and I shall instruct them in their use.

329
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,159
Tomorrow morning, at dawn,
we march on Sir Edward's castle.

330
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,798
Yes, Captain.

331
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,519
By sunset he'll be feeding the crows.

332
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,911
Rubeish! Professor, over here quickly.

333
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,558
Is that you, Doctor?
I thought you were going.

334
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,438
-A change of plan. I want your help.
-Are you wearing a hat?

335
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,238
Behind me you'll find a panel.
There's a switch on it.

336
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,753
It's dangerous, overheats the brain.

337
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:48,996
-Panel... Oh, yes, I've got it.
-Right, turn the switch.

338
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,149
I've always thought
that's why judges are so peculiar.

339
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:52,592
It's those wigs they wear.

340
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,749
No! No! That's the wrong... No, no, man!

341
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:57,558
Sorry. I do wish I'd brought my glasses.

342
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:00,714
Yes, so do I. It was the wrong one.

343
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,948
Is this the one?

344
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:15,633
Yes, that was the one.
Thank you very much indeed, Professor.

345
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:20,349
-Not at all, Smith.
-Smith. Yes, of course.

346
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,828
Will you excuse me?
I've got to go and find a young girl.

347
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,955
I'll see you later, I hope.

348
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,072
Young girl? I should've thought
he was a bit old for that sort of thing.

349
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,228
Oh, well.

350
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:36,316
Ah, good evening.

351
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,394
Get after him! Call the guards!

352
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:43,435
(SHOUTING)

353
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,311
Catch him!

354
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,677
(SHOUTING)

355
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,068
Grab him! Grab him!

356
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,115
(SHOUTING)

357
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:18,468
He who strikes Irongron dies!
