At this close range, his arrows'll
pierce the armour's weak points.
在这么近的距离下, 他的箭会刺穿盔甲的薄弱之处

138
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:46,321
- Take aim, fellow.
- I am that.
- 瞄准, 伙计  - 我瞄好了

Your freedom if you kill him. Stand back.
你能否自由就看你能否杀了他了。往后退

Your champion'll have more arrows
in his gizzard than a thistle has spikes.
你的护卫身上中的箭可要比刺猬的刺还多了

By heavens, Bloodaxe, 'tis like a tin tadpole.
老天，Bloodaxe，这家伙就像个蝌蚪似的

148
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:12,280
You cut off its head and yet it wriggles.

Well? What is it you need to say to me?

Aye, and never was truer word spoken.

Are they all so fair of face beyond the stars?

The variety of sentient life forms is infinite.
智慧生命的形式是无限的

162

Do you think your primitive features are pleasing to me?
就你们这原始生命的相貌，你觉得我会喜欢吗？

-Well, what is it you want?
-That accursed iron warrior of yours.

Some knave with a crossbow shot the control from my hand.
某个拿十字弓的混蛋从我手上把控制器射掉了

The iron man became crazed, tried to kill all of us.
那个铁人就疯了，要杀了我们所有人

167
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:35,679
Perhaps the hand control unit itself is a weakness.

I will make you a better warrior, Irongron.

It still struggles to slay my knaves.
首先，帮我杀了我已经有的那个，它还在追杀我的那些混球呢

噢，亲爱的朋友，这么说他把你也抓住了，是吗？

what's wrong with all these people?
不，没那么容易。看看，教授，这些人是怎么回事？

Some medieval English castle, I suspect.

I've been feeling the carvings on some of these columns.

They're astonishingly well preserved.

190
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:37,876
Yes, you're in a castle all right,
but do you know the time?
是的，你的确是在一座城堡里，但你知道时间吗？

191
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:41,957
About four in the afternoon.
We haven't had breakfast yet, you know.
大约下午四点。我们连早饭还没吃呢，你看

Doesn't feed us much. Once a day if we're lucky.
很少给我们提供食物，运气好的话一天有一顿

193
00:13:44,644 --> 00:13:46,441
Now, Professor, listen to me.

This may come as a shock to you so steel yourself.

You have been brought back
to the early years of the Middle Ages.

196
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,682
That's interesting.
这很有意思

00:13:54,764 --> 00:13:56,561
I've always maintained that the Loop Theory of Time
我一直就觉得＜时间循环理论＞

198
00:13:56,644 --> 00:13:59,238
shouldn't have been so arrogantly dismissed
by Crabshaw and his cronies.
不应该被 Crabshaw 那帮人轻易地否定了

199
00:13:59,324 --> 00:14:00,723
Tell me about it some other time.

Not yet, Doctor. This is the opportunity of a lifetime.

There's some most interesting work being done here.

If only I could see it all properly.

I must insist you...
教授，你的性命处于相当大的危险之中，我坚持要你...

To prevent your interference with the affairs of Earth.

Don't you realise the harm that you'll cause?

211
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:39,677
This primitive planet and its affairs are of no importance.
这个原始星期的事情没什么重要的

212
00:14:39,764 --> 00:14:41,277
That's a typically Sontaran attitude.

213
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,473
Only one thing matters, to complete the repairs to my ship

00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:47,361
and return to the glorious war that is my destiny.

I can't. It's too difficult to explain.
我没法说，这太难解释了

Scientists, learned men.

Irongron could conquer the whole kingdom.

he may soon have at his command?

他稳稳地坐在 Irongron 的城墙内，我们拿他没办法

It's just a matter of working out what.
噢，总是会有办法的，只是具体什么办法的问题

- She has the heart of a lion, sire.
- 这话很勇敢 - 她有一颗狮子一般的心，大人

我看见过他跟 Irongron 唇枪舌战

I might hold this castle forever.
如果我有一队像你这样的女孩儿，我可能就可以永远守住这座城堡了

All it needs is a sort of commando raid.
噢，你们怎么回事？只需要一个突击小队什么的就行了啊
