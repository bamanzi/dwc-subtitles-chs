Doctor, why don't you take a break?
博士，你为什么不休息一下？

6
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,615
It's maddening, you know. So nearly there.
很让人抓狂啊，知道吧。感觉很接近了

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,615
If I could only cut out their override
on the dematerialisation circuit.
只要我能切断他们的优先控制权就好了，他们锁住了反物质化电路

What gave you that idea?
谁给了你这样的想法？

00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:39,175
Oh, being dragged off to an alien planet
five hundred years in the future, for example.
哦，比如说，我被拖到了五百年后的一颗外星

13
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:41,575
Oh, you know - all that business
with the miners and the colonists.
你知道的，都是矿工啊殖民者啊那些事

My dear Jo, the TARDIS was being operated then 
under remote control by the High Council of the Time Lords.
亲爱的 Jo, TARDIS 那时候是被时间领主最高议会远程控制着呢

15
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:47,442
Well, if it worked for them...
如果对他们来说这可以用...

16
00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:50,789
I don't want it to work for them.
I want it to work for me.
我不想它对他们可以用，我想要它对我可以用

17
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:53,889
No-one's going to turn me into
an interplanetary puppet.
任何人别想把我变成一个星际傀儡

18
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,857
Yes, of course. Why didn't I think of that before?

Yes, of course. I remember now.
是的，当然，我想起来了

Look, don't worry, my dear. 
I know you're alarmed but you needn't be.
看，别担心，亲爱的。我知道你受惊了，但没有必要

00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:21,441
Yes, well I think that should do it. 
Why on Earth I never realised that...

22
00:02:21,783 --> 00:02:23,420
Oh no! What are you doing here?

Well, I'm not here. Don't worry.
其实，我没在这里。别担心

but, erm, you are not there.
不过，其实是，某种程度上，我在这里，但是，呃，你不在那里

Er... yes, well, it's a bit difficult
to explain really.
呃...这个，的确有点难解释

26
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:37,279
This won't do at all!
We can't have two of us running about.

Yes, well don't worry. It will all sor...

00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,531
Doctor! What happened?

29
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:47,536
Well, it's a very complicated thing - time - Jo.
这个, 它是一件很复杂的事情 - 时间 - Jo

30
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:51,536
Once you've begun tampering with it,
the oddest things start happening.

31
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,917
But there was another you and another... me.

32
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,531
Well, where've they gone?
他们都去哪儿了？

33
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:59,620
Back into their own time stream, of course.
Or do I mean forward?

34
00:02:59,631 --> 00:03:01,250
But, Doctor, I don't understand...
但是，博士，我搞不明白...

35
00:03:01,262 --> 00:03:05,233
Look, Jo. Don't worry about it. It was a freak affect. 
It's very unlikely to happen again.
听着, Jo, 别担心。这是一个奇怪的现象，非常不可能再次发生

36
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:06,967
Hold that and give me those papers.

Now then, you've heard of Sir Reginald Styles?

No, can't say that I have.

Well isn't he the chief representative at the UN?

44
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:28,322
That's right - key figure at the latest
summit conference.

45
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:30,537
My dear chap, I'm a scientist. Not a politician.
我亲爱的小伙，我是个科学家，不是个政客

47
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:35,297
...tinkering around with this wretched contraption,

48
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,989
you'd realise just how bad
the international situation's become.
你就会意识到国际形势变得多么糟糕

49
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:40,166
Humans are always squabbling over something, Brigadier.
人类总是会为点什么事争论不休, 准将

ending up in a third world war.
是的, 好吧, 这一次的争吵看起来像是要导致第三次世界大战似的

51
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:48,397

Without them, the conference can't even begin.

Now Styles is flying to Peking in a few hours./?
现在 Styles 几个小时后就要飞往北京

53
00:03:50,412 --> 00:03:52,997
There's just a chance that he can
persuade them to change their minds.
他也许有机会说服他们改变主意

54
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:56,126
All right, Brigadier. So what's his problem?
好吧, 准将。那他那里有什么问题？

00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,906
Well, he was working late last night,
down at Auderly...

Where's that?
Auderly 是什么地方？

00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,142
Auderly, Miss Grant, is a Government owned
country house about fifty miles north of London/?
Auderly 是政府拥有的一栋乡村房子，在伦敦北面大约50英里

58
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:05,622
- where the conference is due to be held.

He suddenly started behaving... rather oddly./?

Seemed to think that someone

Some sort of "ghost" apparently.

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,636
He said somebody attacked him and vanished.

And you're absolutely certain that
he used the word "ghost"?

65
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,483
Oh yes. But afterwards he...
嗯是的，但随后他...

66
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:35,988
Miss Paget! What's going on here?!
Paget 小姐！这是在干什么？

67
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:37,992

There seems to have been
some sort of incident, Sir Reginald?

72
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:46,319
Nothing of any importance.

73
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:48,368
Well, if you could tell us what happened?

I was working late. I must have dropped off.

Freak gust of wind, blew some papers off my desk,

- 这个时候 Paget 小姐进来的  - 但你的确之前提到过“鬼魂”

Did I? Must have been having a nightmare.
有吗？我肯定是做了噩梦了

But the French windows weren't shut.
I closed them before I went to bed.
但落地窗没有关闭。我在上床之前是关了的

80
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:07,394
Then I must have opened them!

81
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:13,092
Did you, er, did you also make
those marks on the floor over there?
是你, 呃, 是你在那边地板上留下了那些痕迹吗？

Someone was in here, you know.

Are you accusing me of lying, sir?!

Sir Reginald, you've obviously been 
under considerable strain recently.

I felt, and feel, perfectly well.

Sergeant!

啊, 他情况不好, 可怜的家伙, 你最好把他送医院去

- Captain Yates...  - Right away, sir.
- Yates 队长...  - 马上, 先生

93
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:59,481
This is a new one on me.
What do you make of it, Doctor?

94
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:03,257
I'm not sure...

No idea, sir.

It was hidden about fifty feet inside the tunnel.

Have you seen this before?

00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:22,586
Really Brigadier!
What sort of games are you playing?
真的吗, 准将！你到底在玩什么游戏？

101
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,967
It's not a game, sir. 
It's our duty to protect you!
这不是游戏, 先生。我们有责任保护你！

00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:26,562
I don't need your protection!

00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:31,295
Sir Reginald, we've just found a very severely
injured man down by the canal tunnel.
Reginald 爵士, 我们在运河隧道边发现一个严重受伤的人

104
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:33,555
Oh really? And what did he look like?
哦真的吗？他什么样子？

105
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:38,723
Thirty-fiveish, average build. He was wearing
a sort of guerilla combat suit.
大约25岁, 中等身材, 穿着一种迷彩作战服

106
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,871
- And carrying that gun.
- I am very sorry, gentlemen,
- 还带着枪  - 我很抱歉, 先生们

107
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:44,396
but I have rather more important things
on my mind at the moment.
但我这会儿想起还有更加重要的事情

108
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:47,247
- If you'll excuse me?
- I've arranged an escort to take you to the airport, sir.
- 抱歉呢  - 我安排几个人护送你到机场去, 爵士

109
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:48,708
Thank you, but it shouldn't be necessary.

110
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:50,300
I'm sorry, sir, but I think it will!
抱歉, 爵士, 但我觉得有必要

111
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:51,631
Oh, if you insist.
哦, 你非得坚持

112
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,512
I'd like to get that gun down to the laboratory
and run a few tests on it.
我得把那把枪拿到实验室去做几个测试

113
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:05,162
Well, basically it's a form of ultra-sonic disintegrator.
好了, 基本上来说它是一种超声裂解枪

114
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,361
You mean a ray gun?
你是说射线枪？

115
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:08,514
That's right, Jo, I mean a ray gun.
说对了, Jo, 我的意思是射线枪

116
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:13,214
Only it's far more sophisticated than any weapon
yet invented on Earth. Now take a look at this.
只不过它比地球上说造的任何武器都复杂, 现在看着

117
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:19,825
Quite an effective little weapon, eh?
非常厉害的小武器, 是哈？

118
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:25,472
Doctor, you say this wasn't made on Earth.
Do you mean it comes from another planet?
博士, 你说它不是在地球上造的, 那就是说它来自其它星球？

119
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,479
Well that was my theory at first, yes.
这也是我一开始的想法, 是

120
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,979
But the metallurgical analysis shows that the,
er, iron constituent is very much of this world.
但是材料分析却表明, 它的钢铁成分是属于这个世界的

121
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,779
In fact, it was mined not very far from here
- North Wales.
事实上, 就来自离这里不远的地方 - 北威尔士

122
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:37,761
How do you explain that?
那你怎么解释？

123
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:42,080
Do you believe in ghosts, Brigadier?
你相信鬼魂吗, 准将？

124
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,247
Let's be serious, Doctor.
我们说正经的了, 博士

125
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:44,252
I am.
我很正经

126
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:45,792
Oh, come along, Doctor, come along.
哦, 得了, 博士, 拉倒吧

127
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:50,714
Oh, my mistake. I was forgetting
the unimaginative nature of the military mind.
哦, 我错了, 我忘记了一个军人的大脑是没有想象力的

128
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:54,214
But we saw a couple of "Amicus Seperatus"
a few moments ago, didn't we, Jo?
当我们在不久之前见到 Amicus Seperatus 现象了, 对不, Jo?

129
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:55,202
Did we?
有吗？

130
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:56,725
Yes, here in this laboratory.
是的, 就在这实验室

131
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:57,985
Oh, you mean when we...
哦, 你是说我们那时...

132
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,697
Mind you, they were manifestations
of a much more benevolent kind.
fixme

133
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,197
None of your clanking chains and chilly fingers!
But ghosts, none the less.

134
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:09,942
That was because you were playing around
with the time mechanism on the TARDIS, wasn't it?
那是因为你当时在折腾 TARDIS 的时间机制, 是吧？

135
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:11,934
Still can't get it to work, eh?
还是没法让它工作啊, 嗯？

136
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:13,918
Well, I can't get this thing to work, either.
是啊, 我也不能让它工作

137
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:18,588
But this is a form of, er, of time machine
of a very crude kind.
但这是一个, 呃, 时间机器, 比较粗糙的那种

138
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:19,935
How do you know?
你怎么知道？

139
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:21,305
Come over here. Look at this.
到这里来, 看看这个

140
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:24,158
Now what do you think that is?
你觉得这是什么？

141
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,885
Ooh, it's a... mini-dematerialisation circuit.
哦, 这是个...迷你型的反物质化电路

142
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:29,853
Top of the class, Jo.
Now then, pop this in here, like that.
优等生, Jo。既然如此, 把这个塞到这里, 这样

143
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,150
Now, as far as I can gather,
when you push this button, it should...
现在, 据我的推断, 一旦你按下这个按钮, 它就可以...

144
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:36,637
Good grief! It's working!
老天爷, 它可以工作了！

145
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:46,898
Sir?
头儿？

146
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:48,255
What is it?
什么事？

147
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:51,292
Time transmitter in operation, sir.
Twentieth Century Zone.
时间发射器在运转了, 头儿, 在20世纪区域

148
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:53,565
Can you fix the space-time coordinates?
你能锁定时空坐标吗？

149
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,053
Do be careful, Doctor!
小心点, 博士！

150
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,882
All right, Jo, all right.
没事的, Jo, 没事

151
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,305
- Well?  - No good, sir.
- 怎样  - 不行, 头儿

152
00:08:58,427 --> 00:09:02,208
There was a transference, I think, 
but the machine's cut out completely.
刚才有干扰, 我觉得, 然后机器就完全切断了

153
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:07,234
Continue scanning - and next time
you had better be more efficient!
继续扫描 - 下次你最好效率高点

154
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,417
Report!
报告！

155
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:16,695
Yes, I see. All right, sergeant.
You'd better report back to Captain Yates. Goodbye.
是的, 我明白, 没事, 中士。你最好报告给 Yates 队长, 再见

156
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:19,807
That was Benton. He was in the ambulance
with the man we found.
 Benton, 他刚才跟我们找到的那个人一起在救护车上

157
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:20,920
Well?
怎么了？

158
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:26,999
Well according to him, that man just...
vanished, faded away
据他所说, 那个人刚刚...消失了, 慢慢淡出了

159
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:29,246
- like a ghost.  - Oh no!
- 像鬼一样  - 噢, 不！

160
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:30,904
Well, Doctor, what now?
那, 博士, 现在怎么办？

161
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:34,166
Well, everything that happens seems to
centre round Styles' house.
嗯, 发生的所有这些事似乎都是跟 Style 的房子有关的

162
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:35,532
Obviously.
这显然

163
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:37,604
And whoever tried to harm him
will probably try again.
那些试图伤害他的人, 很可能还会再次下手

164
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:43,940
Jo, how would you like to spend the night
in a haunted house?
Jo, 你觉得到闹鬼的房子里过一晚怎么样？

165
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:08,846
Wake up, Jo.
醒醒, Jo

166
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:10,678
It's all right. It's morning.
没什么事, 天亮了

167
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,052
Nothing's happened?
什么都没发生？

168
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:13,175
No, nothing at all.
没有, 完全没有

169
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:50,901
Jo! Jo!
Jo! Jo!

170
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:34,224
Please! Turn that machine off
- or they'll kill all of us! Please!
拜托, 把那个机器关掉 - 不然他们会把我们都杀死！求你了

171
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:40,237
Sir?
头儿？

172
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:41,219
Yes?
怎么？

173
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:43,492
We've picked up that time transmitter again.
我们又识别到那个时间发射器了

174
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:44,377
You're sure?
你确定吗？

175
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:48,166
Yes, sir. Same frequency, same time...
time zone. Much stronger now.
是的, 头儿。同样的频率同样的时间..时区。现在信号强多了

176
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,427
Right. I want the exact space-time co-ordinates,
so whatever happens, don't lose it!
好, 我要确切的时空坐标, 所有不管发生什么, 不要跟丢了

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,300
What is your report?
你要报告什么？

178
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,436
We have a fix on the time transfer device.
我们已经锁定了那个时间传送装置

179
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:07,436
It is operating again in the twentieth century
time zone and it must be them.
它在20世纪区域再次开启, 肯定是他们

180
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:13,131
You have obtained the space-time co-ordinates?
你已经得到了时空坐标？

181
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:16,819
We're trying now. The trace is
much stronger this time.
我们正在尝试, 这次信号比较强

182
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:19,626
- There is every chance...
- You must not fail!
- 这次肯定有机会...  - 你必须成功！

183
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,278
Security forces are standing by.
安全部队已经在待命了

184
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,778
If we do get the co-ordinates, 
what are your instructions?
如果我们拿到坐标, 你们有什么指示？

185
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:36,737
Whoever is operating the time machine
is an enemy of the Daleks.
不管是谁在操作那个时间机器, 他都是 Daleks 的敌人

186
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:42,937
All enemies of the Daleks must be destroyed!
Exterminate them!
而 Daleks 的所有敌人都必须消灭！终结他们！
