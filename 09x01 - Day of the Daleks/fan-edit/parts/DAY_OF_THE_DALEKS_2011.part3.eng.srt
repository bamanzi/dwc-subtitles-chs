1
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:53,563
Get back! Get back!

2
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:54,907
Please! Wait! I've got to talk to you!

3
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:55,934
Keep away!

4
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,923
Exterminate!

5
00:26:58,309 --> 00:26:59,754
_ or you'll be caught in the time field!

6
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:20,095
We warned you.

7
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:22,508
Yes, yes, so you did.

8
00:27:22,677 --> 00:27:26,514
This may come as a shock to you, but you've just
travelled two hundred years through time.

9
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:32,471
Thank you. But I'm probably more familiar
with the concept of time travel than you are.

10
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:36,347
Now wait a minute. Before the time transference,
I saw a Dalek.

11
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:37,958
You know of the Daleks?

12
00:27:38,111 --> 00:27:42,096
Indeed I do. I know them only too well.
They've been my bitterest enemy for many years.

13
00:27:42,281 --> 00:27:44,193
Then you're a fool to have let yourself be brought here!

14
00:27:44,338 --> 00:27:46,617
Look, I came here in order to find Miss Jo Grant.

15
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:48,607
I told you, she's probably dead.

16
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:49,955
But as long as there's a chance...

17
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:51,048
Come on, Anat.

18
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,968
Wait a minute - what is my best way of finding her?

19
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:54,015
That's your problem.

20
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:55,223
We can't just leave him!

21
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,305
I can - come!

22
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:00,873
Run, Doctor - run!/

23
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:02,889
Report!

24
00:29:03,257 --> 00:29:06,585
The security guards have combed the tunnels.
They've found nothing.

25
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:10,056
You have failed the Daleks! You will be punished!

26
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:14,224
The fault is not mine! Your security guards let them get away.

27
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:18,161
- Those creatures are useless!
- They are loyal to the Daleks.

28
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:22,232
As loyal as they are stupid!
They will never be a match for human guerillas.

29
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:26,083
No one can succeed who opposes the Daleks.

30
00:29:26,253 --> 00:29:29,183
For every guerilla cell that you destroy,
another one springs up.

30
00:29:29,293 --> 00:29:31,483
They have stolen your time machines and copied them.

30
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:33,683
They steal your weapons, your explosives.

31
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:38,459
These criminals will be exterminated.
The Daleks will destroy them.

32
00:29:38,615 --> 00:29:41,602
If only you would let me
recruit more human security guards...

33
00:29:41,826 --> 00:29:44,311
Humans are treacherous and unreliable!

34
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,592
Not all humans. I have served you faithfully.

35
00:29:48,771 --> 00:29:52,572
Do not dispute with the Daleks!
Obey without question!

36
00:29:53,870 --> 00:30:58,702
Very well. There was one... curious thing.

36
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:04,902
The girl referred to a companion in her own time zone.
She called him... "the Doctor".

37
00:30:05,073 --> 00:30:07,418
Doctor?! Did you say "Doctor"?!

38
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:10,983
He appears to have got through to our time.
He was seen by the guards.

39
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:18,409
The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks!
He must be found at once and exterminated!

40
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:41,518
Don't gloss over it, Anat, we failed!

41
00:30:41,684 --> 00:30:44,115
We had no choice once our plan was known to them.

42
00:30:44,304 --> 00:30:46,532
If you'd listened to me, we still could have done what was needed.

43
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,534
We did all we could!

44
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:51,561
Monia, our orders were to eliminate Styles, right?

45
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:52,647
Yes, but you failed.

46
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:53,599
We could have succeeded.

47
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:54,582
Then why didn't you?

48
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,924
He wasn't there! Security guards found us.

49
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:58,422
But Anat went soft.

50
00:30:58,566 --> 00:30:59,303
Be quiet.

51
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:00,547
The trouble with you, Boaz is...

52
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:04,401
Both of you! We have to think now.
The situation is different.

53
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,980
As I see it, it's exactly the same -
we still have a job to do.

54
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:12,146
No. There may be other ways.
I've had a report from one of our contacts.

54
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:15,546
A girl has been captured.
They're holding her prisoner at the control centre.

55
00:31:15,714 --> 00:31:19,001
The same girl - the one who operated
the time module at Styles' house?

56
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:20,363
It fits your description.

57
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:22,230
Well, at least she's alive.

58
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:25,156
In the hands of the Daleks? She won't live long.

59
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:26,409
Can she tell them anything?

60
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:29,234
Nothing of importance.
Have they picked up that Doctor yet?

61
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:33,330
Not yet. It's only a matter of time.

62
00:31:33,537 --> 00:31:37,149
Move! Move! Come along there, you scum!

63
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:46,289
Move! Come along there, move! Move! Go on!

64
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:57,134
Well?

65
00:31:57,402 --> 00:32:01,022
Been captured. Taken for processing.
We must rescue him.

66
00:32:01,194 --> 00:32:03,352
Rescue him? Are you mad?! From there?

67
00:32:03,475 --> 00:32:05,239
I say we must!

68
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:07,069
Suicide.

69
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:09,196
Are you afraid?

70
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:15,203
Me? Of course I am. I'm not a fool.
What is he to us?

71
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:18,183
We have fresh information from
one of our contacts at control centre.

71
00:32:18,265 --> 00:32:22,483
He is the sworn enemy of the Daleks.
He is the one man they're afraid of - don't you see?

71
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:26,783
It's our only hope. If we don't act quickly,
it may be too late.

72
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:33,234
You are the Doctor! You are an enemy of the Daleks!

72
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:37,634
Now you are in our power! You will be exterminated!

73
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:45,232
You will be exterminated! You will be exterminated!
You will be exterminated! You will be exterminated!
