1
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:51,887
Stop! You mustn't kill him!
停下！你们不能杀了他！

2
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:54,800
- <i>Be silent.</i>
- Don't you realise he can help us?

00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:58,357
<i>The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks.</i>
博士是 Daleks 的敌人

4
00:32:58,447 --> 00:33:00,244
<i>How can he help us?</i>
他怎么可能帮助我们？

5
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:03,524
He is our contact with the guerrillas.
He has valuable information.
他是我们与游击队的联系人, 有宝贵的信息

6
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,883
<i>- You have proof of this?</i>
- I know he's working for them.
- 你有证据吗？  - 我知道他在为他们工作

7
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:11,677
<i>We will force the truth from him</i>
<i>with the mind analysis machine.</i>
我们可以把真相逼出来, 对他使用思维分析器

8
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:13,246
But look at him!
看看他！

9
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:16,603
You've practically killed him just
getting a simple admission of identity.
你们几乎把他弄死了, 他也才坦白承认他的身份而已

10
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:18,803
He'll die before he tells you anything else.
他在告诉你们任何其它事情之前, 就会死掉了

11
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:20,798
<i>What is your plan?</i>
你的计划是什么？

12
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:23,681
Let me interrogate him.
让我来审讯他

13
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,917
<i>Why should you be more successful?</i>
你凭什么就能更成功？

14
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:28,919
Because I understand human psychology.

15
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,759
I shall be able to gain his confidence.
我将能得到他的信任

16
00:33:30,847 --> 00:33:32,838
To put pressure on him through the girl.
通过那个女孩儿来给他施加压力

17
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,282
By the time I have finished with him,
我跟他一结束

18
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:39,679
I shall be able to crush the guerrilla
organisation entirely!
我就可以游击队整个碾压掉了！

19
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:41,126
<i>Release him.</i>
放了他

20
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:47,776
Now, the control centre is here.
好了, 这就是控制中心

21
00:33:47,947 --> 00:33:51,064
As far as we know, they're being held
prisoner in this block here.
就我们所知, 他们把俘虏扣押在这个区域

22
00:33:51,187 --> 00:33:52,381
And how do we get through?
那我们怎么进去？

23
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:55,061
The disused underground railway of the old city.
旧城废弃的地下铁路

24
00:33:55,147 --> 00:33:56,865
There's an exit right by this wall.
那边墙边有个出口

25
00:33:57,027 --> 00:33:59,416
I know the Doctor would help you if he could.
我知道博士会尽力帮助你

26
00:33:59,507 --> 00:34:02,943
I am trying to help him!
I've already saved his life.

27
00:34:03,027 --> 00:34:04,176
Yes, for your own purposes.
是的, 为了你自己的目的

28
00:34:04,267 --> 00:34:08,465
Look, if you do not tell me where they operate from,
what their plans are,
听着, 如果你不告诉我他们在哪里运作, 计划是什么

29
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:12,063
then the Daleks will destroy both of you.
那 Dalek 就是消灭你们两个

30
00:34:13,147 --> 00:34:14,785
I don't doubt it.
我不怀疑

31
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:16,825
Do you value life so little?
你如此轻视生命吗？

32
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:18,977
On the contrary, I value it enormously.
恰恰相反, 我非常珍视它

33
00:34:20,507 --> 00:34:22,543
The Daleks will kill us whatever we tell you.
不管我们告诉你什么, Dalek 都会杀了我们

34
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,185
Not if you cooperate with them.
如果你们跟他们合作的话, 就不会

35
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:26,656
As you cooperate with them?
像你一样跟他们合作？

36
00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:28,624
Do you really think that makes any difference?
你真觉得这有什么不同？

37
00:34:28,707 --> 00:34:31,904
- They can be reasonable!
- Reasonable?
- 他们不是讲理的？  - 讲理？

38
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,182
They tolerate you as long as you're useful to them.
他们容忍你, 是你对他们还有用

39
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:36,178
I am a senior government official.
我是政府高官

40
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:39,100
You, sir, you, sir, are a traitor!
你, 先生, 你, 是一名叛徒！

41
00:34:39,187 --> 00:34:40,224
You're a Quisling!
你是卖国贼！

42
00:34:40,307 --> 00:34:42,218
You do not understand!
你并不明白！

43
00:34:42,307 --> 00:34:44,867
We have helped make things better for the others.
我们帮忙让别人过得更好

44
00:34:44,987 --> 00:34:48,263
We have gained concessions. I have saved lives!
我们获得了 Dalek 的妥协, 我拯救了生命！

45
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:51,896
Wouldn't you have helped more
by organising the fight against them?
如果你组织人跟他们斗, 不是会帮助更多人吗？

46
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:54,421
No one can fight against the Daleks.
没人能跟 Dalek 斗

47
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:57,704
That's not what your criminal guerrillas
seem to think, is it?
你那些游击队罪犯可不这么想, 是吧？

48
00:34:57,787 --> 00:35:00,062
A handful of fanatics?
那群疯子？

49
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:02,900
Most of them have been killed already.
他们的大多数都已经被杀了

50
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:08,141
I assure you, there is nothing
they can do to change things.

- Anat, look out!
- 终结！终结！终结！  - Anat, 小心!

Come! We must reach the control centre, come!
快, 我们必须赶到控制中心, 来！

53
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,297
No! Come! Come!
不, 快, 快！

54
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:53,239
For the last time, I tell you
I haven't got any information.
最后一次我跟你说, 我没有任何信息

55
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:55,719
And quite frankly, even if I had,
I wouldn't give it to you!
而且非常坦白地说, 即使我有, 也不会给你！

56
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:57,286
- Right, stay where you are!  - Guards!
- 好, 待着别动！  - 警卫！

57
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:59,676
Guards? You have no guards. They're all dead.
警卫？你没有警卫了, 他们都死了

58
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:01,359
- Are you all right?  - Yes, thank you.
- 你没事吧？  - 是的, 谢谢你

00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:03,961
- All the better for seeing you.
- You're coming with us.
- 见到你们太好了  - 你们跟我们走

60
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:06,277
No harm must come to these two.
Too much depends on them.
保护好他们俩不受伤, 太多事情取决于他们

61
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:09,439
- As for you, my friend...
- Put that gun down!
- 至于你, 我的朋友...  - 把枪放下！

62
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:11,686
There's no point in murdering him.
杀了他没有意义

63
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:13,405
You don't know how much blood
there is on his hands.
你不知道他手上有多少血

64
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:15,125
Nevertheless, he's not your real enemy.
不管怎样, 他不是你们真正的敌人

65
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:17,437
He's helped the Daleks. He's worked for them!
他在帮 Dalek, 他为他们工作！

66
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:20,121
They would always have found someone.
他们总是能找到一个人的

67
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:21,196
Now, just leave him.
现在, 留下他吧

68
00:36:24,127 --> 00:36:25,719
Right, let's go.
好了, 我们走

69
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:42,762
- But how do you know this?
- Oh, there are books.
- 但你们怎么知道这个  - 哦, 有书啊

70
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:45,645
Even during the wars, people found time
to study, to write about it.
就是在战争期间, 人们还是能找到时间研究、记录这事

71
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:48,241
What to you has not yet happened
is to us history.
对于你们还没有发生的事情, 对于我们已经是历史了

72
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:51,595
This history of yours,
it talks about Sir Reginald Styles?
你们的这个历史, 它说到了 Reginald Styles 爵士？

73
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:53,637
Oh, yeah, he pretended to be working for peace,
哦, 是的, 他假装为和平而工作

74
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:55,279
but really he just wanted power for himself.
但实际上他只是为他自己争取权力

75
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:57,278
So the conference he called was just a trick?
所以他召集的会议只是一个诡计？

76
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:59,881
He managed to lure the world leaders to
a remote country house
他设法把各国领导人骗到一个偏远的乡村房子里

77
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:03,516
and he pretended they needed absolute quiet
if the meeting was to succeed.
然后假装说他们需要绝对的安静, 否则会议没法成功

78
00:37:03,607 --> 00:37:05,996
But then, there was a devastating explosion...
但是接下来, 就发生了一场毁灭性的爆炸...

79
00:37:06,087 --> 00:37:08,157
And Styles was killed with the others.
然后 Styles 就跟其他人一起炸死了

80
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:10,397
He must have set a bomb and mistimed the charge.
他肯定是安放了一个炸弹, 但把时间设错了

81
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:12,762
There were accusations, counter-accusations,
然后就出现了指控、反指控

82
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:15,759
and then the wars began. That was the turning point.
战争就爆发了, 那就成了转折点

83
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:19,681
But if this true, Sir Reginald Styles
must be completely round the bend!
但如果这是真的, Reginald Styles 爵士一定完全气疯了！

84
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:22,281
Er, so, you went back into our time
呃, 所以, 你们就回到我们的时间点

85
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,642
to kill Styles before he could carry out his plan?
就为了在 Styles 实施他的计划之前杀死他？

86
00:37:24,727 --> 00:37:26,797
Right. We've been fighting the Daleks for years.
对, 我们跟 Dalek 斗了很多年

87
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:27,876
But it was hopeless.
但没什么希望

88
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:31,039
Eventually we must lose,
so we thought, what else can we do?
最终我们必然会输, 于是我们想, 我们还能做什么？

89
00:37:31,127 --> 00:37:32,480
We learnt through one of our spies
我们通过一个间谍了解到

90
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:35,400
that the Daleks had succeeded
in creating a time machine.
Dalek 成功创造了一种时间机器

91
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:39,162
We even managed to steal a copy of
the plans, and we built one of our own,
我们甚至设法偷了一份设计图, 自己造了一台

92
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:42,125
so that we could go back
into history to the exact point
以便我们可以回到历史中的确切时间点

93
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:45,405
With one action, we could stop them.
只要一次行动, 我们就可以阻止他们

94
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:47,842
Mankind could have a chance
to take a new direction!
人类就有了一个机会走向新的方向！

95
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:50,157
But even now, the transfer isn't always stable.
但即使到现在, 时间转移并不总是稳定

96
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:53,478
People materialised in your time
and then just faded away.
人在你们的时间出现, 然后又慢慢消失

97
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:54,636
The ghost that Styles saw?
Styles 看到的那个鬼魂？

98
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:57,560
Somehow, somehow the Daleks
found what we were doing.
不知怎地, Dalek 发现了我们在做什么

99
00:37:57,647 --> 00:38:01,401
And they sent Ogrons back into your time
after us and attacked one of our men.
他们派 Orgon 回到你们的时间追杀我们, 袭击了我们一个人

100
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,559
Well, that must have been the man
that we saw down by the canal tunnel.
哦, 那肯定就是在运河隧道边看见的那个人

101
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:06,763
You remember, Jo, the one who vanished
from the ambulance?
你还记得吗, Jo, 在救护车上消失的那个人？

102
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:08,724
Yes, we fixed on the tunnel
是的, 我们锁定了那个隧道

103
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:11,367
as a place that was stable
in your time and in ours.
那是在你们和我们的时间都稳定的一个地点

104
00:38:11,447 --> 00:38:14,644
We used it as a transfer point.
Well, you know the rest.
我们把它用作了传送点, 喏, 剩下的你们都知道了

105
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,995
Yes, well there's... There's one thing
I don't quite understand and that is
是的, 不过还有...还有一件事情我不太明白, 那就是

106
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,997
why were you so keen to rescue us?
And believe me, we're grateful, but...
你们为什么这么热衷于救我们？相信我, 我很感激, 但是...

107
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:24,281
Well, you told us yourself,
you're an old enemy of the Daleks.
哦, 你自己跟我们说过, 你是 Dalek 的老敌人

108
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:26,556
- Yes?
- Then you will help us to beat them.
- 是吗？  - 而且你会帮助我们打败他们

109
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:28,886
What do you expect me to do?
你们期望我做什么？

110
00:38:28,967 --> 00:38:31,435
Well, you can succeed where we've failed, Doctor.
就是, 在我们失败的地方获得成功, 博士

111
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:35,719
We want you to go back into your
own time and kill Styles.
我们期望你回到你的时间, 杀了 Styles

112
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:39,399
You're asking me to commit murder!
你们要求我去实施谋杀？

113
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:43,400
No! We're asking you to kill one man
and prevent millions more dying.
不！我们是在要求你去杀一人而救千千万万

114
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,682
- That is still murder.
- Isn't it worth it?
- 那还是谋杀  - 这样不值得吗？

115
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:48,156
- To save the human race from the Daleks?
- Yes, but would it?
- 就能从 Dalek 手中把人类救出来？  - 是的, 但能吗？

116
00:38:48,247 --> 00:38:50,078
We've told you how it happened.
我们告诉你们了, 这一切是怎么开始的

117
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:52,886
But your history could be wrong, you know.
但你们的历史可能是错的, 你知道吗？

118
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:57,643
Now, listen, why don't you
send us back to our time?
现在, 听着, 为什么你不把我们送回我们的时间？

119
00:38:57,727 --> 00:38:59,922
We know the future now,
maybe there are other things we can do?
我们现在已经知道了未来, 也许有其它事情我们可以做？

120
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,884
Monia, we're wasting valuable time!
Every minute that goes by...
Monia, 我们在浪费宝贵的时间！每流逝一分钟...

121
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,527
Doctor, will you help us? It's our only hope.
博士, 你会帮助我们吗？这是我们唯一的希望

122
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:08,361
I still can't believe that Sir Reginald
Styles is a ruthless murderer.
我还是无法相信 Reginald 爵士是一个冷血杀手

123
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:10,039
Yes, I agree, Jo.
是的, 我同意, Jo

124
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:12,277
Vain to the point of arrogance,
a trifle obstinate, perhaps,
要说有点虚荣傲慢，在小事上固执，也许有点

125
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,676
but basically a good man.
但基本上还是个好人

126
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:19,885
So, if it happened, how did it happen?
所以, 如果那事发生了, 是怎么发生的呢？

127
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:25,237
Any of your people still in our time zone?
你们还有人在我们的时间区域吗？

128
00:39:25,327 --> 00:39:27,841
- No.  - Well, Shura.
- 没有  - 对了，Shura

129
00:39:27,927 --> 00:39:30,999
He left just to send a message and
we never saw nor heard from him again.
他离开我们去送一个信息, 我们就再也没有看到他, 没听到他

130
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:32,406
We assumed he must be dead.

I'm completely with you about the ends.

132
00:39:57,327 --> 00:39:59,081
I only disagree as to the means.
我只是不同意中间的手段

133
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:02,401
All right. What do you want to know?
好吧, 你想知道什么？

134
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:07,523
This mission of yours to the 20th century,
what did you take with you?
你们这次到20世纪的任务, 你们都带了什么东西过去？

It's a highly effective type of explosive.
