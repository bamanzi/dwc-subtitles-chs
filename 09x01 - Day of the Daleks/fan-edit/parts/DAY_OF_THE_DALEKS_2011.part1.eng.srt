1
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:11,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:33,947
What the...?

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Day of the Daleks

4
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:16,051
Doctor, why don't you take a break?

5
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,615
It's maddening, you know. So nearly there.

5
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,615
If I could only cut out their override
on the dematerialisation circuit.

5
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,915
Let me see those figures.

6
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:31,313
Doctor?

7
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:33,369
I thought the TARDIS was working again.

8
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:34,612
What gave you that idea?

9
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:39,175
Oh, being dragged off to an alien planet
five hundred years in the future, for example.

9
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:41,575
Oh, you know - all that business
with the miners and the colonists.

10
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:46,332
My dear Jo, the TARDIS was being operated then under
remote control by the High Council of the Time Lords.

11
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:47,442
Well, if it worked for them...

12
00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:50,789
I don't want it to work for them.
I want it to work for me.

12
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:53,889
No-one's going to turn me into
an interplanetary puppet.

13
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,857
Yes, of course. Why didn't I think of that before?

14
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:13,182
Yes, of course. I remember now.

15
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:17,773
Look, don't worry, my dear. I know you're alarmed but you needn't be.

16
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:21,441
Yes, well I think that should do it. Why on Earth I never realised that...

17
00:02:21,783 --> 00:02:23,420
Oh no! What are you doing here?

18
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:24,590
Well, I'm not here. Don't worry.

18
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:31,190
Well, that is, in a sense, er, I am here,
but, erm, you are not there.

18
00:02:31,294 --> 00:02:34,290
Er... yes, well, it's a bit difficult
to explain really.

19
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:37,279
This won't do at all!
We can't have two of us running about.

20
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:39,341
Yes, well don't worry. It will all sor...

21
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,531
Doctor! What happened?

22
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:47,536
Well, it's a very complicated thing - time - Jo.

22
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:51,536
Once you've begun tampering with it,
the oddest things start happening.

23
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,917
But there was another you and another... me.

24
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,531
Well, where've they gone?

25
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:59,620
Back into their own time stream, of course.
Or do I mean forward?

26
00:02:59,631 --> 00:03:01,250
But, Doctor, I don't understand...

27
00:03:01,262 --> 00:03:05,233
Look, Jo. Don't worry about it. It was a freak
affect. It's very unlikely to happen again.

28
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:06,967
Hold that and give me those papers.

29
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:12,972
Ah, Doctor. Glad you're still here.

30
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,965
I need your help.

31
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,280
Sorry, Brigadier. I'm busy.

32
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:22,097
Yeah, so am I, Doctor, so am I. Now then,
you've heard of Sir Reginald Styles?

33
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,622
No, can't say that I have.

34
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:25,970
Well isn't he the chief representative at the UN?

35
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:28,322
That's right - key figure at the latest
summit conference.

36
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:30,537
My dear chap, I'm a scientist. Not a politician.

37
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:35,229
You know, Doctor, if you... didn't spend so much time
tinkering around with this wretched contraption,

37
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,629
you'd realise just how bad
the international situation's become.

38
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:39,966
Humans are always squabbling over something, Brigadier.

39
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:43,725
Yes, well, this particular squabble looks like
ending up in a third world war.

40
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:48,197
The Chinese delegation have refused to attend.
Without them, the conference can't even begin.

40
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:52,797
Now Styles is flying to Peking in a few hours.
There's just a chance that he can persuade them to change their minds.

41
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:55,926
All right, Brigadier. So what's his problem?

42
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,706
Well, he was working late last night,
down at Auderly...

43
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,700
Where's that?

44
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:04,392
Auderly, Miss Grant, is a Government owned country house
about fifty miles north of London where the conference is due to be held.

45
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:05,422
Oh.

46
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:11,113
He suddenly started behaving... rather oddly.
Seemed to think that someone was trying to assassinate him.

47
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,077
Any idea who?

48
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:13,929
Some sort of "ghost" apparently.

49
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,686
He said somebody attacked him and vanished.

50
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:29,643
And you're absolutely certain that he used the word "ghost"?

51
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:32,633
Oh yes. But afterwards he...

52
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:35,238
Miss Paget! What's going on here?!

53
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:37,242
These people are from UNIT, sir.

54
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:38,307
Who asked them to come here?

55
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:40,213
I did - because of what happened yesterday.

56
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:42,163
Nothing happened yesterday.

57
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,677
There seems to have been some sort of incident,
Sir Reginald?

58
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:45,819
Nothing of any importance.

59
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,868
Well, if you could tell us what happened?

60
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:51,531
I was working late. I must have dropped off.

60
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:56,531
Freak gust of wind, blew some papers off my desk,
I woke up rather confused,

60
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,231
I was picking up the papers when Miss Paget came in.

61
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:00,123
But you did mention ghosts.

62
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:02,728
Did I? Must have been having a nightmare.

63
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,524
But the French windows were shut. I closed them before I went to bed.

64
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:07,594
Then I must have opened them!

65
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:12,492
Did you, er, did you also make
those marks on the floor over there?

65
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:17,492
Muddy feet, Sir Reginald. Someone was in here, you know.

66
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:18,916
Are you accusing me of lying, sir?!

67
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:24,142
Sir Reginald, you've obviously been under considerable
strain recently. Were you feeling at all unwell last night?

68
00:05:24,243 --> 00:05:27,225
I felt, and feel, perfectly well.

68
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:30,825
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've a lot to do.
I'm due at the airport in an hour.

69
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:32,468
You've no objection to my men searching the grounds?

70
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,250
None at all. Though I really don't know
what you hope to find.

71
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,195
Sergeant!

72
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,699
Ah, he's in a bad way, poor chap.
You'd better get him to the hospital.

73
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:51,140
Captain Yates...

74
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,242
Right away, sir.

75
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:58,981
This is a new one on me.
What do you make of it, Doctor?

76
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:03,257
I'm not sure...

77
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:04,033
Sir?

78
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,537
What've you got there, Benton?

79
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:07,827
No idea, sir.

80
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:10,539
It was hidden about fifty feet inside the tunnel. 

81
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:19,362
Have you seen this before?

82
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:22,786
Really Brigadier! What sort of games are you playing?

83
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:25,167
It's not a game, sir. It's our duty to protect you!

84
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:26,762
I don't need your protection!

85
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:31,495
Sir Reginald, we've just found a very severely
injured man down by the canal tunnel.

86
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:33,755
Oh really? And what did he look like?

87
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:38,923
Thirty-fiveish, average build. He was wearing
a sort of guerilla combat suit.

88
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,371
And carrying that gun.

89
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:45,596
I am very sorry, gentlemen, but I have rather more important
things on my mind at the moment. If you'll excuse me?

90
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:47,447
I've arranged an escort to take you to the airport, sir.

91
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,908
Thank you, but it shouldn't be necessary.

92
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:50,500
I'm sorry, sir, but I think it will!

93
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:51,831
Oh, if you insist.

94
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,712
I'd like to get that gun down to the laboratory
and run a few tests on it.

95
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:05,162
Well, basically it's a form of ultra-sonic disintegrator.

96
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,361
You mean a ray gun?

97
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:08,514
That's right, Jo, I mean a ray gun. 

97
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:13,214
Only it's far more sophisticated than any weapon
yet invented on Earth. Now take a look at this.

98
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:19,825
Quite an effective little weapon, eh?

99
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:25,472
Doctor, you say this wasn't made on Earth.
Do you mean it comes from another planet?

100
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,479
Well that was my theory at first, yes.

100
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,779
But the metallurgical analysis shows that the,
er, iron constituent is very much of this world./32.8

100
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,579
In fact, it was mined not very far from here - North Wales.

101
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:37,561
How do you explain that?

102
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:41,880
Do you believe in ghosts, Brigadier?

103
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,047
Let's be serious, Doctor.

104
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:43,952
I am.

105
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:45,592
Oh, come along, Doctor, come along.

106
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:50,514
Oh, my mistake. I was forgetting
the unimaginative nature of the military mind.

106
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:54,014
But we saw a couple of "Amicus Seperatus"
a few moments ago, didn't we, Jo?

107
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:55,002
Did we?

108
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:56,525
Yes, here in this laboratory.

109
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:57,785
Oh, you mean when we...

110
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,497
Mind you, they were manifestations
of a much more benevolent kind.

110
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,997
None of your clanking chains and chilly fingers!
But ghosts, none the less.

111
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,742
That was because you were playing around
with the time mechanism on the TARDIS, wasn't it?

112
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,734
Still can't get it to work, eh?

113
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:18,388
Well, I can't get this thing to work, either.
But this is a form of, er, of time machine of a very crude kind.

114
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:19,735
How do you know?

115
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,105
Come over here. Look at this.

116
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:23,958
Now what do you think that is?

117
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,685
Ooh, it's a... mini-dematerialisation circuit.

118
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:29,653
Top of the class, Jo.
Now then, pop this in here, like that.

119
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,950
Now, as far as I can gather,
when you push this button, it should...

120
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:36,437
Good grief! It's working!

121
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:46,698
Sir?

122
00:08:47,182 --> 00:08:48,055
What is it?

123
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:51,092
Time transmitter in operation, sir.
Twentieth Century Zone.

124
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:53,365
Can you fix the space-time coordinates?

125
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:54,853
Do be careful, Doctor!

126
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,682
All right, Jo, all right.

127
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:57,605
Well?

128
00:08:58,127 --> 00:09:02,208
No good, sir. There was a transference,
I think, but the machine's cut out completely.

129
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:07,234
Continue scanning - and next time
you had better be more efficient!

130
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,417
Report!

131
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:16,695
Yes, I see. All right, sergeant.  You'd better
report back to Captain Yates. Goodbye.

132
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:19,807
That was Benton. He was in the ambulance
with the man we found.

133
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:20,920
Well?

134
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:27,999
Well according to him, that man just...
vanished, faded away - like a ghost.

135
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:29,246
Oh no!

136
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:30,904
Well, Doctor, what now?

137
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:34,166
Well, everything that happens seems to
centre round Styles' house.

138
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:35,532
Obviously.

139
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:37,604
And whoever tried to harm him will probably try again.

140
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:43,940
Jo, how would you like to spend the night
in a haunted house?

141
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:08,846
Wake up, Jo.

142
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:10,678
It's all right. It's morning.

143
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,052
Nothing's happened?

144
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:13,175
No, nothing at all.

145
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:50,901
Jo! Jo!

146
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:34,224
Please! Turn that machine off
- or they'll kill all of us! Please!

147
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:40,237
Sir?

148
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:41,219
Yes?

149
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:43,492
We've picked up that time transmitter again.

150
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:44,377
You're sure?

151
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:48,166
Yes, sir. Same frequency, same time...
time zone. Much stronger now.

152
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,427
Right. I want the exact space-time co-ordinates
so whatever happens, don't lose it!

153
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,300
What is your report?

154
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,436
We have a fix on the time transfer device.

154
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:07,436
It is operating again in the twentieth century
time zone and it must be them.

155
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:13,131
You have obtained the space-time co-ordinates?

156
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:17,819
We're trying now. The trace is much stronger
this time. There is every chance...

157
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:19,626
You must not fail!

158
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:27,778
Security forces are standing by. If we do get
the co-ordinates, what are your instructions?

159
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:36,737
Whoever is operating the time machine
is an enemy of the Daleks.

159
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:45,137
All enemies of the Daleks must be destroyed!
Exterminate them!
