405
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:53,563
Get back! Get back!
回去！回去！

406
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:54,907
Please! Wait! I've got to talk to you!
拜托，等等！我要跟你们谈谈！

407
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:55,934
Keep away!
走开！

408
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,923
Exterminate!
终结！

409
00:26:58,309 --> 00:26:59,754
_ or you'll be caught in the time field!

410
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:20,095
We warned you.
我们警告过你

411
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:22,508
Yes, yes, so you did.
是的，是的，是这样

412
00:27:22,677 --> 00:27:26,514
This may come as a shock to you, but you've just
travelled two hundred years through time.
有一点可能会让你感到震惊, 但你刚刚穿越了两百年的时间

413
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:32,471
Thank you. But I'm probably more familiar
with the concept of time travel than you are.
谢谢。但我可能比你更熟悉时间旅行的概念

414
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:36,447
Now wait a minute. 
Before the time transference, I saw a Dalek.
现在等一下，在时间转移之前, 我看到了一个 Dalek

415
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,958
- You know of the Daleks?  - Indeed I do.
- 你知道 Dalek ？ - 我确实知道

416
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:42,296
I know them only too well. 
They've been my bitterest enemy for many years.
我太了解他们了。他们多年来一直是我最痛苦的敌人

417
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:44,193
Then you're a fool to have
let yourself be brought here!
那你让自己被带到这里来，就太傻了

418
00:27:44,338 --> 00:27:46,617
Look, I came here in order to find Miss Jo Grant.
听着，我来这里是为了找到 Jo Geant 小姐

419
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:48,607
I told you, she's probably dead.
我告诉过你, 她可能已经死了

420
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:49,955
But as long as there's a chance...
但只要还有一线可能...

421
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:51,048
Come on, Anat.
快点，Anat

422
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,968
Wait a minute - what is my best way of finding her?
等一下 - 我找到她的最好方法是什么？

423
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:54,015
That's your problem.
那是你的问题

424
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:55,223
We can't just leave him!
我们不能抛下他！

425
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,305
I can - come!
我能 - 走！

426
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:00,873
Run, Doctor - run!
跑，博士 - 快跑！

427
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:02,889
Report!
汇报！

428
00:29:03,257 --> 00:29:06,585
The security guards have combed the tunnels.
They've found nothing.
保安已经对隧道进行了排查。他们什么也没发现

429
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:10,056
You have failed the Daleks!
You will be punished!
你辜负了 Dalek! 你将会受到惩罚!

430
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:14,224
The fault is not mine!
Your security guards let them get away.
错不是我的! 你们的警卫让他们跑了

431
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:18,161
- Those creatures are useless!
- They are loyal to the Daleks.
- 那些生物一点用没有!  - 他们对 Dalek 很忠诚

432
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:22,232
As loyal as they are stupid!
They will never be a match for human guerillas.
同样也很愚蠢! 他们永远不会是人类游击队的对手

433
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:26,083
No one can succeed who opposes the Daleks.
跟 Dalek 作对的人没一个成功

434
00:29:26,253 --> 00:29:29,183
For every guerilla cell that you destroy,
another one springs up.
你每消灭一个游击队成员, 另一个又站起来了

435
00:29:29,293 --> 00:29:31,483
They have stolen your time machines
and copied them.
他们偷了你们的时间机器, 还复制了它们

436
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:33,683
They steal your weapons, your explosives.
他们偷了你们的武器，你们的炸药

437
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:38,459
These criminals will be exterminated.
The Daleks will destroy them.
这些罪犯将会被终结。Dalek 将摧毁他们

438
00:29:38,615 --> 00:29:41,602
If only you would let me recruit 
more human security guards...
要是你们能让我招募更多的人类保安就好了...

439
00:29:41,826 --> 00:29:44,311
Humans are treacherous and unreliable!
人类都很狡猾，不可靠!

440
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,592
Not all humans. I have served you faithfully.
并非所有人这样，我就一直忠实地为你们服务

441
00:29:48,771 --> 00:29:52,572
Do not dispute with the Daleks!
Obey without question!
不要与 Dalek 争辩! 毫无疑问地服从!

442
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,702
Very well. There was one... curious thing.
好吧。有一件...奇特的事情

443
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,502
The girl referred to a companion in her own time zone.
那个女孩提到她那个时区的一个同伴

444
00:30:02,712 --> 00:30:04,902
She called him... "the Doctor".
她称呼他为...“博士”

445
00:30:05,073 --> 00:30:07,418
Doctor?! Did you say "Doctor"?!
博士?! 你刚才是说了“博士”吗？

446
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:10,983
He appears to have got through to our time.
He was seen by the guards.
他似乎也穿越到我们这个时代了, 警卫看见他了

447
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:18,409
The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks!
He must be found at once and exterminated!
博士是 Dalek 的敌人！必须立刻找到他, 予以终结！

448
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:41,518
Don't gloss over it, Anat, we failed!
别掩饰了, Anat, 我们失败了！

449
00:30:41,684 --> 00:30:44,115
We had no choice once our plan was known to them.
一旦我们的计划被他们所知晓, 我们就没有选择了

450
00:30:44,304 --> 00:30:46,532
If you'd listened to me,
we still could have done what was needed.
如果你当初听我的, 我们可能已经完成所需要做的了

451
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,534
We did all we could!
我们已经尽了我们所能！

452
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:51,561
Monia, our orders were to eliminate Styles, right?
Monia, 我们的命令是消灭 Styles, 对吧？

453
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:52,647
Yes, but you failed.
是的, 但你失败了

454
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:53,599
We could have succeeded.
我们本来可以胜利的

455
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:54,582
Then why didn't you?
那为什么你们没有？

456
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,924
He wasn't there! Security guards found us.
他不在那里！保安队又找到了我们

457
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:58,422
But Anat went soft.
但是 Anat 心软了

458
00:30:58,566 --> 00:30:59,303
Be quiet.
闭嘴

459
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:00,547
The trouble with you, Boaz is...
你的问题，Boaz，是...

460
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:04,401
Both of you! We have to think now.
The situation is different.
你俩都闭嘴！我们必须得想想了，处境不同了

461
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,980
As I see it, it's exactly the same -
we still have a job to do.
就我所见，完全一样，我们还是有活要干

462
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:12,146
No. There may be other ways.
I've had a report from one of our contacts.
不，可能有其它的路子。我收到一个线人的报告

463
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:15,546
A girl has been captured.
They're holding her prisoner at the control centre.
他们抓住了一个女孩儿，正把她扣押在控制中心

464
00:31:15,714 --> 00:31:19,001
The same girl - the one who operated
the time module at Styles' house?
就那个女孩儿吗？就在 Styles 房子里打开了时间模块的那个？

465
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:20,363
It fits your description.
跟你的描述相符

466
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:22,230
Well, at least she's alive.
哦，至少她还活着

467
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:25,156
In the hands of the Daleks? She won't live long.
在 Dalek 的手上？她活不长了

468
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:26,409
Can she tell them anything?
她会给他们透露什么吗？

469
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:29,234
Nothing of importance.
Have they picked up that Doctor yet?
没什么重要的。他们已经找到了博士没有？

470
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:33,330
Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
还没有，不过只是时间的问题

471
00:31:33,537 --> 00:31:37,149
Move! Move! Come along there, you scum!
走！快走！到那边去，你们这些渣子

472
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:46,289
Move! Come along there, move! Move! Go on!
走！到那边去，走！继续！

473
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:57,134
Well?
怎样？

474
00:31:57,402 --> 00:32:01,022
Been captured. Taken for processing.
We must rescue him.
被抓住了，被带去处理。我们必须救他

475
00:32:01,194 --> 00:32:03,352
Rescue him? Are you mad?! From there?
救他？你疯了？到那儿去救？

476
00:32:03,475 --> 00:32:05,239
I say we must!
我说了必须！

477
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:07,069
Suicide.
自杀

478
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:09,196
Are you afraid?
你害怕了？

479
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:15,203
Me? Of course I am. I'm not a fool.
What is he to us?
我？当然害怕，我又不是傻子。他是我们什么人？

480
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:18,183
We have fresh information from
one of our contacts at control centre.
我们从控制中心的线人那里收到了新消息

481
00:32:18,265 --> 00:32:22,483
He is the sworn enemy of the Daleks.
He is the one man they're afraid of - don't you see?
他是 Dalek 的宿敌，是他们所害怕的一个人，你明白了吗？

482
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:26,783
It's our only hope. If we don't act quickly,
it may be too late.
这是我们仅有的希望。不过我们不赶紧行动, 恐怕就来不及了

483
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:33,234
You are the Doctor! You are an enemy of the Daleks!
你是博士！你是 Dalek 的敌人！

484
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:37,634
Now you are in our power! You will be exterminated!
现在你在我们手上了！你将被终结！

485
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:45,232
You will be exterminated! You will be exterminated!
You will be exterminated! You will be exterminated!
你将被终结！你将被终结！你将被终结！你将被终结！
