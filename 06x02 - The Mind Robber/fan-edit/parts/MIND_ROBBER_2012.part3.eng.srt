Oh, how much further?

2
00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:31,502
There's no sign of the toy soldiers now.

3
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:34,660
- We've got to get out of this place.
- Look.

4
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:36,944
There's a house.

5
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:40,147
Creag an tuire!

00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:43,698
- (FIRES)
- Jamie!

7
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:47,622
- Doctor!
- It's all right, Zoe.

8
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:53,022
Well, come on. If you want to play games,
let's get on with it.

10
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,467
What's that?

11
00:14:56,628 --> 00:15:00,098
I have to make up his face again.

12
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:02,498
- You did this before!
- Yes.

13
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,943
That's how Jamie's face got changed.

14
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:07,906
- You got it all wrong!
- What? No, no.

15
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:09,899
Well, I was rushed.

16
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:12,821
Now, then... There we are.

17
00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:16,303
All right, I know!

18
00:15:16,468 --> 00:15:17,947
There we are.

19
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:24,706
One... Now, then... Yes, that's his nose.
You can't mistake his nose, can you?

20
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,459
And...

00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:32,899

00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:36,104
There you are, you see!

23
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,498
Jamie! Thank goodness you're back.

24
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:42,138
- I haven't been anywhere.
- You've got your face back.

25
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,105
- I have?
- Yes. Look.

26
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:46,828
You're right, I have! That's much better.

27
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:51,061
- Ah! The house.
- Yes. Come along. Let's go inside.

- Hello there!
- (VOICE ECHOES)

32
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:21,899
One, two, three, four tunnels leading off.

33
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:25,265
- We could easily get lost in there.
- Just a moment.

34
00:16:25,428 --> 00:16:27,419
What's he found?

35
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:29,579
A ball of twine.

36
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:34,458
Hmm... Oh, yes...
This must have been an invitation.

37
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,619
Why?

38
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:41,862
It's the classical way of getting through a maze.
Tie that to the door, will you?

39
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:44,781
It's locked.

40
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:49,257
- Then we ARE meant to go on.
- Yes, I think we are.

41
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:54,821
But that means that wherever we go,
at any time, they know. They're expecting us.

42
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:58,617
Yes... Don't break the thread. Come along.

43
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:05,983
- Which way, do you think?
- To the right.

44
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:09,860
(DOCTOR) They look equally unattractive
to me.

45
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:13,020
It must be to the right.
I've been working it out.

46
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:14,985
- Doctor...
- Shh! How?

47
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:17,946
It soon fell into a clear pattern.

48
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:23,660
One left, two right, three left, four right
and so on. A simple arithmetical progression.

49
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:25,147
- Doctor...
- Shh!

50
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:28,823
What it is to have an arithmetical brain!
What do you want?

51
00:17:28,988 --> 00:17:31,866
The thread's run out. Should we not go back?

52
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:37,580
No. You stay here
and Zoe and I will explore a little further.

53
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:41,661
There must be another way out of this maze.
I need to find it.

54
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:47,784
They don't want us to find a way out,
only a way in!

(GLUGGING, DRIPPING)

56
00:18:06,948 --> 00:18:09,382
I was right. This isn't the way out.

57
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,539
We're in the middle of the maze.

58
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,825
- Doctor, I don't like it. Let's go.
- Just a moment.

59
00:18:14,988 --> 00:18:19,345
I was rather expecting a welcoming
committee, but perhaps I was wrong.

60
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:20,827
I hope you were!

61
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:23,866
Someone WAS here,
not so long ago either. Look!

00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:27,783
(BOTH) Oh!

63
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:30,337
There's some tracks of an animal too.

- It couldn't be!
- What?

66
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:43,147
I know it's silly, but do you remember
the story of the Minotaur?

67
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:46,106
Half-man, half-bull, yes.

68
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:48,907
And he lived in the heart of a labyrinth.

69
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:51,502
And there were human sacrifices!

70
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:55,502
Exactly, but I don't think
we need be too alarmed...

00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:09,487
- But it's there!
- No!

77
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,920
The Minotaur is a mythical beast. Say it!

78
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:16,364
The Minotaur is a mythical beast.
It doesn't exist!

(ROARING STOPS)

00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:20,559
It's gone!

00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:23,326
Yes.

82
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:27,959
I'm afraid we made it
too difficult for it to stay.

83
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:30,358
Come on. Let's go and find Jamie.

84
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:48,920
So that's how you can see, is it?

85
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:52,364
With that wee lighthouse of yours.

86
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:10,718
(MASTER) No! Brainless idiot.
Get yourself free. Don't let the boy escape!

87
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:46,717
- I think this is the place.
- Yes.

88
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:51,086
There's no sign of him.
I'm sure he wouldn't have gone off without...

89
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:53,318
- What's that?
- His jacket.

90
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:57,720
- Well, he must be around here somewhere.
- Jamie!

91
00:20:57,888 --> 00:20:59,207
Who's that?

92
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,403
- My dear sir!
- Your servant, sir.

93
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:06,038
- You keep turning up unexpectedly.
- Have you seen Jamie?

94
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:09,623
I walked alone
but saw no sign of any inhabitants.

95
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:14,100
- (ZOE) Are you positive?
- I would not impose any falsities upon you.

96
00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:16,862
- I adhere strictly to truth.
- Of course.

97
00:21:17,828 --> 00:21:21,582
This person who controls this place...

98
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,581
- The Master?
- The Master? Yes?

99
00:21:24,748 --> 00:21:26,227
Have you seen him?

100
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:29,778
Upon occasion he has been pleased
to grant me an audience.

101
00:21:30,828 --> 00:21:32,227
Where might I find him?

102
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:39,019
The Master's palace is a citadel,
a walled town at the top of a hill or cliff,

103
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:40,860
the highest in the kingdom.

104
00:21:41,028 --> 00:21:42,939
Now I think I understand.

105
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:47,738
May I ask, sir, where you come from?
Would it not be Nottingham?

106
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:52,698
My father had a small estate in Nottingham.
I was the third of five sons.

107
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:56,224
He sent me to Emmanuel College
in Cambridge at 14,

108
00:21:56,388 --> 00:22:00,745
where I applied myself
to learning navigation and mathematics...

109
00:22:00,908 --> 00:22:03,661
(BOTH) Useful for those who intend to travel,

110
00:22:03,828 --> 00:22:07,184
as I always believed
it would be my fortune to do.

111
00:22:07,348 --> 00:22:09,020
Now I know who you are, sir.

112
00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:12,498
- Your name is Lemuel Gulliver!
- Your servant, sir.

113
00:22:12,668 --> 00:22:14,340
- Gulliver?
- Yes.

114
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,466
Oh, no!

115
00:22:24,788 --> 00:22:28,383
I'd need to be a human fly to get up that lot.

116
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:32,097
I can't go back, though.
What I really need is a...

00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,027
Who says wishes don't come true?

118
00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:53,740
Ouch!

119
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:58,820
- I suppose you know that hurts?
- You mean this is your hair?

120
00:22:58,988 --> 00:23:04,062
Of course. I don't object to people climbing it -
I'm quite used to it, actually -

121
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:06,981
- but you would keep tugging so.
- I'm sorry.

122
00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:08,979
- Are you a prince?
- No. Why?

123
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:13,380
You're supposed to be.
I'm a princess, but I suppose you knew that.

124
00:23:13,548 --> 00:23:17,700
My name's Rapunzel. You're not
a woodcutter's son, by any chance?

125
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:21,224
- No. I'm the son of a piper.
- How very disappointing.

126
00:23:21,388 --> 00:23:23,026
You'd better go. Goodbye.

127
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:24,780
- Wait!
- Well?

128
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:30,500
I can't go back there. It's a sheer drop.
I'll have to climb in through the window.

129
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:34,343
- I don't know if that would be allowed.
- I won't stay long.

130
00:23:34,508 --> 00:23:36,897
Just passing through, you might say.

131
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:41,698
- Och, please.
- It's a great pity you're not a prince.

132
00:23:41,868 --> 00:23:44,018
You'd have made rather a good one.

133
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:46,861
Well, I suppose you'd better come inside.

134
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:49,542
For goodness' sake, be quiet.

135
00:23:56,828 --> 00:23:58,580
Rapunzel!

136
00:23:58,748 --> 00:24:01,057
Your Highness, where have you gone?

137
00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:03,867
Don't be silly. I'm not going...

138
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:09,261
Hey, this doesn't look like
the inside of a princess's castle to me.

139
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:17,382
but it would not be proper to trouble you
with the particulars of my adventures.

140
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:19,698
I wouldn't dream of detaining you.

141
00:24:19,868 --> 00:24:22,985
Having been condemned by nature
to an active life,

142
00:24:23,148 --> 00:24:25,537
I must take my leave of you. Farewell.

143
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,858
Farewell.

144
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:30,940
Why does he talk
in such an extraordinary way?

145
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:34,578
He can only speak the words
that Dean Swift gave him to say.

146
00:24:34,748 --> 00:24:37,820
That's ridiculous. There never was a Gulliver.

147
00:24:37,988 --> 00:24:40,980
- He's a fictional character.
- Of course he is.

148

she can turn us both to stone.
