1
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:45,757
Nothing can be done for this chap.

2
00:00:45,847 --> 00:00:47,599
That's strange.

3
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:49,962
There's centuries between these two weapons.

4
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:53,725
What's that on his jacket?

5
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:57,595
Radiation detector and a gas mask.
The two things don't go together, do they?

6
00:00:57,687 --> 00:01:00,804
It's like finding remains of a stone age man
with a transistor radio.

7
00:01:00,887 --> 00:01:02,400
Playing rock music.

8
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:04,125
A 1 ,000 year war?

9
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:07,165
-Civilisation on the point of collapse.
-What?

10
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:09,715
Nothing. Just theorising, that's all.

11
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:13,399
-Come along.
-Where are we going?

12
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:14,926
Er...

13
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:17,046
forward.

14
00:01:40,587 --> 00:01:43,021
Even the dead have a part to play.

15
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:45,826
Propped up to make
the trenches appear fully manned.

16
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:49,980
-Different sort of uniform from that other chap's.
-Yes. We may have crossed the lines.

17
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:53,616
-Same mixture of ancient and modern, though.
-Yes.

18
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:56,505
That's why I think this war
has being going on for a very long time.

19
00:01:56,587 --> 00:02:00,546
They probably started out with the most modern
equipment but no longer have the resources.

20
00:02:00,627 --> 00:02:03,744
-Have to make do.
-War of attrition, eh? Only backwards.

21
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:06,295
At this rate, they're going to finish up with
bows and arrows.

22
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:08,264
Well, it would explain the mixture of equipment.

23
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:09,706
Psst.

24
00:02:09,787 --> 00:02:12,506
-Be careful, Sarah.
-It's all right.

25
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:15,226
-It's locked.
-It's pretty solid, isn't it?

26
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:17,263
Some kind of service tunnel, I suppose.

27
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,059
It might even lead into the dome.

28
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:20,899
Let's see where the trench leads.

29
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,263
(PROJECTILE WHISTLING)

30
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:35,302
-It's a gas shell.
-Gas!

31
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:37,622
-Poison gas.
-Respirators, quick.

32
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:45,859
Get back!

33
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,224
This one's alive. Get him inside.

34
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:12,504
There's another one here.

35
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:15,585
Get him inside. Quickly.
<i>(part1 ends)</i>

36
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:29,277
Sit down.

37
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:30,843
Thank you.

38
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,114
You're not with the military, I assume?

39
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:39,480
-I'm with the science division.
-Oh, good, good.

40
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:42,761
Then perhaps we can talk without interruption
from rifle butts.

41
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:44,482
That depends.

42
00:03:44,564 --> 00:03:47,636
If you don't answer my questions,
I shall hand you back to the military.

43
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:50,079
They take a pride in loosening tongues.

44
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:53,514
Now, where did you get these things?

45
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:55,196
Oh, here and there.

46
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:58,515
If I didn't know better, I should have to assume

47
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:01,482
that these were made
by some intelligence on another planet.

48
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:03,839
If you didn't know better.

49
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:07,200
It is an established scientific fact
that in the seven galaxies

50
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:10,196
only Skaro is capable of supporting intelligent life.

51
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:14,994
It is also an established scientific fact
that there are more than seven galaxies.

52
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:17,032
-Indeed.
-Yes.

53
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,160
When you passed through our security scan

54
00:04:19,244 --> 00:04:22,839
our instruments ran a complete check
on your blood and chemical make-up,

55
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:25,313
encephalographic patterns and so on.

56
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:29,716
Physiological compositions,
and so if you are from another planet...

57
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:35,763
-You were saying...
-There's nothing.

58
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:39,917
Nothing conforms to any known life on this planet.

59
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:43,395
Apart from external appearances.

60
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:46,476
You can't always judge from external appearances.

61
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:50,036
Who are you?

62
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,354
-Where are you from?
-It's a long story.

63
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:56,715
Then tell me.

64
00:04:57,524 --> 00:05:01,995
Do you have any inkling of the theory
of space dimension correlated to relative time?

65
00:05:02,284 --> 00:05:04,240
(ALARM RINGING)

66
00:05:05,924 --> 00:05:09,234
(OVER INTERCOM) <i>Davros wishes</i>
<i>all members of the Elite scientific corps</i>

67
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:11,792
<i>to assemble in the main laboratory immediately.</i>

68
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:13,602
Our session will have to wait.

69
00:05:13,684 --> 00:05:15,800
-Davros is coming.
-Your chief scientist?

70
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:17,602
He's our supreme commander.

71
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,276
When he calls a full meeting like this,

72
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:22,003
he obviously has something
of the greatest importance to tell us.

73
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:25,963
-Well, I shall be delighted to meet him.
-Stand up and keep quiet.

74
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:36,915
<i>If I may have your attention.</i>

75
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,803
<i>For some time</i>

76
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:42,876
<i>I have been experimenting</i>
<i>with the Mark III project.</i>

77
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,914
<i>Details of modifications</i>
<i>will be distributed later, however...</i>

78
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:50,474
<i>I am anxious that you should see immediately</i>

79
00:05:50,604 --> 00:05:53,072
<i>the remarkable results that I have achieved.</i>

80
00:05:54,204 --> 00:05:56,001
<i>And to that end</i>

81
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:58,803
<i>I have arranged this demonstration.</i>

82
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:15,001
-A Dalek.
-What?

83
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:18,315
A Dalek, very primitive but undeniably a Dalek.

84
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:21,521
You're mistaken. It's a Mark III travel machine.

85
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:24,116
-If you say so.
-DAVROS: <i>Halt.</i>

86
00:06:25,324 --> 00:06:27,440
<i>Turn left, move forward.</i>

87
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:31,440
That's magnificent. He's perfected voice control.

88
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:33,477
<i>Turn right.</i>

89
00:06:35,164 --> 00:06:37,553
<i>Move forward and circle left.</i>

90
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:42,276
<i>You will agree, I think,</i>
<i>that voice control represents</i>

91
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:45,515
<i>an enormous step forward, however,</i>

92
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:48,994
<i>the best is yet to come. Nyder.</i>

93
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:14,193
<i>Our machine is now equipped</i>
<i>with a weapon for self-defence.</i>

94
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:20,075
<i>Now, I am going to turn the machine over</i>
<i>to total self-control.</i>

95
00:07:20,164 --> 00:07:22,439
<i>It will be entirely independent</i>

96
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:24,913
<i>of all outside influences.</i>

97
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:30,920
<i>A living, thinking, self-supporting creature.</i>

98
00:07:41,884 --> 00:07:43,761
DAVROS: <i>Brilliant.</i>

99
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:47,393
<i>Brilliant! It has detected the non-conformity.</i>

100
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:50,681
DALEK: <i>Aliens. I must exterminate.</i>

101
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:52,914
<i>-Exterminate.</i>
-No.

102
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:58,474
<i>You dare to interfere!</i>

103
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:02,239
<i>You have the audacity to interrupt</i>
<i>one of my experiments.</i>

104
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:05,873
<i>-But it would have destroyed him.</i>
<i>-So you think the saving of a worthless life</i>

105
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:08,432
<i>more important than the progress we have made?</i>

106
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:11,402
<i>My creature showed a natural desire,</i>

107
00:08:11,484 --> 00:08:15,397
<i>an instinct to destroy and you interceded.</i>

108
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:18,157
<i>You will be punished for this!</i>

109
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:20,394
Davros, I'm sorry.

110
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:23,874
But I believe these prisoners,
they could be extremely valuable.

111
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:28,323
By all means, when I finish my questions,
let the machine do what it likes with them but...

112
00:08:28,404 --> 00:08:30,634
I do need to interrogate them further.

113
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,003
<i>You will be punished for insubordination.</i>

114
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:38,441
<i>In the meantime, you may question the prisoners</i>
<i>until first light.</i>

115
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:42,517
<i>After that, they will be used to resume</i>
<i>the experiment.</i>

116
00:08:42,884 --> 00:08:44,795
<i>This meeting is ended.</i>

117
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:57,001
-Thank you, I am obliged to you.
-I was merely doing my duty.

118
00:08:57,084 --> 00:09:00,872
I believe that you have knowledge
which could be of the greatest assistance to us.

119
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:04,476
But if you don't cooperate,

120
00:09:04,564 --> 00:09:07,795
then it is certain that Davros will use you
as an experiment

121
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:09,602
with his machine in a few hours' time.

122
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:13,438
The prisoners are to be taken to the cells,
you can continue questioning them there.

123
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:15,196
Davros orders it.

124
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:37,243
-You all right?
-Looks like I might be.

125
00:09:37,324 --> 00:09:38,803
What happened?

126
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:42,039
They took down reams of notes.

127
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,922
Every bit of scientific gobbledegook
I could think of.

128
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:47,199
Technical jargon that even I didn't understand.

129
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:49,798
-That'll keep their experts tied up for weeks.
-Yes.

130
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:52,603
And I learnt a great deal more from them
than they did from me.

131
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:54,117
-About this bunker?
-Yes.

132
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:57,037
-It is underground, isn't it?
-Yes, bomb-proof.

133
00:09:57,124 --> 00:10:01,276
Impregnable from attack from the outside and
about three or four miles from the Kaled dome.

134
00:10:01,364 --> 00:10:03,082
What are they doing down here?

135
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:06,361
Years ago, the Kaled government
decided to form an elite group.

136
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:08,196
The best scientific brains in every field.

137
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:09,876
-A sort of think tank.
-Yes.

138
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:12,478
But over the years the Elite has become
more and more powerful

139
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:15,032
and now they can demand whatever they like.

140
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:16,876
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

141
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:19,797
-Open up.
-Perhaps this is the tea.

142
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:25,114
There's no need to wait, I am armed.

143
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:34,673
I'm sorry if they hurt you.

144
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:37,401
I lack the courage to interfere.

145
00:10:37,484 --> 00:10:41,079
But you did save me from becoming
the very first victim of a Dalek. Thank you.

146
00:10:41,164 --> 00:10:45,316
Yes, now you used that word earlier.
It had never been heard before.

147
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:48,996
And yet only an hour ago,
Davros announced that henceforth

148
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:52,918
his Mark III travel machine would be
referred to as a Dalek.

149
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:56,314
Now how could you have known that?

150
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:58,679
Well, I have an advantage in terms of time.

151
00:10:58,764 --> 00:11:01,358
You see, we've come here at this time
because of future concern

152
00:11:01,444 --> 00:11:03,241
about the development of the Dalek.

153
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:06,122
I think you're concerned, too, aren't you?

154
00:11:07,724 --> 00:11:10,079
(WHISPERING) I think he's going to bite.

155
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:15,837
Yes, I am concerned and there are a few others
who think the same as I.

156
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:18,802
-But we're powerless.
-Then let us help you.

157
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:21,275
You see, we believe that

158
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:24,993
Davros has changed the direction of our research
into something which is...

159
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,040
immoral, evil.

160
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:31,324
You see, the Elite was formed

161
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:33,918
to produce weapons that would end this war.

162
00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:37,792
We soon saw that this was futile
and changed the direction of our research into...

163
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:40,114
into the survival of our race.

164
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:44,523
But our chemical weapons had already
started to produce genetic mutations.

165
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,640
And the mutations were banished
out into the wastelands.

166
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:48,635
-Yes.
-The mutos.

167
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:53,563
Now Davros, he believed that there was
no way to reverse this trend

168
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:56,158
and so he started experiments

169
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:58,917
to establish our final mutational form.

170
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:02,315
He took living cells,

171
00:12:02,404 --> 00:12:04,964
treated them with chemicals and produced

172
00:12:05,044 --> 00:12:06,875
the ultimate creature.

173
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:10,916
Come with me.

174
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:29,596
Now this is what the Kaleds will become.

175
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,642
(GROWLING)

176
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:50,562
That is our future.

177
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:56,476
Go on, Ronson.

178
00:12:56,564 --> 00:13:00,842
Well, knowing our ultimate form,
Davros had to devise a travel machine.

179
00:13:00,924 --> 00:13:03,358
-The Dalek.
-Now he's trying to change that into a weapon.

180
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:05,241
And he's succeeding.

181
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:08,122
He's created a monster,
utterly devoid of conscience.

182
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,196
-And you want to stop him?
-Well, I must.

183
00:13:11,284 --> 00:13:15,357
There are a few in the Kaled government
who still have the power to act.

184
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:18,880
If they knew the truth,
they would end Davros' power,

185
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,273
close down this bunker, finish the only...

186
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:23,082
Then go to them, Ronson, go to them.

187
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:27,203
But I'm not allowed in the city.
Security here is absolute.

188
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:30,640
Then help us to escape. Give us the names
of the men who have the power.

189
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:32,919
Could you get us out of here?

190
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:34,801
There is a way.

191
00:13:34,884 --> 00:13:37,159
Through one of the secondary ducts
in the ventilation system

192
00:13:37,244 --> 00:13:39,235
that leads to a cave at the edge of the wasteland.

193
00:13:39,324 --> 00:13:42,873
-Well?
-The entrance is barred.

194
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:45,398
And there's something else.

195
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:48,442
Davros' early experiments were with animals.

196
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:52,001
Some of the things that he created were horrific.

197
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:55,760
And they're still alive.

198
00:13:56,284 --> 00:14:00,277
And I have an uneasy feeling
you're going to tell me they're in that cave.

199
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:05,436
These are the people you should try to contact.

200
00:14:05,524 --> 00:14:06,752
Righto.

201
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:08,675
Look, if anything at all should happen...

202
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:12,200
-Don't worry, we won't let it fall into wrong hands.
-Quick.
<i>(part2 ends)</i>

203
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:29,546
I've just had word
from one of our supporters in the dome.

204
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:32,267
Councillor Mogran has called a secret meeting.

205
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:36,819
The only councillors invited are known opponents
of the work we are doing here in the bunker.

206
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:39,581
<i>I want a full report</i>
<i>on everything that was discussed.</i>

207
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:42,466
<i>I don't care how you get the information, get it.</i>

208
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:46,224
<i>I think we need not be too concerned.</i>

209
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:50,779
<i>Many times in the last 50 years, factions</i>
<i>of the government have tried to interfere</i>

210
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:53,382
<i>with my research here, they have failed.</i>

211
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:55,106
<i>They will fail again.</i>

212
00:14:55,828 --> 00:15:00,618
There's something else. The two prisoners in
Ronson's charge, they've been seen at the dome.

213
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,381
-They are at the meeting.
<i>-Impossible!</i>

214
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:07,787
<i>-There is no escape from here.</i>
-I've checked their cells. They are missing.

215
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:16,861
<i>Find out how they escaped</i>
<i>and report to me immediately.</i>

216
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:21,100
-What action shall I take concerning Ronson?
<i>-For the moment, none.</i>

217
00:15:21,668 --> 00:15:24,387
<i>I will deal with him in my own way.</i>

218
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:33,184
-That was a very impressive speech, Doctor.
-Yes, it was meant to be.

219
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:34,667
Let's hope it's convinced them.

220
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:37,899
Yes, let's hope so, Harry.
Sometimes words aren't enough.

221
00:15:37,988 --> 00:15:40,502
Well, they seem to have reached a decision.

222
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:48,385
I'm afraid, Doctor, the councillors could not agree
to halt all experimentation at the bunker.

223
00:15:48,468 --> 00:15:51,380
-The councillors are fools.
-Let me finish, please.

224
00:15:51,468 --> 00:15:53,823
It has been agreed that an independent tribunal

225
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:56,263
will investigate all work
that is being done at the bunker.

226
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:57,747
But that could take months.

227
00:15:57,828 --> 00:16:00,183
Davros already has several
prototype Daleks ready for action.

228
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:02,736
It has also been agreed that,
pending the investigation,

229
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,547
Davros' experiments will be suspended.

230
00:16:05,628 --> 00:16:07,346
It is less than I'd hoped for.

231
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:10,824
And I promise you, Doctor,
if your allegations are borne out,

232
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:14,418
-all work at the bunker will be closed down.
-Thank you.

233
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:19,342
And now I must go with my committee
and inform Davros of our decision.

234
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,017
I think it's high time
we looked for Sarah, don't you?

235
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:26,545
-The one you left behind in the wastelands?
-Yes, you have some news of her?

236
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:29,377
I can't be certain, you understand?

237
00:16:29,468 --> 00:16:33,461
But our agents inside the Thal dome
report a newly arrived girl prisoner

238
00:16:33,548 --> 00:16:36,699
who led an attempted break-out.
Gave the Thals quite a bit of trouble.

239
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,938
-That'll be her.
-In the Thal dome, you say?

240
00:16:39,028 --> 00:16:43,146
The Thals are using prisoners
to load their last great rocket.

241
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:46,140
-Rocket?
-They think they'll win the war with it.

242
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:49,061
What they don't know is that
no matter how powerful their rocket,

243
00:16:49,148 --> 00:16:51,264
it cannot penetrate our protective dome.

244
00:16:51,348 --> 00:16:54,385
Only a matter of months ago,
Davros perfected a new substance

245
00:16:54,468 --> 00:16:56,902
which has the strength
of 30-foot thick reinforced concrete.

246
00:16:56,988 --> 00:17:00,537
Yes, well, never mind about that.
Could you help us to find Sarah?

247
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:05,702
One of my agents could lead you
into the service shaft underneath the Thal city.

248
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:09,258
-But after that, you're strictly on your own.
-Fair enough.

249
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:12,966
Right, I'll give you a map
showing how to reach the rocket silo area.

250
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:13,756
Thank you.

251
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:17,857
<i>An investigation? But of course, Mogran.</i>

252
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:23,544
<i>I welcome any inquiry into our work here.</i>
<i>I think the idea is an excellent one.</i>

253
00:17:24,728 --> 00:17:29,677
There's one thing more.
Until the inquiry, all work is to be suspended.

254
00:17:29,888 --> 00:17:33,278
<i>If that is your wish, then naturally I will obey.</i>

255
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,398
<i>It will take some time</i>
<i>to close down certain pieces of equipment.</i>

256
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:40,241
<i>Shall we say 24 hours?</i>

257
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:45,524
-Twelve.
<i>-It will be difficult but it will be done.</i>

258
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:48,880
The members of the tribunal
will arrive in that time.

259
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:00,499
We cannot allow this investigation!

260
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:03,500
They cannot fail to see the dangers
to themselves in the Dalek project.

261
00:18:03,588 --> 00:18:05,738
<i>Calm yourself, Nyder.</i>

262
00:18:05,828 --> 00:18:09,184
<i>-There will be no investigation.</i>
-But you can't stop it now.

263
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:11,020
<i>I can and will!</i>

264
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:15,067
<i>The Council has signed the death warrant</i>
<i>of the whole of the Kaled people.</i>

265
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:19,585
<i>Only we, the Elite, we and the Daleks will go on.</i>

266
00:18:20,828 --> 00:18:24,503
The whole of the Kaled people?
You would go that far?

267
00:18:24,828 --> 00:18:26,500
<i>Did you ever doubt it?</i>

268
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:28,617
No.

269
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:31,340
<i>There is much to do.</i>

270
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:36,385
<i>I want the genetically conditioned creatures</i>
<i>installed in the machines immediately.</i>

271
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:37,981
<i>-20 of them.</i>
-20?

272
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:42,744
<i>-They are our troops in this battle for survival.</i>
-But they are still very erratic, unstable.

273
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:45,501
<i>They will not be allowed self-control.</i>

274
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:49,697
<i>I will prepare a computer program</i>
<i>that will limit their actions.</i>

275
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:54,227
<i>After that, we are going on a journey.</i>

276
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:09,000
-You think they believed you?
<i>-It is unimportant.</i>

277
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:11,158
<i>They are hungry for victory.</i>

278
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:15,719
<i>They will use the formula and fire their rocket</i>
<i>no matter what they believe my motives to be.</i>

279
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:19,562
<i>And when they do, Nyder, when they do...</i>

280
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:28,799
I've given orders that a barrage
of shells containing the formula

281
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:30,640
should begin as soon as possible.

282
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:33,083
The rocket launch can begin immediately.

283
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:36,725
And now I'll arrange
your safe escort out of the city.

284
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:47,481
Doctor, somehow we've got to warn Mogran
and the other Kaled leaders.

285
00:19:47,568 --> 00:19:51,117
Yes, and we haven't found Sarah yet. Come on.

286
00:19:58,128 --> 00:20:01,165
Excuse me, can you help me? I'm a spy.

287
00:20:04,688 --> 00:20:06,406
Their suits, Harry.

288
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:29,081
-Harry! Doc...
-You all right, Sarah?

289
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,166
Oh! I am now. Listen, we've got to get out of here.

290
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:35,320
-The Thals are going to launch this rocket...
-I know. Listen.

291
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:38,047
I want you and Harry to go back
to the Kaled dome. Harry knows the way.

292
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:41,245
Tell them all we know. There's a chance
if they launch an all-out offensive,

293
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:43,683
-I might be able to stop the rocket.
-What are you going to do?

294
00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:46,441
-Try to sabotage it, or at least delay it. Off you go.
-Right.

295
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:49,326
-Good luck.
-Sevrin, you come with us.
<i>(part3 ends)</i>

296
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:48,962
I sent Harry and Sarah in there.

297
00:22:00,447 --> 00:22:02,085
<i>Switch it off.</i>

298
00:22:04,687 --> 00:22:09,602
<i>We will avenge the annihilation of our people</i>
<i>with a retaliation so massive,</i>

299
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:14,636
<i>so merciless that it will live in history.</i>

300
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:36,196
<i>Let the vengeance begin</i>
<i>with the death of the arch traitor,</i>

301
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:39,597
<i>the Thal spy Ronson!</i>

302
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:41,757
No! Davros!

303
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:43,519
<i>Exterminate!</i>

304
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:45,564
<i>Exterminate!</i>

305
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:47,922
<i>-Exterminate!</i>
-No!

306
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,641
No!

307
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:03,397
<i>Today the Kaled race is ended,</i>
<i>consumed in a fire of war,</i>

308
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:06,877
<i>but from its ashes will rise a new race,</i>

309
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:10,926
<i>the supreme creature,</i>
<i>the ultimate conqueror of the universe,</i>

310
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:12,878
<i>the Dalek!</i>

311
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:18,277
-Did you have friends in the Kaled city?
-Yes.

312
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:20,838
Two people very dear to me.

313
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,678
I sent them into that holocaust.

314
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:25,439
What will you do now?

315
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,085
Start again.

316
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:31,000
Try and find a way
to complete what I set out to do

317
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:32,964
and stop the development of the Daleks.

318
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:34,560
-Daleks?
-Yes.

319
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:37,480
Machine creatures
that Davros is developing, monsters.

320
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:39,842
Davros? No, you're wrong.

321
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:42,765
It was he who told us
how to destroy the Kaled dome.

322
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:46,123
-His only interest is in achieving peace.
-Let me tell you something.

323
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:49,722
The Kaled government was on the point
of stopping Davros' experiments.

324
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:53,402
And rather than let that happen,
he helped you to destroy his own race.

325
00:23:53,487 --> 00:23:56,763
You'll never convince my people of that.
Davros is a hero.

326
00:23:56,847 --> 00:23:59,486
Yes, for how long I wonder.

327
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:01,046
I must go.

328
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:04,119
Under the general amnesty,
you're free to leave whenever you want.

329
00:24:04,207 --> 00:24:05,526
Thank you.

330
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:13,879
<i>-Well?</i>
-The Daleks are in position.

331
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:16,037
They will act on your command.

332
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:19,563

334
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:27,158
<i>Exterminate!</i>

335
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,398
<i>Exterminate!</i>

336
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:37,444
<i>Exterminate!</i>

337
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:40,599
(YELLING)

338
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:47,764
-What are they?
-Keep back.

339
00:24:47,847 --> 00:24:49,485
Get out of sight.

340
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:16,164
We've got to get out of the Thal dome.

341
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:19,876
-Are those the Daleks?
-Out into the wastelands. Do you know a way?

342
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:27,765
Good. Yes, they are the Daleks.
Come on, lead the way.

343
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,522
DALEKS: (IN THE DISTANCE) <i>Exterminate!</i>

344
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:45,478
<i>Exterminate!</i>

345
00:25:47,127 --> 00:25:49,197
Oh, there was no need to go that far.

346
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:51,847
When our leaders saw they were beaten,
they should've surrendered.

347
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,360
Perhaps they did.

348
00:25:53,447 --> 00:25:55,438
But Daleks accept no terms,

349
00:25:55,527 --> 00:25:58,200
they're programmed to wipe the Thals
from the face of this planet.

350
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:01,085
But there must be some who'll escape.
Some survivors.

351
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:02,441
A few perhaps.

352
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:06,122
But they need to be grouped together into
some kind of fighting force to strike the bunker.

353
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:09,961
-What?
-Destroy Davros and you destroy the Daleks.

354
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:13,562
-What chance do we have against them?
-It's your only chance.

355
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:15,486
Will you do it?

356
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:16,602
Yes.

357
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:19,440
Good girl. I'm going to try
and get back into the bunker.

358
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:21,597
-Alone?
-Good luck.

359
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:25,680
<i>Exterminate!</i>

360
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:47,555

HARRY: Yes.

361
00:26:48,087 --> 00:26:49,600
Doctor?

362
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:52,880
-Harry!
-Hello.

363
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:56,323
-Sarah! I can hardly believe it.
-What's the matter with you?

364
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:58,915
I thought you were in the Kaled dome
when it was hit.

365
00:26:59,007 --> 00:27:00,998
-We didn't get there.
-No.

366
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:03,317
Halfway across the wastelands
we were attacked by a band of mutos.

367
00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:05,318
And that's when the rocket was launched.

368
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:09,639
-And then when the Kaled dome exploded...
-The mutos just ran for their lives.

369
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:12,764
Of course, I knew you'd try and get back
into the bunker through the cave.

370
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:15,805
You were absolutely right, Harry.
It's vital we go back into the bunker.

371
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:18,447
-Why?
-Because they took the time ring.

372
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:21,280
The bracelet that the Time Lord gave me
is our lifeline.

373
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:24,120
Without it we can never escape from this planet.

374
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:40,838
Sevrin, would you do something for us,
something important?

375
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:45,641
Over in the Kaled trenches,
there's a Thal, a girl named Bettan.

376
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:48,162
She's trying to form a resistance group.

377
00:27:48,247 --> 00:27:50,807
Join her with as many of your own people
as you can get.

378
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:53,162
Their idea is to knock out the bunker.

379
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:54,919
Do you think they'll get away with it?

380
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:59,398
It'll keep the Elite's troops occupied
while I try to find a weakness of the Daleks.

381
00:27:59,487 --> 00:28:00,806
Good luck, Doctor.

382
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,720
Sevrin, thank you.

383
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:15,442
(GROWLING)

384
00:28:17,287 --> 00:28:18,845
Who's that?

385
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,517
Just one of Davros' experiments.

386
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:24,603
We better stick close together.

387
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:32,964
HARRY: You're not scared, are you?
SARAH: Of course not.

388
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:34,196
I am.

389
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:50,244
Listen, I've been down tunnels before
and I've just had a rather nasty thought.

390
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:52,085
-Really?
-Yes.

391
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:55,007
Suppose something's waiting for us in there.

392
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:57,440
That is nasty.

393
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,836
Better not tell Harry, he's gone first.

394
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:25,643
<i>Welcome back.</i>

395
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:31,076
You were right, Sarah,
about there being something nasty waiting for us.

396
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:34,682
<i>I have read the initial reports</i>
<i>of your interrogation.</i>

397
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:38,841
<i>The suggestion that you have travelled</i>
<i>through space and time</i>

398
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:42,602
<i>was utterly dismissed by the computer analysis.</i>

399
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:47,079
I imagine it had never been programmed
for such a concept.

400
00:29:47,207 --> 00:29:48,526
<i>Precisely.</i>

401
00:29:48,607 --> 00:29:52,282
<i>I, however, I am perhaps more flexible.</i>

402
00:29:52,607 --> 00:29:55,679
<i>Though the power of such travel</i>
<i>is beyond my scientific comprehension,</i>

403
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:58,600
<i>it is not beyond my imagination.</i>

404
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:00,919
<i>Why did you come here?</i>

405
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,885
-To stop the development of the Daleks.
<i>-Why?</i>

406
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:07,400
Because having lived
in what you would call the future,

407
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:10,559
I have seen the carnage
and destruction they have caused.

408
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:13,559
<i>Then my Daleks do go on. They do survive.</i>

409
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:17,276
Yes. As weapons of hate and machines of war.

410
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:20,757
<i>-Fascinating.</i>
-But there's still time to change all that.

411
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:23,726
Why not make them a force for good
throughout the universe?

412
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:25,957
<i>-I could do it.</i>
-Then do it.

413
00:30:26,327 --> 00:30:28,158
Be remembered for that.

414
00:30:34,247 --> 00:30:36,807
<i>You have seen my Daleks in battle?</i>

415
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:39,602
Many times. I've fought against them.

416
00:30:39,687 --> 00:30:42,042
<i>And do they win? Do they always win?</i>

417
00:30:42,127 --> 00:30:44,687
Not always. They have been defeated.

418
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:46,564
But never utterly defeated.

419
00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:48,285
The Dalek menace always remains.

420
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:50,517
<i>If, as you say, they become</i>
<i>the supreme creatures of war,</i>

421
00:30:50,607 --> 00:30:53,041
<i>how can they lose? How can they fail?</i>

422
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:57,882
Misfortune, lack of information,
sometimes overwhelming opposition.

423
00:30:57,967 --> 00:31:00,959
<i>Yes, but tell me, how do the Daleks fail?</i>

424
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:02,958
No, Davros,

425
00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:06,164
that is a question
that the future must keep secret.

426
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:08,317
<i>What mistakes do they make?</i>

427
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:10,645
<i>-You will tell me!</i>
-No.

428
00:31:10,727 --> 00:31:13,924
<i>-You will tell me!</i>
-No, I will not!

429
00:31:19,847 --> 00:31:20,996
<i>Nyder.</i>

430
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:29,365
<i>You will tell me because you have a weakness</i>

431
00:31:29,447 --> 00:31:32,519
<i>that I have totally eliminated</i>
<i>from the minds of the Daleks</i>

432
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:34,962
<i>so they will always be superior.</i>

433
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:39,404
<i>A weakness that will make you</i>
<i>give me the knowledge to change the future.</i>

434
00:31:40,007 --> 00:31:43,079
<i>You are afflicted with a conscience.</i>

00:31:57,647 --> 00:32:00,115
<i>Let me tell you what is going to happen.</i>

437
00:32:00,207 --> 00:32:04,359
<i>You will answer my questions.</i>
<i>You will answer them carefully and precisely.</i>

438
00:32:04,447 --> 00:32:07,644
<i>The instruments to which you are wired</i>
<i>are particularly sensitive.</i>

439
00:32:07,727 --> 00:32:10,958
<i>They will detect instantly any attempt to lie.</i>

440
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:15,165
-And if I do lie?
<i>-If you lie, your friends will suffer.</i>

441
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,198

Don't tell him, Doctor.

445
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:36,477
<i>Now, you will tell me the reason</i>
<i>for every Dalek defeat.</i>

446
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:38,762
<i>With that knowledge, I will program them.</i>

447
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:42,123
<i>With that knowledge, they will know their errors</i>
<i>and how to avoid them.</i>

448
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:45,005
<i>With that knowledge, there will be no defeats!</i>

449
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:46,884
<i>We will begin!</i>

00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:53,401
if I tell you what you want to know,
I betray millions of people in the future.

-I can't do that.
<i>-But you can!</i>

<i>You will tell me!</i>
<i>(part4 ends)</i>

All right, all right!

Just leave them alone.

458
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:15,764
Dalek invasion of the Earth in the year 2000

459
00:33:15,852 --> 00:33:19,401
was foiled because of an attempt by the Daleks
to mine the core of the planet.

460
00:33:19,492 --> 00:33:21,562
<i>-The magnetic properties of the Earth...</i>
-Mars...

461
00:33:21,652 --> 00:33:25,645
the Daleks were defeated
by a virus that attacked the insulation

462
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:28,485
on the cables in their electrical systems.

463
00:33:29,692 --> 00:33:32,889
...in the space year 1 7,000,

464
00:33:32,972 --> 00:33:36,089
was halted by the intervention
of a fleet of war rockets

465
00:33:36,172 --> 00:33:38,242
from the planet Hyperon.

466
00:33:39,652 --> 00:33:42,166
The rockets were made of a metal

467
00:33:42,252 --> 00:33:45,449
that was completely resistant to Dalek firepower.

468
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:49,045
The Dalek Task Force was completely destroyed.

<i>Take them away.</i>

475
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:26,371
<i>Doctor, stay a moment.</i>

476
00:34:27,212 --> 00:34:28,804
<i>Sit down.</i>

477
00:34:29,372 --> 00:34:32,921
<i>Let us talk together now,</i>
<i>not as prisoner and captor,</i>

<i>but as men of science.</i>

479
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:37,601
<i>There is so much I wish to know.</i>

480
00:34:38,172 --> 00:34:40,970
<i>-Nyder, take charge of the tape.</i>
-Immediately, Davros.

481
00:34:41,052 --> 00:34:44,886
<i>It will be your responsibility</i>
<i>and remember, it is priceless.</i>

482
00:34:44,972 --> 00:34:47,088
<i>Its value beyond computation.</i>

483
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:04,924
-Thank you.
-Who are you?

484
00:35:05,012 --> 00:35:06,764
-My name's Gharman.
-Gharman?

485
00:35:06,852 --> 00:35:10,447
Until a few hours ago,
I was head of the Military Elite Scientific Corps.

486
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:13,968
And now you're a prisoner like us?
What happened?

487
00:35:15,252 --> 00:35:16,367
Wait.

488
00:35:18,972 --> 00:35:21,440
I was trying to organise
a movement against Davros.

489
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:23,409
He found out.

490
00:35:23,492 --> 00:35:25,244
Now, what's happening out there?

491
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:28,529
Has there been any attempt
to take away control from Davros?

492
00:35:28,612 --> 00:35:30,125
Not that we know of.

493
00:35:41,012 --> 00:35:43,810
Halt! State your business.

494
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:45,884
I wish to question the prisoners.

495
00:35:45,972 --> 00:35:47,849
Nobody is allowed
to communicate with the prisoners

496
00:35:47,932 --> 00:35:50,685
unless they have a pass signed by Davros.

497
00:35:52,252 --> 00:35:53,890
Stay where you are!

498
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,570
I...seem to have mislaid it.

499
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,530
I'll come back later.

500
00:36:08,212 --> 00:36:10,885
<i>Now future errors will be eradicated.</i>

501
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:12,883
<i>Defeats will become victories.</i>

502
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:15,770
<i>You have changed</i>
<i>the future of the universe, Doctor.</i>

503
00:36:15,852 --> 00:36:18,047
I have betrayed the future.

504
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:20,965
Davros, for the last time,
consider what you're doing.

505
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:22,770
Stop the development of the Daleks.

506
00:36:22,852 --> 00:36:25,969
<i>Impossible. It is beyond my control.</i>

507
00:36:26,052 --> 00:36:30,330
<i>The workshops are already fully automated</i>
<i>to produce the Dalek machines.</i>

508
00:36:30,412 --> 00:36:34,121
It's not the machines.
It's the minds of the creatures inside them.

509
00:36:34,212 --> 00:36:37,249
Minds that you created. They are totally evil.

510
00:36:37,332 --> 00:36:38,970
<i>Evil? No.</i>

511
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:41,602
<i>No, I will not accept that.</i>

512
00:36:42,052 --> 00:36:44,725
<i>They are conditioned simply to survive.</i>

513
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:48,442
<i>They can survive only by becoming</i>
<i>the dominant species.</i>

514
00:36:48,572 --> 00:36:50,722
<i>When all other life forms are suppressed,</i>

515
00:36:50,812 --> 00:36:54,043
<i>when the Daleks are the supreme rulers</i>
<i>of the universe,</i>

516
00:36:54,132 --> 00:36:57,090
<i>then you will have peace.</i>

517
00:36:57,812 --> 00:36:59,484
<i>Wars will end.</i>

518
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:03,883
<i>They are the power not of evil, but of good!</i>

519
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:09,205
Davros, if you had created
a virus in your laboratory,

520
00:37:09,332 --> 00:37:12,881
something contagious and infectious
that killed on contact,

521
00:37:12,972 --> 00:37:16,044
a virus that would destroy all other forms of life,

522
00:37:16,132 --> 00:37:17,850
would you allow its use?

523
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:20,446
<i>-It is an interesting conjecture.</i>
-Would you do it?

524
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,727
<i>The only living thing,</i>

525
00:37:23,372 --> 00:37:25,806
<i>a microscopic organism,</i>

526
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:27,962
<i>reigning supreme.</i>

527
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:31,850
<i>-A fascinating idea.</i>
-But would you do it?

528
00:37:33,012 --> 00:37:34,411
<i>Yes.</i>

529
00:37:35,652 --> 00:37:37,051
<i>Yes.</i>

530
00:37:38,252 --> 00:37:40,607
<i>To hold in my hand</i>

531
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,684
<i>a capsule that contains such power,</i>

532
00:37:44,572 --> 00:37:49,282
<i>to know that life and death</i>
<i>on such a scale was my choice.</i>

533
00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:53,208
<i>To know that the tiny pressure on my thumb,</i>

534
00:37:53,692 --> 00:37:57,651
<i>enough to break the glass, would end everything.</i>

535
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:00,291
<i>Yes.</i>

536
00:38:01,332 --> 00:38:03,004
<i>I would do it.</i>

537
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:07,048
<i>That power would set me up above the gods.</i>

538
00:38:07,132 --> 00:38:11,171
<i>And through the Daleks, I shall have that power!</i>

539
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:22,926
<i>-Release me.</i>
-No, Davros.

540
00:38:24,212 --> 00:38:26,680
<i>-Don't touch that switch.</i>
-Why not?

541
00:38:27,412 --> 00:38:30,085
<i>It controls my life support systems.</i>

542
00:38:30,452 --> 00:38:33,171
<i>I could not survive 30 seconds without them.</i>

543
00:38:33,252 --> 00:38:35,686
Order the destruction of the incubator section.

544
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,728
<i>Destroy the Daleks? Never.</i>

545
00:38:39,772 --> 00:38:41,410
(ALARM BEEPING)

546
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:47,930
I mean it, Davros.

547
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:52,164
Next time I press that switch, it stays pressed.
Now give the order!

548
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:56,601
<i>Even if I do this, there will be no escape for you.</i>

549
00:38:56,692 --> 00:38:59,570
I'll take that chance. Now give the order.

550
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:02,682
<i>Press the communicator switch.</i>

551
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:07,528
<i>This is Davros.</i>

552
00:39:07,772 --> 00:39:10,844
<i>Elite unit 7 will go to the incubator room.</i>

553
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:15,280
<i>All survival maintenance systems</i>
<i>are to be closed down.</i>

554
00:39:15,732 --> 00:39:19,645
<i>The Dalek creatures are to be destroyed.</i>

555
00:39:20,332 --> 00:39:23,290
Tell them the order cannot be countermanded.

556
00:39:24,012 --> 00:39:26,048
<i>This order cannot...</i>

557
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,444
<i>This is Davros. This is Davros.</i>

558
00:39:30,532 --> 00:39:33,729
<i>My last order is cancelled. Repeat, cancelled.</i>

559
00:39:33,812 --> 00:39:35,768
<i>No action is to be taken.</i>

560
00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:38,727
What do you want done with this?

561
00:39:38,892 --> 00:39:41,531
<i>For the moment, he must be kept alive.</i>

562
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,524
<i>He has knowledge that is vital to our future.</i>

563
00:39:44,612 --> 00:39:49,083
<i>And I will drain</i>
<i>every last detail of it from his mind.</i>

564
00:39:49,172 --> 00:39:51,003
<i>And then,</i>

565
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:54,209
<i>he will learn the true meaning of pain.</i>

566
00:39:54,612 --> 00:39:56,603
I will take him to the detention room.

567
00:39:57,412 --> 00:40:00,449
<i>The dissidents. What progress are they making?</i>

568
00:40:02,292 --> 00:40:04,522
Feeling against you is rising.

569
00:40:05,092 --> 00:40:08,243
Many of the scientific corps
are openly speaking against you.

570
00:40:08,332 --> 00:40:10,209
Even some of the military are joining them.

571
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:11,805
<i>As I expected.</i>

572
00:40:13,252 --> 00:40:16,210
<i>-They will take action soon?</i>
-Almost certainly.

573
00:40:16,732 --> 00:40:19,041
They outnumber those of us who are loyal.

574
00:40:19,132 --> 00:40:23,967
Davros, why don't you let me take
a squad of Elite men I can trust?

575
00:40:24,692 --> 00:40:27,525
In an hour, I could wipe out their leaders.

576
00:40:27,612 --> 00:40:29,842
<i>You think like a soldier, Nyder.</i>

577
00:40:29,932 --> 00:40:32,002
<i>Rebellion is an idea in the mind.</i>

578
00:40:32,092 --> 00:40:36,165
<i>Suppress it and it hides away and festers.</i>

579
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,968
<i>No. My way is best.</i>

580
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:41,051
As you wish.

581
00:40:42,012 --> 00:40:43,411
On your feet!

582
00:40:46,092 --> 00:40:47,320
Open up.

583
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:57,169
Not exactly as planned, Sarah.

584
00:40:57,732 --> 00:40:59,290
Doctor.

585
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:04,489
-He's a bit groggy but he'll be all right.
-Come on, Kavell, we've a lot to do.

586
00:41:04,572 --> 00:41:07,291
What about the guards?
Suppose they won't come over to our side?

587
00:41:07,372 --> 00:41:10,762
They'll be disarmed and held in custody
until we've presented our ultimatum to Davros.

588
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:14,322
No, wait, wait. Davros knows what you're planning.

589
00:41:14,412 --> 00:41:16,323
I heard him talking to Nyder.

590
00:41:16,412 --> 00:41:19,245
If he knows,
why hasn't he taken action against us?

591
00:41:19,332 --> 00:41:21,084
Perhaps because he knows it's futile.

592
00:41:21,172 --> 00:41:23,766
-There are too many of us.
-No, no, it's not that.

593
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:27,003
I don't know what he's got prepared for you
but believe me, he's ready.

594
00:41:27,092 --> 00:41:29,287
Even so, there'll still be too many for him.

595
00:41:29,372 --> 00:41:31,522
Just be careful. Be careful.

596
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:35,287
I think we can take care of things.
Thanks for the warning.

597
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:40,569
-No point in telling you to rest, I suppose.
-No, there isn't.

598
00:41:40,652 --> 00:41:42,244
We've got to recover that time ring.

599
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:46,086
Because without it, we'll never get off this planet.
But where is it?

600
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:48,367
It's on the desk in the main laboratory.

601
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:53,085
And there's that tape recording that Nyder took.
We've got to get it back at all costs.

602
00:41:53,172 --> 00:41:55,732
It would make the Daleks invincible. Come on.

603
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:06,369
Davros, they're taking over. We must act quickly.

604
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,804
In another hour, they could be totally in control.

605
00:42:09,892 --> 00:42:12,042
Do you hear me, Davros?

606
00:42:12,132 --> 00:42:15,124
I have a dozen crack men hiding in section 9.

607
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:17,762
Let me order them into action.

608
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:20,249
-Davros?
<i>-I hear you.</i>

609
00:42:20,652 --> 00:42:23,086
Then what are we going to do?

610
00:42:23,172 --> 00:42:27,324
<i>I want you to find their leaders</i>
<i>and hand over your weapons to them.</i>

611
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:28,606
Surrender?

612
00:42:28,692 --> 00:42:32,605
<i>Order all members of the Elite guards</i>
<i>still at liberty to do the same.</i>

613
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,162
Do you know what you're saying?

614
00:42:42,212 --> 00:42:44,646
<i>I know precisely what I am saying.</i>

615
00:42:45,092 --> 00:42:47,731
<i>Now, I will command and you will obey!</i>

616
00:42:48,972 --> 00:42:51,361
<i>You will do as I order!</i>

617
00:42:54,612 --> 00:42:59,606
<i>You will inform the rebel leaders</i>
<i>that I have given these orders to avoid bloodshed.</i>

618
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:04,769
<i>Tell them I submit</i>
<i>and will listen to their demands.</i>

619
00:43:04,852 --> 00:43:07,764
<i>-That is all.</i>
-Then we are admitting that we're beaten.

620
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:09,570
<i>That is what they will believe.</i>

621
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:13,000
You mean that...

622
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:18,007
<i>You and they will find out exactly what I mean</i>
<i>all in good time.</i>

623
00:43:18,732 --> 00:43:20,404
<i>Now carry out my orders.</i>

624
00:43:49,652 --> 00:43:51,370
(ELECTRONIC BUZZING)

625
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,570
(WHISPERING) Useful.

626
00:44:04,452 --> 00:44:05,487
Ah.

627
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:08,848
This is something rather more useful.

628
00:44:08,932 --> 00:44:10,923
-They're explosives, aren't they?
-Yes.

629
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:13,728
Explosives and detonators.

630
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,884
It seems almost providential.

631
00:44:15,972 --> 00:44:17,963
Why? What are you going to use them for?

632
00:44:18,052 --> 00:44:20,486
The Time Lord gave me three options.

633
00:44:20,572 --> 00:44:22,881
There's only one still open.

634
00:44:22,972 --> 00:44:24,883
-Genocide.
-Genocide?

635
00:44:24,972 --> 00:44:28,567
Yes. I'm going to kill everything
in the incubation room.

636
00:44:29,172 --> 00:44:31,925
I'm going to destroy the Daleks forever.

637
00:44:41,252 --> 00:44:43,208
Where is Davros?

638
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:46,443
-You said that Davros had agreed to meet us here.
-He'll be here.

639
00:44:59,092 --> 00:45:00,844
<i>You have something to say to me?</i>

640
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:04,004
Davros, we wish to make our views plain to you
concerning our work here.

641
00:45:04,092 --> 00:45:07,880
<i>With what authority do you speak?</i>
<i>With whose backing?</i>

642
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:11,851
We speak for virtually all the Elite scientific corps
and many of the military.

643
00:45:11,932 --> 00:45:13,809
We represent the majority.

644
00:45:13,892 --> 00:45:15,803
<i>Very well. Continue.</i>

645
00:45:17,332 --> 00:45:19,288
Nobody disputes that in the past,

646
00:45:19,372 --> 00:45:22,648
under your guidance, we've made
incredible progress in many fields of science.

647
00:45:22,732 --> 00:45:25,849
<i>You did not come here to flatter me.</i>
<i>You came to offer an ultimatum.</i>

648
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:28,446
<i>Confine yourself to the terms of that ultimatum.</i>

649
00:45:28,532 --> 00:45:29,965
Very well.

650
00:45:30,052 --> 00:45:31,724
The initial concept of the Dalek

651
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,372
was to build a life support system
and a travel machine

652
00:45:34,452 --> 00:45:37,444
for the creature that we know
our race will ultimately evolve into.

653
00:45:37,532 --> 00:45:39,090
<i>You disapprove of that?</i>

654
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:41,970
No, but we believe that concept
has been perverted.

655
00:45:42,052 --> 00:45:45,601
You have tampered
with the genetic structuring of the creature

656
00:45:45,692 --> 00:45:48,206
to create a ruthless power for evil.

657
00:45:48,692 --> 00:45:51,126
We cannot permit this to continue.

658
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:54,007
<i>Then what do you suggest?</i>

659
00:45:55,212 --> 00:45:58,488
All work on Dalek projects is to cease immediately.

660
00:45:58,572 --> 00:46:01,405
The creatures that have been conditioned
and programmed are to be destroyed.

661
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,687
If these terms are met, we will then be proud

662
00:46:03,772 --> 00:46:06,923
to work under your guidance
on the rebuilding of our society.

663
00:46:07,012 --> 00:46:09,048
<i>And if I refuse?</i>

664
00:46:09,132 --> 00:46:11,885
If you refuse, you will be placed under arrest.

665
00:46:11,972 --> 00:46:15,089
The Daleks will be destroyed
and our work here will then continue

666
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:18,289
under a new, democratically elected leader.

667
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:25,244
<i>Have you finished?</i>

668
00:46:27,692 --> 00:46:29,045
Well?

669
00:46:29,692 --> 00:46:33,844
<i>You might at least do me the courtesy</i>
<i>of giving me time to consider.</i>

670
00:46:47,412 --> 00:46:49,004
(SQUEAKING)

671
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,603
The Daleks are in there.

672
00:46:59,132 --> 00:47:00,884
The flesh and blood part of them.

673
00:47:00,972 --> 00:47:02,564
Indeed they are flesh and blood.

674
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:04,324
Some of them can move about.

675
00:47:04,412 --> 00:47:06,323
Well, how do I see?

676
00:47:06,412 --> 00:47:08,050
Press the button.

677
00:47:15,972 --> 00:47:17,644
-Here we go.
-Harry.

678
00:47:20,452 --> 00:47:22,647
You're not going in there, are you?

679
00:47:22,732 --> 00:47:25,451
They're harmless enough, I think. Just unpleasant.

680
00:47:25,532 --> 00:47:28,410
-You don't want me to come in, do you, Doctor?
-There's no need, Harry.

681
00:47:28,492 --> 00:47:31,689
It just remains to put the charges
where they'll do the most damage.

682
00:47:31,772 --> 00:47:34,809
It shouldn't take me more
than a couple of minutes.

683
00:47:42,932 --> 00:47:44,809
<i>I have made my decision.</i>

684
00:47:47,052 --> 00:47:49,008
<i>I accept your ultimatum.</i>

685
00:47:50,172 --> 00:47:52,686
<i>-On one condition.</i>
-Go on.

686
00:47:52,812 --> 00:47:56,851
<i>That you allow me to speak to a full meeting</i>
<i>of the Elite, both scientific and military.</i>

687
00:47:56,932 --> 00:47:58,684
<i>Anyone you elect may speak against me.</i>

688
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:01,127
<i>When this is done, a vote will be taken.</i>

689
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,362
<i>I will abide by the decision of the majority.</i>

690
00:48:03,452 --> 00:48:07,240
You already know the decision of the majority.
You will lose, Davros.

691
00:48:07,332 --> 00:48:10,130
<i>With such confidence,</i>
<i>you can hardly deny my request.</i>

692
00:48:10,212 --> 00:48:13,841
<i>It was you who introduced the word ''democracy''.</i>

693
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,809
Do we accept his proposition?

694
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,803
Very well, it's agreed.

695
00:48:17,892 --> 00:48:20,929
<i>The meeting will take place in one hour from now.</i>
<i>Arrange it.</i>

696
00:48:21,012 --> 00:48:22,684
<i>You may go.</i>

697
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:33,602
<i>Ours is the victory, Nyder. We have won.</i>
<i>(part5 ends)</i>

698
00:48:57,084 --> 00:48:58,642
What's taking him so long?

699
00:48:58,724 --> 00:49:03,195
It's a very difficult operation, Sarah.
Still, he should have finished by now.

700
00:49:03,284 --> 00:49:04,512
Doctor?

701
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:07,916
Doctor, are you all right?

702
00:49:11,404 --> 00:49:12,553
Sarah!

703
00:49:15,004 --> 00:49:16,642
Get it off!

704
00:49:18,044 --> 00:49:19,796
Get it off!

705
00:49:21,924 --> 00:49:23,323
Got it.

706
00:49:26,844 --> 00:49:28,038
Doctor!

707
00:49:32,244 --> 00:49:34,360
What are you waiting for?

708
00:49:34,444 --> 00:49:37,004
Just touch these two strands together

709
00:49:37,084 --> 00:49:39,200
and the Daleks are finished.

710
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:42,203
Have I that right?

711
00:49:42,284 --> 00:49:44,479
To destroy the Daleks? You can't doubt it.

712
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,680
Well, I do.

713
00:49:46,764 --> 00:49:49,676
You see, some things could be better
with the Daleks.

714
00:49:49,764 --> 00:49:53,757
Many future worlds will become allies
just because of their fear of the Daleks.

715
00:49:53,844 --> 00:49:55,323
But it isn't like that.

716
00:49:55,404 --> 00:49:58,874
But the final responsibility is mine,
and mine alone.

717
00:50:00,404 --> 00:50:03,760
Listen, if someone who knew the future

718
00:50:03,844 --> 00:50:06,438
pointed out a child to you
and told you that that child

719
00:50:06,524 --> 00:50:08,401
would grow up totally evil,

720
00:50:08,484 --> 00:50:11,840
to be a ruthless dictator
who would destroy millions of lives,

721
00:50:11,924 --> 00:50:14,199
could you then kill that child?

722
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:18,359
We're talking about the Daleks.
The most evil creatures ever invented.

723
00:50:18,444 --> 00:50:22,039
You must destroy them. You must complete
your mission for the Time Lords.

724
00:50:22,124 --> 00:50:23,876
Do I have the right?

725
00:50:24,964 --> 00:50:28,639
Simply touch one wire against the other
and that's it.

726
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:30,794
The Daleks cease to exist.

727
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:32,836
Hundreds of millions of people,

728
00:50:32,924 --> 00:50:36,883
thousands of generations
can live without fear, in peace,

729
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,673
and never even know the word ''Dalek''.

730
00:50:39,764 --> 00:50:41,322
Then why wait?

731
00:50:41,404 --> 00:50:45,636
If it was a disease or some sort of bacteria
you were destroying, you wouldn't hesitate.

732
00:50:45,724 --> 00:50:49,637
But if I kill, wipe out a whole intelligent life form,

733
00:50:49,724 --> 00:50:51,840
then I become like them.

734
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:53,642
I'd be no better than the Daleks.

735
00:50:53,724 --> 00:50:56,522
SARAH: Think of all the suffering
there'll be if you don't do it.

736
00:50:56,604 --> 00:50:58,515
GHARMAN: Doctor!

737
00:50:58,604 --> 00:51:00,834
Doctor, I've been looking everywhere for you.

738
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:02,721
Davros has agreed to our terms.

739
00:51:02,804 --> 00:51:05,716
-He submitted?
-He did. But he asked only one thing.

740
00:51:05,804 --> 00:51:09,956
That he might be allowed to address
a meeting of all the Elite, scientific and military.

741
00:51:10,044 --> 00:51:11,523
He's going to put a case?

742
00:51:11,604 --> 00:51:14,164
Yes, but a vote will be taken.
It's a foregone conclusion.

743
00:51:14,244 --> 00:51:18,715
There will be a complete landslide
against any further development of the Daleks.

744
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:20,476
We've won.

745
00:51:20,564 --> 00:51:22,759
I'm grateful to you, Gharman.

746
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:25,436
More grateful than I can tell you.

747
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:37,760
Everybody is here, Davros.

748
00:51:39,524 --> 00:51:42,482
<i>The issues are simple and clear cut.</i>

749
00:51:43,244 --> 00:51:46,793
<i>I have given my life's work</i>
<i>to the survival of our race.</i>

750
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,076
<i>The travel machine I designed,</i>

751
00:51:49,164 --> 00:51:53,442
<i>the Dalek, will give the creature</i>
<i>into which we will mutate</i>

752
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:56,322
<i>its only possibility of continued existence.</i>

753
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,235
But you have deviated from that intention.

754
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:01,396
You have introduced genetic changes
that will alter the mutation

755
00:52:01,484 --> 00:52:04,454
into a creature without morals and without ethics.

756
00:52:04,484 --> 00:52:08,716
<i>One race must survive all others.</i>
<i>And to do this, it must dominate.</i>

757
00:52:09,124 --> 00:52:10,716
<i>Ruthlessly.</i>

758
00:52:11,244 --> 00:52:15,476
<i>Now I intend that</i>
<i>when all the bickering and battling is over,</i>

759
00:52:15,564 --> 00:52:18,032
<i>the supreme victor shall be our race,</i>

760
00:52:18,124 --> 00:52:19,523
<i>the Daleks.</i>

761
00:52:20,244 --> 00:52:22,155
<i>At this very moment,</i>

762
00:52:22,244 --> 00:52:26,635
<i>the production lines stand ready,</i>
<i>totally automated, fully programmed.</i>

763
00:52:27,604 --> 00:52:29,913
<i>The Daleks are no longer dependent on us.</i>

764
00:52:30,004 --> 00:52:33,758
<i>The machinery is ready.</i>
<i>They are a power in their own right.</i>

765
00:52:35,164 --> 00:52:39,157
<i>If any one of you would destroy</i>
<i>everything that we have ever achieved,</i>

766
00:52:39,244 --> 00:52:40,882
<i>then here...</i>

767
00:52:43,044 --> 00:52:44,841
<i>is a destruct button.</i>

768
00:52:45,804 --> 00:52:49,922
<i>Press it and you will destroy this bunker</i>
<i>and everything in it.</i>

769
00:52:50,364 --> 00:52:52,434
<i>Only this room will remain.</i>

770
00:52:53,484 --> 00:52:57,841
<i>Press it and you will wipe out our entire race,</i>
<i>destroy the Daleks forever.</i>

771
00:52:58,764 --> 00:53:01,119
<i>Which of you will do it?</i>

772
00:53:05,004 --> 00:53:07,313
<i>You are men without courage.</i>

773
00:53:08,404 --> 00:53:11,077
<i>You have lost your right to survive.</i>

774
00:53:16,104 --> 00:53:18,174
You have heard Davros' case.

775
00:53:18,264 --> 00:53:20,414
What he has not made clear
is that there is another way.

776
00:53:20,504 --> 00:53:22,017
<i>There is no other way.</i>

777
00:53:22,104 --> 00:53:23,981
Production of the Dalek can continue.

778
00:53:24,064 --> 00:53:26,373
We can destroy
the genetically conditioned creatures

779
00:53:26,464 --> 00:53:28,932
and allow the mutation to follow its own course.

780
00:53:29,024 --> 00:53:32,983
Our race will survive if it deserves to survive.

781
00:53:33,424 --> 00:53:36,734
But let it have all the strengths
and weaknesses that we have,

782
00:53:36,824 --> 00:53:38,337
compassion and hate.

783
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,858
Let it do good things and evil.

784
00:53:40,944 --> 00:53:44,823
But we cannot let it become
an unfeeling, heartless machine.

785
00:53:45,104 --> 00:53:47,743
That is our choice. Now...

786
00:53:49,344 --> 00:53:50,777
we must decide.

787
00:53:52,424 --> 00:53:55,621
-We've got to find that time ring.
-SARAH: Doctor.

788
00:53:58,584 --> 00:54:00,381
Good girl, Sarah.

789
00:54:00,464 --> 00:54:03,536
Now all we need is the tape recorder.
So keep an eye on Nyder.

790
00:54:03,624 --> 00:54:06,184
<i>You've heard our cases.</i>

791
00:54:06,264 --> 00:54:08,380
<i>I will give you two minutes to decide.</i>

792
00:54:08,464 --> 00:54:11,262
<i>Then you must answer not only to me,</i>
<i>but to the future.</i>

793
00:54:25,784 --> 00:54:28,139
<i>You've had ample time to decide.</i>

794
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:31,853
<i>Those who would remain loyal to me</i>
<i>and to the future of our race,</i>

795
00:54:31,944 --> 00:54:34,458
<i>move forward and stand at my side.</i>

796
00:54:46,624 --> 00:54:49,855
Now, I wonder where Nyder is going
at such a crucial moment.

797
00:54:49,944 --> 00:54:52,617
-I think we ought to find out.
-So do I.

798
00:54:53,304 --> 00:54:54,703
Let's go.

799
00:55:26,864 --> 00:55:29,173
Right, bring out the explosives.

800
00:55:29,624 --> 00:55:33,173
Now, lay the charges
on each of these main carriers.

801
00:55:33,264 --> 00:55:36,256
One charge for each beam should be enough.

802
00:55:44,184 --> 00:55:46,015
Now, where are you going in such a hurry?

803
00:55:46,204 --> 00:55:48,096
Davros is lost. I am getting away while I can.

804
00:55:49,184 --> 00:55:50,458
Oh.

805
00:55:50,544 --> 00:55:52,500
Somehow that just doesn't ring true.

806
00:55:52,584 --> 00:55:55,144
Why didn't you just join the other side?

807
00:55:55,224 --> 00:55:58,899
Now, that's a good question.
Do you have a good answer?

808
00:55:58,984 --> 00:55:59,576
Evidently not.

809
00:55:59,664 --> 00:56:04,101
Well, then let's try something else.
That tape recorder you took. Where is it?

810
00:56:04,184 --> 00:56:07,460
It's put away in a safe in Davros' office.

811
00:56:09,544 --> 00:56:12,820
-Shall we go and see?
-Down here.

812
00:56:18,244 --> 00:56:21,438
Are you quite sure
this is the only way into the bunker?

813
00:56:21,524 --> 00:56:24,163
Well, the only other way was from the Kaled dome

814
00:56:24,244 --> 00:56:27,475
and your war rocket caved that in.
It can never be cleared.

815
00:56:27,564 --> 00:56:31,352
If we do the same here, we'll entomb
the Daleks and those who created them.

816
00:56:31,444 --> 00:56:35,642
But Sarah and the Doctor are inside.
You'll give them a chance to get clear, won't you?

817
00:56:35,724 --> 00:56:38,716
I must blow the roof
as soon as the charges are laid. I can't delay.

818
00:56:38,804 --> 00:56:41,034
If the Daleks find out
what we are doing and attack,

819
00:56:41,124 --> 00:56:44,002
I don't have enough men or arms
to stand them off.

820
00:56:44,084 --> 00:56:46,962
-How long?
-Thirty minutes, perhaps less.

821
00:56:47,044 --> 00:56:51,242
-Then I must get inside and try and warn them.
-That's up to you.

822
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:54,077
But you must understand,
if you're not back, I must go on.

823
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:57,474
-You'll die in there with them.
-I understand.

824
00:56:57,564 --> 00:56:59,475
I'll give you what time I can.

825
00:56:59,924 --> 00:57:01,118
Right.

826
00:57:10,684 --> 00:57:12,242
Thank you.

827
00:57:12,324 --> 00:57:14,201
Now, let's destroy it.

828
00:57:19,244 --> 00:57:21,963
-How about this?
-How very apt.

829
00:57:22,444 --> 00:57:24,116
A Dalek gun.

830
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:28,793
There.

831
00:57:36,364 --> 00:57:37,922
He's not important.

832
00:57:38,004 --> 00:57:41,838
We've got the time ring, we've destroyed the tape
and Davros' power is broken.

833
00:57:41,924 --> 00:57:44,074
What about the Daleks
that are already operational?

834
00:57:44,164 --> 00:57:48,203
Oh, I think we can leave Gharman to destroy them.

835
00:58:11,344 --> 00:58:14,017
-Why is it going on so long?
-Who knows?

836
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:18,099
It's out of character for Davros

<i>This is your last chance. Move to join me now.</i>

838
00:58:21,944 --> 00:58:23,021
<i>Or suffer the consequences.</i>

839
00:58:23,104 --> 00:58:26,733
Why don't you just accept the fact
that you have lost? It's over for you, Davros.

840
00:58:26,824 --> 00:58:30,134
<i>Do you believe that I would let a lifetime's work</i>

841
00:58:30,224 --> 00:58:33,375
<i>be ended by the will of spineless fools like you?</i>

842
00:58:33,584 --> 00:58:35,302
<i>You have won nothing.</i>

843
00:58:35,384 --> 00:58:39,138
<i>I allowed this charade to be played out</i>
<i>for one reason only.</i>

844
00:58:39,344 --> 00:58:42,336
<i>To find those men who were truly loyal to me</i>

845
00:58:42,424 --> 00:58:45,655
<i>and to discover those who would betray me!</i>

846
00:58:46,104 --> 00:58:47,139
<i>We...</i>

847
00:58:47,224 --> 00:58:49,658
<i>I will go on!</i>

848
00:58:49,744 --> 00:58:52,497
You are insane, Davros.

849
00:59:05,744 --> 00:59:07,496

00:59:07,904 --> 00:59:09,895
<i>Exterminate!</i>

<i>Exterminate!</i>

852
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:22,301
Stop them, Davros. You must stop them.

853
00:59:37,724 --> 00:59:40,682
-That's the last one in position.
-Right. Prepare to detonate.

854
01:00:00,324 --> 01:00:03,077
<i>The automated Dalek production line</i>
<i>has been started.</i>

855
01:00:03,164 --> 01:00:05,803
<i>I gave no such order. Who did?</i>

856
01:00:05,884 --> 01:00:07,840
DALEK: <i>I gave the command.</i>

857
01:00:08,444 --> 01:00:11,641
<i>You will perform no function</i>
<i>unless ordered by me.</i>

858
01:00:14,204 --> 01:00:16,320
<i>You will obey only my commands.</i>

859
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:19,043
<i>The production line is to be halted immediately.</i>

860
01:00:20,604 --> 01:00:23,164
<i>You heard my order. Obey!</i>

861
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:26,517
<i>Obey!</i>

862
01:00:27,804 --> 01:00:31,274
<i>I created you! I am the master, not you!</i>

863
01:00:31,364 --> 01:00:34,003
<i>I. I. I!</i>

864
01:00:38,664 --> 01:00:40,620
<i>-Nyder.</i>
-Yes, Davros.

865
01:00:44,024 --> 01:00:46,458
<i>Production will continue.</i>

866
01:00:48,744 --> 01:00:51,042
DALEK: <i>Our programming does not permit us</i>

867
01:00:51,124 --> 01:00:57,039
<i>to acknowledge that any creature</i>
<i>is superior to the Daleks.</i>

868
01:00:57,124 --> 01:00:59,054
<i>You cannot exist without me.</i>

869
01:00:59,084 --> 01:01:00,881
<i>All inferior creatures</i>

870
01:01:00,964 --> 01:01:05,674
<i>are to be considered the enemy of the Daleks</i>
<i>and destroyed.</i>

871
01:01:05,764 --> 01:01:06,280
<i>No, wait!</i>

872
01:01:06,364 --> 01:01:08,355
<i>Exterminate!</i>

873
01:01:11,244 --> 01:01:14,839
<i>For the last time, I am your creator!</i>

874
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:19,083
<i>You must, you will obey me!</i>

875
01:01:19,244 --> 01:01:21,553
<i>We obey no one.</i>

876
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:24,841
<i>We are the superior beings.</i>

877
01:01:25,444 --> 01:01:27,480
<i>Exterminate!</i>

01:01:37,984 --> 01:01:41,215

882
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,662
<i>This is only the beginning.</i>

883
01:01:44,744 --> 01:01:49,101
<i>We will prepare. We will grow stronger.</i>

884
01:01:49,544 --> 01:01:53,014
<i>When the time is right, we will emerge</i>

885
01:01:53,104 --> 01:01:55,413

886
01:01:55,504 --> 01:01:57,813

<i>that although the Daleks will create</i>

891
01:02:11,464 --> 01:02:14,103
<i>I know also that out of their evil</i>

(SARAH GRUNTS)

894
01:02:36,367 --> 01:02:39,040
Thank heaven for that. We've made it.

895
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,446
-Haven't we?
-Of course we've made it.

896
01:02:41,527 --> 01:02:42,676
Did you think we wouldn't?

897
01:02:42,767 --> 01:02:44,917
Well, in these past few weeks, yes.

898
01:02:45,007 --> 01:02:45,996
-Quite frequently.
-There is really nothing

899
01:02:46,087 --> 01:02:50,603
that could go wrong with the time ring,
except the molecular short circuit.

900
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:52,200
-Doctor.
-Yes?

901
01:02:52,647 --> 01:02:54,558
The Tardis isn't here.

902
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:58,207
Well, it probably hasn't arrived yet.
We're a little early.

903
01:02:58,287 --> 01:02:59,402
Hasn't arrived yet?

904
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:02,399
No, you see, the Tardis is drifting back
through time, Harry.

905
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,239
We'll just have to wait
for it to turn up.

906

(CHUCKLES)

907
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:06,800
I say, Doctor,
did you want this ring thing?

908
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:07,922
-What, that?
-Yes.

909
01:03:08,007 --> 01:03:09,884
-No.
-Oh, well, I'd rather like to have it.

910
01:03:09,967 --> 01:03:14,245
-Well, you take good care of it, Harry.
-Of course I will. Thank you.

01:03:17,607 --> 01:03:20,440
You knew that was gonna happen,
didn't you?

913
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:33,404
-He's dead. Been dead some time.
-How long?

914
01:03:33,807 --> 01:03:35,399
A week or two, I'd say.

915
01:03:35,487 --> 01:03:37,443
There's very little sign
of putrefaction though.

Sterile atmosphere.

917
01:03:38,807 --> 01:03:41,367
Yes, exactly, and no sign of injury.

918
01:03:41,447 --> 01:03:43,005
Nothing to indicate the cause of death.

919
01:03:43,087 --> 01:03:47,046
Well, he was just sitting against
the door as though he'd collapsed.

920
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:49,880
He wouldn't have been there
for two weeks unless...

921
01:03:49,967 --> 01:03:51,320
Unless what?

922
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:54,604
Unless there was something
seriously wrong here.

923
01:03:55,047 --> 01:03:56,366
