1
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:45,757
Nothing can be done for this chap.

2
00:00:45,847 --> 00:00:47,599
That's strange.

3
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:49,962
There's centuries between these two weapons.

4
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:53,725
What's that on his jacket?

5
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:57,595
Radiation detector and a gas mask.
The two things don't go together, do they?

6
00:00:57,687 --> 00:01:00,804
It's like finding remains of a stone age man
with a transistor radio.

7
00:01:00,887 --> 00:01:02,400
Playing rock music.

8
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:04,125
A 1 ,000 year war?

9
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:07,165
-Civilisation on the point of collapse.
-What?

10
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:09,715
Nothing. Just theorising, that's all.

11
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:13,399
-Come along.
-Where are we going?

12
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:14,926
Er...

13
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:17,046
forward.

14
00:01:40,587 --> 00:01:43,021
Even the dead have a part to play.

15
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:45,826
Propped up to make
the trenches appear fully manned.

16
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:49,980
-Different sort of uniform from that other chap's.
-Yes. We may have crossed the lines.

17
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:53,616
-Same mixture of ancient and modern, though.
-Yes.

18
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:56,505
That's why I think this war
has being going on for a very long time.

19
00:01:56,587 --> 00:02:00,546
They probably started out with the most modern
equipment but no longer have the resources.

20
00:02:00,627 --> 00:02:03,744
-Have to make do.
-War of attrition, eh? Only backwards.

21
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:06,295
At this rate, they're going to finish up with
bows and arrows.

22
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:08,264
Well, it would explain the mixture of equipment.

23
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:09,706
Psst.

24
00:02:09,787 --> 00:02:12,506
-Be careful, Sarah.
-It's all right.

25
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:15,226
-It's locked.
-It's pretty solid, isn't it?

26
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:17,263
Some kind of service tunnel, I suppose.

27
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,059
It might even lead into the dome.

28
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:20,899
Let's see where the trench leads.

29
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,263
(PROJECTILE WHISTLING)

30
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:35,302
-It's a gas shell.
-Gas!

31
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:37,622
-Poison gas.
-Respirators, quick.

32
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:45,859
Get back!

33
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,224
This one's alive. Get him inside.

34
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:12,504
There's another one here.

35
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:15,585
Get him inside. Quickly.

36
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:34,145
They don't look like Thals.

37
00:03:36,307 --> 00:03:37,899
I wonder...

38
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:41,502
There have been rumours recently
that the Thals were developing robots.

39
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:43,942
Anyway, stick them on the transporter.

40
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:46,905
I shall alert command headquarters
with General Ravon.

41
00:03:49,907 --> 00:03:52,023
Count the ammunition and clean your weapons.

42
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:16,735
Well?

43
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:18,818
Two prisoners, sir, captured section 1 01 .

44
00:04:18,907 --> 00:04:21,182
For interrogation. Good.

45
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:22,946
I enjoy interrogation.

46
00:04:23,027 --> 00:04:24,460
Yes, you look the type.

47
00:04:24,587 --> 00:04:27,147
You insolent muto.

48
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:28,501
-Sir.
-What?

49
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:31,977
My section totally destroyed the Thal attackers
except for these two.

50
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:35,343
-But our supply of ammunition is running low.
-Then conserve it.

51
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:37,861
Ammunition is valuable and cannot be wasted.

52
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:39,744
-Yes, sir.
-For instance,

53
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:42,944
when I've finished with these two animals,
they'll be hanged.

54
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:45,382
Not taken out and shot as in the past.

55
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:47,935
And that will be all. Return to your unit.

56
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:51,826
So...

57
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:55,661
the Thals have come down to recruiting mutos,
have they?

58
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,544
Turn out your pockets.

59
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:00,621
Certainly.

60
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,337
It might take some time.

61
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:20,025
RAVON: Take a good look.

62
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:23,417
In a few weeks we're gonna change
the shape of that map forever.

63
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:26,943
We'll wipe the Thals from the face of Skaro.

64
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,824
-Yes, I've heard that before.
-What?

65
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:32,343
I was just wondering how you propose
to wipe the Thals from the face of Skaro

66
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:35,499
with boy solders, no ammunition
and very young generals.

67
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:37,623
You've had one warning about your insults.

68
00:05:37,707 --> 00:05:38,822
(MACHINE BUZZING)

69
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:40,818
-I do beg your pardon.
-When victory is ours,

70
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:45,264
we'll wipe every trace of the Thals and their city
from the face of this land.

71
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:47,863
We will avenge the deaths of all Kaleds

72
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,381
who've fallen in the cause of right and justice

73
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:53,823
and build a peace which will be a monument
to their sacrifice.

74
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:59,056
Our battle cry will be
''Total extermination of the Thals!''

75
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:01,545
That's very impressive.

76
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,460
You mean you're going to sweep
these wastelands absolutely...

77
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:08,861
Harry.

78
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,578
Did I hurt your fingers?

79
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,784
-You'll never get out of here alive.
-Yes, so you said.

80
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:21,778
So you're Kaleds, eh?

81
00:06:24,627 --> 00:06:28,302
Even you mutos know the difference between
Thals and Kaleds.

82
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,218
K-A-L-E-D-S.

83
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,979
Why, that's an anagram of...

84
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:33,785
How interesting. Are you fit, Harry?

85
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,903
-Never felt fitter, Doctor.
-Good.

86
00:06:35,987 --> 00:06:37,898
Now, Alexander the Great,

87
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:40,501
-you're going to lead us out of here.
-Never!

88
00:06:40,587 --> 00:06:42,657
You won't get any medals
for being stupid, General.

89
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:45,625
In fact, you won't be getting any more medals
for anything.

90
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:50,175
-Where do you want me to take you?
-Back to the wastelands.

91
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,546
Yes, that's home to you mutos, isn't it?

92
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:58,380
-But you won't get that far, I promise you.
-Come on, we're wasting time.

93
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:07,338
(COUGHING)

94
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:10,735
Doctor?

95
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,255
Doctor?

96
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,455
Harry?

97
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,503
HARRY: Where are we?
This isn't leading to the surface.

98
00:07:48,587 --> 00:07:51,579
There's a platform lift at the end.
You mutos must have seen it.

99
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:54,977
You're still making the same mistake.
We're not mutos, whatever they may be.

100
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,900
-Only mutos live in the wastelands.
-Come on!

101
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:07,066
-Sarah's all right?
-Yes.

102
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:09,263
If you've a friend up there,
they won't last much longer.

103
00:08:09,347 --> 00:08:10,621
What do you mean?

104
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:13,983
Night's coming on.
The mutos start moving at night.

105
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:22,179
Just remember, we're your friends.

106
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:32,540
General Ravon.

107
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:34,697
-Nyder.
-I wish to see you.

108
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:37,745
If you'll wait in my office, Nyder,
I'll be a few minutes.

109
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:42,456
Perhaps you should introduce us, General.

110
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:44,938
Security Commander Nyder.

111
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:46,506
You're civilians, I see.

112
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,336
Yes, but we're not staying long.

113
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,227
-Don't let us detain you.
-You won't.

114
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:04,826
Down, Ravon!

115
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:16,660
Alert all guards.
Two Thal intruders in the command complex.

116
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:19,063
(ALARM SOUNDING)

117
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:26,303
This way, Harry. Come on.

118
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:33,385
They took me by surprise.

119
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:35,059
Fool.

120
00:09:35,147 --> 00:09:39,220
What kind of soldier lets two unarmed prisoners
overpower him in his own headquarters?

121
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:41,741
There's something different about those two.

122
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:44,022
They're not Thals and they're not mutos.

123
00:09:44,107 --> 00:09:46,826
We'll find out what's different about them...

124
00:09:46,907 --> 00:09:48,386
by autopsy.

125
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:58,864
-We're trapped.
-Yes.

126
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:04,305
After you.

127
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:24,419
Alert surface patrols to watch for intruders
in the area of platform lift 7.

128
00:10:28,707 --> 00:10:30,220
-Now what?
-Keep running.

129
00:10:30,307 --> 00:10:32,059
-What?
-Keep running!

130
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:03,341
Down, Harry!

131
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:11,781
-Are you all right?
-That was a lucky escape.

132
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:15,258
I wouldn't say that, Harry.

133
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:31,982
Doctor?

134
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:33,736
Harry?

135
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:37,502
Doctor.

136
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:38,902
Harry.

137
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:21,106
-This is yours?
-Yes.

138
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:23,178
What is its function?

139
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:25,576
Well, it's an etheric beam locator.

140
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:29,145
It's also useful for detecting
ion-charged emissions.

141
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:30,695
Oh, really.

142
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:33,498
It is not of Thal manufacture.

143
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,543
Well, naturally not.

144
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:37,583
My friend and I are not from your planet.

145
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,419
-Aliens?
-Humans.

146
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:42,018
Well, I am anyway.

147
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:45,622
I've heard Davros say
there is no intelligent life on other planets.

148
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:48,343
So either he is wrong or you are lying.

149
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:51,385
-We are not lying...
-And Davros is never wrong about anything.

150
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:54,385
Well, he must be exceptional.
Even I am occasionally wrong about some things.

151
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:56,298
Who is this Davros?

152
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:58,423
Our greatest scientist.

153
00:12:59,787 --> 00:13:02,221
He's in charge of all research at the bunker.

154
00:13:02,307 --> 00:13:04,184
They could be mutos, Nyder.

155
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:07,225
Intelligent mutos who've developed a technology.

156
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,264
Tell me...

157
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:12,224
what exactly are mutos?

158
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:20,499
Mutos are the scarred relics of ourselves.

159
00:13:21,987 --> 00:13:26,822
Monsters created by the chemical weapons
used in the first century of this war.

160
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:31,496
They were banished into the wastelands
where they live and...

161
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:33,339
scavenge like animals.

162
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:37,545
-In other words, genetically wounded.
-We must keep the Kaled race pure.

163
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:41,062
Imperfects are rejected.

164
00:13:42,027 --> 00:13:44,222
Some of them survive out there.

165
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:46,822
-That's a very harsh policy.
-It's horrible.

166
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:49,264
Your views are not important.

167
00:13:51,827 --> 00:13:56,855
General Ravon, I'll take these two back to
the bunker for interrogation by the special unit.

168
00:13:56,947 --> 00:14:00,417
-They're the army's prisoners.
-Then you will release them to me.

169
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:04,819
The special unit will get more out of them
than your crude methods ever would.

170
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:07,262
-Very well, if you insist.
-I do insist, General.

171
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:12,057
And I have a list of requirements here.

172
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:15,901
All these items are to be sent
to the bunker immediately.

173
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:17,985
I can't spare this equipment.

174
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:20,627
These spare parts alone would take
more than half my supply.

175
00:14:20,707 --> 00:14:24,541
You'll notice the requisition
is countersigned by Davros himself.

176
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:28,099
If you would like to take the matter up with him...

177
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:30,655
I'm expected to fight a war without equipment.

178
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:34,627
Very well,
I'll have these things out to the bunker by dawn.

179
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,982
By midnight, General.

180
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:39,501
The order specifies midnight.

181
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:42,338
-By midnight.
-Good.

182
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:47,738
Bring the prisoners.

183
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,146
Ready, Davros.

184
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:47,260
<i>Observe the test closely, my friend.</i>

185
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:52,139
<i>This will be a moment that will live in history.</i>

186
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:06,625
DAVROS: <i>Halt.</i>

187
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,739
<i>Turn right.</i>

188
00:16:09,027 --> 00:16:10,380
<i>Halt.</i>

189
00:16:11,427 --> 00:16:13,099
<i>Now...</i>

190
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:14,825
<i>exterminate.</i>

191
00:16:18,907 --> 00:16:19,896
<i>Perfect.</i>

192
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:23,786
<i>The weaponry is perfect.</i>

193
00:16:24,427 --> 00:16:26,304
<i>Now we can begin.</i>

194
00:52:50,747 --> 00:52:53,181
(DOCTOR WHO THEME)

195
00:53:47,627 --> 00:53:50,266
(GUNS FIRING)

196
00:54:26,707 --> 00:54:27,935
Ah.

197
00:54:28,747 --> 00:54:30,499
Welcome, Doctor.

198
00:54:30,587 --> 00:54:32,225
What's going on?

199
00:54:32,307 --> 00:54:35,936
Don't you realise how dangerous it is
to intercept a transmat beam?

200
00:54:36,027 --> 00:54:39,417
Oh, come, Doctor, not with our techniques.

201
00:54:39,507 --> 00:54:43,705
We Time Lords transcended such simple
mechanical devices

202
00:54:43,787 --> 00:54:46,426
when the universe was less than
half its present size.

203
00:54:46,507 --> 00:54:49,465
Look, whatever I've done for you in the past...

204
00:54:49,547 --> 00:54:51,219
I've more than made up for.

205
00:54:51,307 --> 00:54:54,299
I will not tolerate
this continual interference in my life.

206
00:54:54,387 --> 00:54:57,936
Continual? We pride ourselves
we seldom interfere in the affairs of others.

207
00:54:58,027 --> 00:55:00,336
-Except mine.
-You, Doctor, are a special case.

208
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:04,864
You enjoy the freedom we allow you.
In return, occasionally, not continually,

209
00:55:04,947 --> 00:55:07,415
-we ask you to do something for us.
-I won't do it.

210
00:55:07,507 --> 00:55:10,180
-Whatever it is, I refuse.
-Daleks.

211
00:55:10,267 --> 00:55:12,303
Daleks? Tell me more.

212
00:55:12,787 --> 00:55:16,541
We foresee a time
when they will have destroyed all other life forms

213
00:55:16,627 --> 00:55:18,902
and become the dominant creature
in the universe.

214
00:55:18,987 --> 00:55:21,899
-That's possible? Tell on.
-We'd like you

215
00:55:21,987 --> 00:55:25,775
to return to Skaro at a point in time
before the Daleks evolved.

216
00:55:25,867 --> 00:55:27,778
Do you mean avert their creation?

217
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:32,065
Or affect their genetic development
so that they evolve into less aggressive creatures.

218
00:55:32,187 --> 00:55:34,178
Hmm. That's feasible.

219
00:55:34,267 --> 00:55:36,098
Alternatively...

220
00:55:36,187 --> 00:55:38,462
if you learn enough about their very beginnings,

221
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:40,617
you might discover some inherent weakness.

222
00:55:40,707 --> 00:55:42,937
All right, just one more time.

223
00:55:43,027 --> 00:55:44,426
-You'll do it?
-Yes.

224
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,305
If you'll let me have the space-time coordinates,
I'll set the Tardis for Skaro.

225
00:55:47,387 --> 00:55:49,537
There's no need for that, Doctor.

226
00:55:49,627 --> 00:55:52,346
You're here. This is Skaro.

227
00:55:52,587 --> 00:55:53,815
What?

228
00:55:53,907 --> 00:55:56,944
We thought it would save time
if we assumed your agreement.

229
00:55:58,267 --> 00:56:00,178
-What's this?
-A time ring.

230
00:56:00,267 --> 00:56:03,657
It will return you to the Tardis
when you've finished here.

231
00:56:04,387 --> 00:56:06,537
-There's just one thing.
-What's that?

232
00:56:06,627 --> 00:56:10,097
Be careful not to lose it.
That time ring is your lifeline.

233
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:13,983
-Good luck, Doctor.
-Just a moment.

234
00:56:14,987 --> 00:56:16,625
Don't just disappear.

235
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,696
What about Sarah and Harry?

236
00:56:27,427 --> 00:56:28,655
Doctor?

237
00:56:28,747 --> 00:56:31,898
-Doctor!
-Ah, there you are, Sarah.

238
00:56:31,987 --> 00:56:34,217
That was a pretty rough landing. What happened?

239
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:37,777
-Yes, where are we? This isn't the beacon.
-No, there's been a slight change of plan.

240
00:56:37,867 --> 00:56:39,061
(EXPLOSIVE RUMBLING)

241
00:56:39,147 --> 00:56:40,341
This is Skaro.

242
00:56:40,427 --> 00:56:42,463
-What's that? It's gunfire.
-Heavy artillery.

243
00:56:42,547 --> 00:56:46,938
-Doctor, it's getting closer!
-It's a creeping barrage. Get down!

244
00:56:56,107 --> 00:56:57,938
Something's annoyed them.

245
00:57:00,027 --> 00:57:01,585
(SARAH SCREAMING)

246
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,383
Doctor. Doctor, look.

247
00:57:16,427 --> 00:57:17,860
All right.

248
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,936
Part of his uniform is made of animal skins

249
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:52,900
and yet the combat jacket
is a modern synthetic fibre.

250
00:58:49,747 --> 00:58:51,783
-Halt, don't move.
-What is it?

251
00:58:51,867 --> 00:58:53,619
DOCTOR: I see a land mine.

252
00:58:55,147 --> 00:58:56,944
We're in the middle of a minefield.

253
00:58:59,107 --> 00:59:01,143
Follow me and tread in my footsteps.

254
00:59:01,227 --> 00:59:03,138
Good King Wenceslas.

255
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:13,981
-What?
-I thought I saw something move.

256
00:59:16,307 --> 00:59:18,138
I have a feeling we're being watched.

257
00:59:18,227 --> 00:59:20,104
I get that feeling, too.

258
00:59:20,187 --> 00:59:22,337
HARRY: I can't see anything.

259
00:59:22,427 --> 00:59:24,224
DOCTOR: Let's hope it's imagination.

260
00:59:27,027 --> 00:59:28,301
What is it?

261
00:59:28,387 --> 00:59:30,184
Harry, I'm standing on a land mine.

262
00:59:32,187 --> 00:59:33,666
I felt it shift.

263
00:59:33,747 --> 00:59:35,658
If I move my foot, it might detonate it.

264
00:59:35,747 --> 00:59:38,102
-Don't move your foot.
-I won't.

265
00:59:56,587 --> 01:00:00,057
-HARRY: It's rocking.
-Wedge something under it, make it firm.

266
01:00:00,147 --> 01:00:02,058
Yes, I'm trying to, Sarah.

267
01:00:03,947 --> 01:00:05,778
Back up, Sarah.

268
01:00:06,427 --> 01:00:09,817
You back up, too, Harry.
No point in risking both our lives.

269
01:00:09,907 --> 01:00:12,626
No, Doctor, you'll have a better chance
if I hold it firm.

270
01:00:12,707 --> 01:00:14,823
Please, Harry, don't be difficult.

271
01:00:14,907 --> 01:00:16,704
Don't you argue, Doctor.

272
01:00:26,067 --> 01:00:27,546
Now...

273
01:00:27,987 --> 01:00:30,455
just lift your foot very, very gently.

274
01:00:50,027 --> 01:00:52,495
-Thank you, Harry.
-My pleasure.

275
01:00:53,027 --> 01:00:54,585
Let's go.

276
01:01:07,467 --> 01:01:08,616
Hey, look.

277
01:01:11,787 --> 01:01:13,857
What do you think?

278
01:01:13,947 --> 01:01:15,619
SARAH: It's like a big bubble.

279
01:01:15,707 --> 01:01:18,016
DOCTOR: Protective dome.
SARAH: What?

280
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:21,099
SARAH: Large enough to cover an entire city?
DOCTOR: Yes.

281
01:01:21,187 --> 01:01:23,143
Why are they fighting with old-fashioned things

282
01:01:23,227 --> 01:01:26,981
like barbed wire and land mines
if they can build something like that?
