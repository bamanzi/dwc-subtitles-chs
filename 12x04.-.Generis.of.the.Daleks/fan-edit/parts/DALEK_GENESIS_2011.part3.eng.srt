1
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:29,546
I've just had word
from one of our supporters in the dome.

2
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:32,267
Councillor Mogran has called a secret meeting.

3
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:36,819
The only councillors invited are known opponents
of the work we are doing here in the bunker.

4
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:39,581
<i>I want a full report</i>
<i>on everything that was discussed.</i>

5
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:42,466
<i>I don't care how you get the information, get it.</i>

6
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:46,224
<i>I think we need not be too concerned.</i>

7
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:50,779
<i>Many times in the last 50 years, factions</i>
<i>of the government have tried to interfere</i>

8
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:53,382
<i>with my research here, they have failed.</i>

9
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:55,106
<i>They will fail again.</i>

10
00:14:55,828 --> 00:15:00,618
There's something else. The two prisoners in
Ronson's charge, they've been seen at the dome.

11
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,381
-They are at the meeting.
<i>-Impossible!</i>

12
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:07,787
<i>-There is no escape from here.</i>
-I've checked their cells. They are missing.

13
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:16,861
<i>Find out how they escaped</i>
<i>and report to me immediately.</i>

14
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:21,100
-What action shall I take concerning Ronson?
<i>-For the moment, none.</i>

15
00:15:21,668 --> 00:15:24,387
<i>I will deal with him in my own way.</i>

16
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:33,184
-That was a very impressive speech, Doctor.
-Yes, it was meant to be.

17
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:34,667
Let's hope it's convinced them.

18
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:37,899
Yes, let's hope so, Harry.
Sometimes words aren't enough.

19
00:15:37,988 --> 00:15:40,502
Well, they seem to have reached a decision.

20
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:48,385
I'm afraid, Doctor, the councillors could not agree
to halt all experimentation at the bunker.

21
00:15:48,468 --> 00:15:51,380
-The councillors are fools.
-Let me finish, please.

22
00:15:51,468 --> 00:15:53,823
It has been agreed that an independent tribunal

23
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:56,263
will investigate all work
that is being done at the bunker.

24
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:57,747
But that could take months.

25
00:15:57,828 --> 00:16:00,183
Davros already has several
prototype Daleks ready for action.

26
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:02,736
It has also been agreed that,
pending the investigation,

27
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,547
Davros' experiments will be suspended.

28
00:16:05,628 --> 00:16:07,346
It is less than I'd hoped for.

29
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:10,824
And I promise you, Doctor,
if your allegations are borne out,

30
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:14,418
-all work at the bunker will be closed down.
-Thank you.

31
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:19,342
And now I must go with my committee
and inform Davros of our decision.

32
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,017
I think it's high time
we looked for Sarah, don't you?

33
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:26,545
-The one you left behind in the wastelands?
-Yes, you have some news of her?

34
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:29,377
I can't be certain, you understand?

35
00:16:29,468 --> 00:16:33,461
But our agents inside the Thal dome
report a newly arrived girl prisoner

36
00:16:33,548 --> 00:16:36,699
who led an attempted break-out.
Gave the Thals quite a bit of trouble.

37
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,938
-That'll be her.
-In the Thal dome, you say?

38
00:16:39,028 --> 00:16:43,146
The Thals are using prisoners
to load their last great rocket.

39
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:46,140
-Rocket?
-They think they'll win the war with it.

40
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:49,061
What they don't know is that
no matter how powerful their rocket,

41
00:16:49,148 --> 00:16:51,264
it cannot penetrate our protective dome.

42
00:16:51,348 --> 00:16:54,385
Only a matter of months ago,
Davros perfected a new substance

43
00:16:54,468 --> 00:16:56,902
which has the strength
of 30-foot thick reinforced concrete.

44
00:16:56,988 --> 00:17:00,537
Yes, well, never mind about that.
Could you help us to find Sarah?

45
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:05,702
One of my agents could lead you
into the service shaft underneath the Thal city.

46
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:09,258
-But after that, you're strictly on your own.
-Fair enough.

47
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:12,966
Right, I'll give you a map
showing how to reach the rocket silo area.

48
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:13,756
Thank you.

49
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:17,857
<i>An investigation? But of course, Mogran.</i>

50
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:23,544
<i>I welcome any inquiry into our work here.</i>
<i>I think the idea is an excellent one.</i>

51
00:17:24,728 --> 00:17:29,677
There's one thing more.
Until the inquiry, all work is to be suspended.

52
00:17:29,888 --> 00:17:33,278
<i>If that is your wish, then naturally I will obey.</i>

53
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,398
<i>It will take some time</i>
<i>to close down certain pieces of equipment.</i>

54
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:40,241
<i>Shall we say 24 hours?</i>

55
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:45,524
-Twelve.
<i>-It will be difficult but it will be done.</i>

56
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:48,880
The members of the tribunal
will arrive in that time.

57
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:00,499
We cannot allow this investigation!

58
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:03,500
They cannot fail to see the dangers
to themselves in the Dalek project.

59
00:18:03,588 --> 00:18:05,738
<i>Calm yourself, Nyder.</i>

60
00:18:05,828 --> 00:18:09,184
<i>-There will be no investigation.</i>
-But you can't stop it now.

61
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:11,020
<i>I can and will!</i>

62
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:15,067
<i>The Council has signed the death warrant</i>
<i>of the whole of the Kaled people.</i>

63
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:19,585
<i>Only we, the Elite, we and the Daleks will go on.</i>

64
00:18:20,828 --> 00:18:24,503
The whole of the Kaled people?
You would go that far?

65
00:18:24,828 --> 00:18:26,500
<i>Did you ever doubt it?</i>

66
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:28,617
No.

67
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:31,340
<i>There is much to do.</i>

68
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:36,385
<i>I want the genetically conditioned creatures</i>
<i>installed in the machines immediately.</i>

69
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:37,981
<i>-20 of them.</i>
-20?

70
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:42,744
<i>-They are our troops in this battle for survival.</i>
-But they are still very erratic, unstable.

71
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:45,501
<i>They will not be allowed self-control.</i>

72
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:49,697
<i>I will prepare a computer program</i>
<i>that will limit their actions.</i>

73
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:54,227
<i>After that, we are going on a journey.</i>

74
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:09,000
-You think they believed you?
<i>-It is unimportant.</i>

75
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:11,158
<i>They are hungry for victory.</i>

76
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:15,719
<i>They will use the formula and fire their rocket</i>
<i>no matter what they believe my motives to be.</i>

77
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:19,562
<i>And when they do, Nyder, when they do...</i>

78
00:19:25,648 --> 00:19:28,799
I've given orders that a barrage
of shells containing the formula

79
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:30,640
should begin as soon as possible.

80
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:33,083
The rocket launch can begin immediately.

81
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:36,725
And now I'll arrange
your safe escort out of the city.

82
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:47,481
Doctor, somehow we've got to warn Mogran
and the other Kaled leaders.

83
00:19:47,568 --> 00:19:51,117
Yes, and we haven't found Sarah yet. Come on.

84
00:19:58,128 --> 00:20:01,165
Excuse me, can you help me? I'm a spy.

85
00:20:04,688 --> 00:20:06,406
Their suits, Harry.

86
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:29,081
-Harry! Doc...
-You all right, Sarah?

87
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,166
Oh! I am now. Listen, we've got to get out of here.

88
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:35,320
-The Thals are going to launch this rocket...
-I know. Listen.

89
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:38,047
I want you and Harry to go back
to the Kaled dome. Harry knows the way.

90
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:41,245
Tell them all we know. There's a chance
if they launch an all-out offensive,

91
00:20:41,328 --> 00:20:43,683
-I might be able to stop the rocket.
-What are you going to do?

92
00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:46,441
-Try to sabotage it, or at least delay it. Off you go.
-Right.

93
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:49,326
-Good luck.
-Sevrin, you come with us.

They're coming up after us.
You must keep moving. You must.

98
01:01:29,368 --> 01:01:32,121
I can't. I can't move.

99
01:01:32,888 --> 01:01:34,526

We must go on, Sarah, it's our only chance.

103
01:02:37,848 --> 01:02:41,841
That section of the roof slides out.
We can get to it from the top of the rocket.

01:02:41,928 --> 01:02:44,806
-We've got to get across first.
-We'll have to jump.

105
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:48,917
Now I'll go first, you follow and I'll catch you.

106
01:02:59,808 --> 01:03:02,766
Come on, Sarah. Come on!

107
01:03:07,288 --> 01:03:09,677

Jump!

109
01:03:23,248 --> 01:03:25,478
We're nearly there, just a bit more

110
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:28,605
and we're out on the surface of the dome
and safe.

111
01:03:40,688 --> 01:03:42,724
-That's far enough.
-Right.

112
01:03:44,048 --> 01:03:46,039

Give me your hand, come on.

116

If I should just slacken my grip...

117
01:04:19,688 --> 01:04:23,886
They say people who fall from great heights
are dead before they hit the ground.

118

I don't believe that, do you?

You're going back to work.

We must look out for Sarah.
She's out there somewhere.

141
01:06:37,128 --> 01:06:40,484
We'll find her.
We've got to contact the Kaled leaders first.

Try again, they're pretty corroded.

150

Does Davros know the prisoners have escaped?

151
01:07:24,568 --> 01:07:27,366
I don't know what you mean.
The prisoners are in their cell.

152

Don't worry, I won't betray you.

153
01:07:29,648 --> 01:07:34,324
You're not the only one concerned
about the morality of the work we are doing here.

154
01:07:34,408 --> 01:07:37,206
Now answer me, does Davros know they've gone?

155
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:41,680
The prisoners are in the detention room
for further interrogation.

156
01:07:41,768 --> 01:07:43,440
Well, I have news for you.

157
01:07:43,528 --> 01:07:47,999
They've reached the city and made contact
with the leaders whose names you gave them.

158
01:07:49,608 --> 01:07:51,758
How do you know?

159
01:07:51,848 --> 01:07:55,761
There is some advantage
of being in charge of the communication system.

160
01:07:55,848 --> 01:07:57,486
All we can hope for now

161
01:07:57,568 --> 01:08:01,243
is that they convince the leaders
that Davros' work here must be ended.

162
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:03,683
They must, they must!

163
01:08:21,688 --> 01:08:23,326

and not in our House of Congress

01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:29,642
as our meeting is of a most secret nature.

166
01:08:30,288 --> 01:08:33,200
There are no listening devices here,
are there, Ravon?

167
01:08:33,288 --> 01:08:35,848
Not that I know of, Mogran.

168
01:08:35,928 --> 01:08:39,477
Doctor, will you please tell the councillors
what you have told me?

169
01:08:39,568 --> 01:08:43,880
Yes, of course. And some of what I will tell you
relates to events in the future.

170
01:08:44,568 --> 01:08:48,322
Not only on this planet but also on others
whose existence you don't even know of.

171
01:08:48,408 --> 01:08:51,605
But my knowledge is scientific fact.

172
01:08:51,688 --> 01:08:55,363
Now Davros has created a machine-creature,
a monster,

173
01:08:55,448 --> 01:08:57,404
which will terrorise and destroy

174
01:08:57,488 --> 01:09:01,117
millions and millions of lives
and lands throughout all eternity.

175
01:09:02,368 --> 01:09:05,166
He has given this machine a name, a Dalek.

176
01:09:05,968 --> 01:09:07,845
It is a word new to you.

177
01:09:07,928 --> 01:09:12,080
But for a thousand generations,
it is a name that will bring fear and terror.

178
01:09:12,488 --> 01:09:17,323
Now, undoubtedly, Davros has
one of the finest scientific minds in existence.

179
01:09:18,528 --> 01:09:22,203
But he has a fanatical desire
to perpetuate himself and his machine.

180
01:09:22,848 --> 01:09:26,158
He works without conscience,
without soul, without pity,

181
01:09:26,888 --> 01:09:30,164
and his machines are equally devoid
of these qualities.

182
01:09:54,968 --> 01:09:57,084
What's the matter with her?

183
01:09:57,168 --> 01:10:00,126
She's tired. She needs rest.

184
01:10:00,688 --> 01:10:02,565
This is the last consignment.

185
01:10:03,248 --> 01:10:07,605
When that's packed aboard, she'll get
all the rest she needs. Now pick up your loads.

186
01:13:23,728 --> 01:13:27,880
<i>The Kaled people sacrifice much</i>
<i>so that we should have the materials we need.</i>

187
01:13:27,968 --> 01:13:31,119
<i>They have the right to know</i>
<i>how our work is progressing.</i>

188
01:13:31,368 --> 01:13:34,007
<i>And when they learn of our achievements,</i>

189
01:13:34,088 --> 01:13:36,682
<i>their patriotism will be refired.</i>

190
01:13:37,168 --> 01:13:42,322
<i>It is vital that our soldiers know</i>
<i>that they and we of the Elite are as one,</i>

191
01:13:42,768 --> 01:13:46,397
<i>working together to bring the final victory.</i>

192
01:13:46,728 --> 01:13:51,119
I'm grateful that you've accepted this decision
so patriotically.

193
01:14:17,308 --> 01:14:21,062
-Thank you, Davros, for your cooperation.
<i>-It is simply my duty.</i>

194
01:14:21,148 --> 01:14:23,343
<i>The inquiry will reveal nothing,</i>

195
01:14:23,428 --> 01:14:28,343
<i>except our loyalty and total dedication</i>
<i>to the cause of the Kaled people.</i>

196
01:16:43,908 --> 01:16:46,422
What's Davros doing here in the Thal city?

197
01:16:49,988 --> 01:16:55,426
<i>And I am no longer influenced by words</i>
<i>such as patriotism and nationalism.</i>

198
01:16:55,948 --> 01:16:58,860
<i>My concern is only for peace,</i>
<i>an end to this carnage</i>

199
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:01,985
<i>that has virtually destroyed both our races.</i>

200
01:17:02,068 --> 01:17:04,628
Why aren't you telling this
to your own government and people?

201
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:06,903
<i>I have tried, time and again I have tried.</i>

202
01:17:06,988 --> 01:17:12,381
<i>But now they will be satisfied with nothing</i>
<i>other than total annihilation of the Thal people.</i>

203
01:17:12,468 --> 01:17:17,064
Then they deserve to perish,
and perish they will when we launch our rocket.

204
01:17:17,148 --> 01:17:18,900
It's primed and ready.

205
01:17:18,988 --> 01:17:22,867
-The countdown for firing can begin immediately.
<i>-And it will fail.</i>

206
01:17:23,268 --> 01:17:26,419
-It can't fail.
<i>-The Kaled dome cannot be penetrated.</i>

207
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:29,705
<i>Your great rocket will hardly scratch it.</i>

208
01:17:29,788 --> 01:17:31,540
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

209
01:17:44,948 --> 01:17:48,145
<i>This is the nature of my faith. Nyder.</i>

210
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:52,142
It is a simple chemical formula.

211
01:17:52,228 --> 01:17:54,788
If the substance is loaded into artillery shells

212
01:17:54,868 --> 01:17:58,224
and fired onto the surface of the Kaled dome,

213
01:17:58,308 --> 01:18:01,345
it will weaken the molecular structure
and make it brittle.

214
01:18:01,428 --> 01:18:05,307
Your rocket will then be able to penetrate
without resistance.

215
01:18:05,588 --> 01:18:07,863
Why are you giving us this information?

216
01:18:07,948 --> 01:18:12,305
You know that your own people,
the Kaleds, will be utterly exterminated.

217
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:15,141
<i>No price is too great to pay for peace.</i>

218
01:18:15,228 --> 01:18:17,264
<i>I only ask that when the war is over</i>

219
01:18:17,348 --> 01:18:20,340
<i>I be allowed to help</i>
<i>in the reconstruction of our planet.</i>

220
01:18:20,428 --> 01:18:23,545
We want only to see
the conflict brought to an end.

221
01:18:23,628 --> 01:18:26,779
This formula gives you the power
to bring that about.

222
01:18:27,388 --> 01:18:31,779
<i>By dawn tomorrow, our world could be at peace.</i>

223
01:19:52,688 --> 01:19:57,000
The rockets are loaded.
Why are they still keeping us here?

224
01:19:57,088 --> 01:20:00,763
Why take the trouble to move us?
It's easier to leave us here.

225
01:20:01,368 --> 01:20:05,759
Yes, but when it's fired,
the exhaust blast will burn us up...

226
01:20:50,848 --> 01:20:55,717
Well, don't just stand there, come on, you're free.
Go now while you've got the chance. Come on!
