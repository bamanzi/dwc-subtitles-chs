1
00:48:57,084 --> 00:48:58,642
What's taking him so long?

2
00:48:58,724 --> 00:49:03,195
It's a very difficult operation, Sarah.
Still, he should have finished by now.

3
00:49:03,284 --> 00:49:04,512
Doctor?

4
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:07,916
Doctor, are you all right?

5
00:49:11,404 --> 00:49:12,553
Sarah!

6
00:49:15,004 --> 00:49:16,642
Get it off!

7
00:49:18,044 --> 00:49:19,796
Get it off!

8
00:49:21,924 --> 00:49:23,323
Got it.

9
00:49:26,844 --> 00:49:28,038
Doctor!

10
00:49:32,244 --> 00:49:34,360
What are you waiting for?

11
00:49:34,444 --> 00:49:37,004
Just touch these two strands together

12
00:49:37,084 --> 00:49:39,200
and the Daleks are finished.

13
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:42,203
Have I that right?

14
00:49:42,284 --> 00:49:44,479
To destroy the Daleks? You can't doubt it.

15
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,680
Well, I do.

16
00:49:46,764 --> 00:49:49,676
You see, some things could be better
with the Daleks.

17
00:49:49,764 --> 00:49:53,757
Many future worlds will become allies
just because of their fear of the Daleks.

18
00:49:53,844 --> 00:49:55,323
But it isn't like that.

19
00:49:55,404 --> 00:49:58,874
But the final responsibility is mine,
and mine alone.

20
00:50:00,404 --> 00:50:03,760
Listen, if someone who knew the future

21
00:50:03,844 --> 00:50:06,438
pointed out a child to you
and told you that that child

22
00:50:06,524 --> 00:50:08,401
would grow up totally evil,

23
00:50:08,484 --> 00:50:11,840
to be a ruthless dictator
who would destroy millions of lives,

24
00:50:11,924 --> 00:50:14,199
could you then kill that child?

25
00:50:14,844 --> 00:50:18,359
We're talking about the Daleks.
The most evil creatures ever invented.

26
00:50:18,444 --> 00:50:22,039
You must destroy them. You must complete
your mission for the Time Lords.

27
00:50:22,124 --> 00:50:23,876
Do I have the right?

28
00:50:24,964 --> 00:50:28,639
Simply touch one wire against the other
and that's it.

29
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:30,794
The Daleks cease to exist.

30
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:32,836
Hundreds of millions of people,

31
00:50:32,924 --> 00:50:36,883
thousands of generations
can live without fear, in peace,

32
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,673
and never even know the word ''Dalek''.

33
00:50:39,764 --> 00:50:41,322
Then why wait?

34
00:50:41,404 --> 00:50:45,636
If it was a disease or some sort of bacteria
you were destroying, you wouldn't hesitate.

35
00:50:45,724 --> 00:50:49,637
But if I kill, wipe out a whole intelligent life form,

36
00:50:49,724 --> 00:50:51,840
then I become like them.

37
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:53,642
I'd be no better than the Daleks.

38
00:50:53,724 --> 00:50:56,522
SARAH: Think of all the suffering
there'll be if you don't do it.

39
00:50:56,604 --> 00:50:58,515
GHARMAN: Doctor!

40
00:50:58,604 --> 00:51:00,834
Doctor, I've been looking everywhere for you.

41
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:02,721
Davros has agreed to our terms.

42
00:51:02,804 --> 00:51:05,716
-He submitted?
-He did. But he asked only one thing.

43
00:51:05,804 --> 00:51:09,956
That he might be allowed to address
a meeting of all the Elite, scientific and military.

44
00:51:10,044 --> 00:51:11,523
He's going to put a case?

45
00:51:11,604 --> 00:51:14,164
Yes, but a vote will be taken.
It's a foregone conclusion.

46
00:51:14,244 --> 00:51:18,715
There will be a complete landslide
against any further development of the Daleks.

47
00:51:18,804 --> 00:51:20,476
We've won.

48
00:51:20,564 --> 00:51:22,759
I'm grateful to you, Gharman.

49
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:25,436
More grateful than I can tell you.

50
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:37,760
Everybody is here, Davros.

51
00:51:39,524 --> 00:51:42,482
<i>The issues are simple and clear cut.</i>

52
00:51:43,244 --> 00:51:46,793
<i>I have given my life's work</i>
<i>to the survival of our race.</i>

53
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,076
<i>The travel machine I designed,</i>

54
00:51:49,164 --> 00:51:53,442
<i>the Dalek, will give the creature</i>
<i>into which we will mutate</i>

55
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:56,322
<i>its only possibility of continued existence.</i>

56
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,235
But you have deviated from that intention.

57
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:01,396
You have introduced genetic changes
that will alter the mutation

58
00:52:01,484 --> 00:52:04,454
into a creature without morals and without ethics.

59
00:52:04,484 --> 00:52:08,716
<i>One race must survive all others.</i>
<i>And to do this, it must dominate.</i>

60
00:52:09,124 --> 00:52:10,716
<i>Ruthlessly.</i>

61
00:52:11,244 --> 00:52:15,476
<i>Now I intend that</i>
<i>when all the bickering and battling is over,</i>

62
00:52:15,564 --> 00:52:18,032
<i>the supreme victor shall be our race,</i>

63
00:52:18,124 --> 00:52:19,523
<i>the Daleks.</i>

64
00:52:20,244 --> 00:52:22,155
<i>At this very moment,</i>

65
00:52:22,244 --> 00:52:26,635
<i>the production lines stand ready,</i>
<i>totally automated, fully programmed.</i>

66
00:52:27,604 --> 00:52:29,913
<i>The Daleks are no longer dependent on us.</i>

67
00:52:30,004 --> 00:52:33,758
<i>The machinery is ready.</i>
<i>They are a power in their own right.</i>

68
00:52:35,164 --> 00:52:39,157
<i>If any one of you would destroy</i>
<i>everything that we have ever achieved,</i>

69
00:52:39,244 --> 00:52:40,882
<i>then here...</i>

70
00:52:43,044 --> 00:52:44,841
<i>is a destruct button.</i>

71
00:52:45,804 --> 00:52:49,922
<i>Press it and you will destroy this bunker</i>
<i>and everything in it.</i>

72
00:52:50,364 --> 00:52:52,434
<i>Only this room will remain.</i>

73
00:52:53,484 --> 00:52:57,841
<i>Press it and you will wipe out our entire race,</i>
<i>destroy the Daleks forever.</i>

74
00:52:58,764 --> 00:53:01,119
<i>Which of you will do it?</i>

75
00:53:05,004 --> 00:53:07,313
<i>You are men without courage.</i>

76
00:53:08,404 --> 00:53:11,077
<i>You have lost your right to survive.</i>

77
00:53:16,104 --> 00:53:18,174
You have heard Davros' case.

78
00:53:18,264 --> 00:53:20,414
What he has not made clear
is that there is another way.

79
00:53:20,504 --> 00:53:22,017
<i>There is no other way.</i>

80
00:53:22,104 --> 00:53:23,981
Production of the Dalek can continue.

81
00:53:24,064 --> 00:53:26,373
We can destroy
the genetically conditioned creatures

82
00:53:26,464 --> 00:53:28,932
and allow the mutation to follow its own course.

83
00:53:29,024 --> 00:53:32,983
Our race will survive if it deserves to survive.

84
00:53:33,424 --> 00:53:36,734
But let it have all the strengths
and weaknesses that we have,

85
00:53:36,824 --> 00:53:38,337
compassion and hate.

86
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,858
Let it do good things and evil.

87
00:53:40,944 --> 00:53:44,823
But we cannot let it become
an unfeeling, heartless machine.

88
00:53:45,104 --> 00:53:47,743
That is our choice. Now...

89
00:53:49,344 --> 00:53:50,777
we must decide.

90
00:53:52,424 --> 00:53:55,621
-We've got to find that time ring.
-SARAH: Doctor.

91
00:53:58,584 --> 00:54:00,381
Good girl, Sarah.

92
00:54:00,464 --> 00:54:03,536
Now all we need is the tape recorder.
So keep an eye on Nyder.

93
00:54:03,624 --> 00:54:06,184
<i>You've heard our cases.</i>

94
00:54:06,264 --> 00:54:08,380
<i>I will give you two minutes to decide.</i>

95
00:54:08,464 --> 00:54:11,262
<i>Then you must answer not only to me,</i>
<i>but to the future.</i>

96
00:54:15,744 --> 00:54:20,735
(HUSHED WHISPERING)

97
00:54:25,784 --> 00:54:28,139
<i>You've had ample time to decide.</i>

98
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:31,853
<i>Those who would remain loyal to me</i>
<i>and to the future of our race,</i>

99
00:54:31,944 --> 00:54:34,458
<i>move forward and stand at my side.</i>

100
00:54:46,624 --> 00:54:49,855
Now, I wonder where Nyder is going
at such a crucial moment.

101
00:54:49,944 --> 00:54:52,617
-I think we ought to find out.
-So do I.

102
00:54:53,304 --> 00:54:54,703
Let's go.

103
00:55:26,864 --> 00:55:29,173
Right, bring out the explosives.

104
00:55:29,624 --> 00:55:33,173
Now, lay the charges
on each of these main carriers.

105
00:55:33,264 --> 00:55:36,256
One charge for each beam should be enough.

106
00:55:43,184 --> 00:55:45,015
Now, where are you going in such a hurry?

107
00:55:45,104 --> 00:55:48,096
Davros is lost. I am getting away while I can.

108
00:55:48,184 --> 00:55:49,458
Oh.

109
00:55:49,544 --> 00:55:51,500
Somehow that just doesn't ring true.

110
00:55:51,584 --> 00:55:54,144
Why didn't you just join the other side?

111
00:55:54,224 --> 00:55:57,899
Now, that's a good question.
Do you have a good answer?

112
00:55:57,984 --> 00:55:59,576
Evidently not.

113
00:55:59,664 --> 00:56:04,101
Well, then let's try something else.
That tape recorder you took. Where is it?

114
00:56:04,184 --> 00:56:07,460
It's put away in a safe in Davros' office.

115
00:56:08,544 --> 00:56:11,820
-Shall we go and see?
-Down here.

116
00:56:18,344 --> 00:56:20,938
Are you quite sure
this is the only way into the bunker?

117
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:23,663
Well, the only other way was from the Kaled dome

118
00:56:23,744 --> 00:56:26,975
and your war rocket caved that in.
It can never be cleared.

119
00:56:27,064 --> 00:56:30,852
If we do the same here, we'll entomb
the Daleks and those who created them.

120
00:56:30,944 --> 00:56:35,142
But Sarah and the Doctor are inside.
You'll give them a chance to get clear, won't you?

121
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:38,216
I must blow the roof
as soon as the charges are laid. I can't delay.

122
00:56:38,304 --> 00:56:40,534
If the Daleks find out
what we are doing and attack,

123
00:56:40,624 --> 00:56:43,502
I don't have enough men or arms
to stand them off.

124
00:56:43,584 --> 00:56:46,462
-How long?
-Thirty minutes, perhaps less.

125
00:56:46,544 --> 00:56:50,742
-Then I must get inside and try and warn them.
-That's up to you.

126
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,577
But you must understand,
if you're not back, I must go on.

127
00:56:50,944 --> 00:56:52,013
Ah!

128
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:56,974
-You'll die in there with them.
-I understand.

129
00:56:57,064 --> 00:56:58,975
I'll give you what time I can.

130
00:56:59,424 --> 00:57:00,618
Right.

131
00:57:10,184 --> 00:57:11,742
Thank you.

132
00:57:11,824 --> 00:57:13,701
Now, let's destroy it.

133
00:57:18,744 --> 00:57:21,463
-How about this?
-How very apt.

134
00:57:21,944 --> 00:57:23,616
A Dalek gun.

135
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:28,293
There.

136
00:57:35,864 --> 00:57:37,422
He's not important.

137
00:57:37,504 --> 00:57:41,338
We've got the time ring, we've destroyed the tape
and Davros' power is broken.

138
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,574
What about the Daleks
that are already operational?

139
00:57:43,664 --> 00:57:47,703
Oh, I think we can leave Gharman to destroy them.

140
00:58:10,844 --> 00:58:13,517
-Why is it going on so long?
-Who knows?

141
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:17,599
It's out of character for Davros
to submit quite so easily.

142
00:58:18,124 --> 00:58:21,355
<i>This is your last chance. Move to join me now.</i>

143
00:58:21,444 --> 00:58:23,321
<i>Or suffer the consequences.</i>

144
00:58:23,404 --> 00:58:27,033
Why don't you just accept the fact
that you have lost? It's over for you, Davros.

145
00:58:27,124 --> 00:58:30,434
<i>Do you believe that I would let a lifetime's work</i>

146
00:58:30,524 --> 00:58:33,675
<i>be ended by the will of spineless fools like you?</i>

147
00:58:33,884 --> 00:58:35,602
<i>You have won nothing.</i>

148
00:58:35,684 --> 00:58:39,438
<i>I allowed this charade to be played out</i>
<i>for one reason only.</i>

149
00:58:39,644 --> 00:58:42,636
<i>To find those men who were truly loyal to me</i>

150
00:58:42,724 --> 00:58:45,955
<i>and to discover those who would betray me!</i>

151
00:58:46,404 --> 00:58:47,439
<i>We...</i>

152
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,958
<i>I will go on!</i>

153
00:58:50,044 --> 00:58:52,797
You are insane, Davros.

154
00:59:06,044 --> 00:59:07,796
<i>Exterminate!</i>

155
00:59:08,204 --> 00:59:10,195
<i>Exterminate!</i>

156
00:59:10,604 --> 00:59:12,674
<i>Exterminate!</i>

157
00:59:19,484 --> 00:59:22,601
Stop them, Davros. You must stop them.

158
00:59:38,024 --> 00:59:40,982
-That's the last one in position.
-Right. Prepare to detonate.

159
01:00:00,624 --> 01:00:03,377
<i>The automated Dalek production line</i>
<i>has been started.</i>

160
01:00:03,464 --> 01:00:06,103
<i>I gave no such order. Who did?</i>

161
01:00:06,184 --> 01:00:08,140
DALEK: <i>I gave the command.</i>

162
01:00:08,744 --> 01:00:11,941
<i>You will perform no function</i>
<i>unless ordered by me.</i>

163
01:00:14,504 --> 01:00:16,620
<i>You will obey only my commands.</i>

164
01:00:16,704 --> 01:00:19,343
<i>The production line is to be halted immediately.</i>

165
01:00:20,904 --> 01:00:23,464
<i>You heard my order. Obey!</i>

166
01:00:25,464 --> 01:00:26,817
<i>Obey!</i>

167
01:00:28,104 --> 01:00:31,574
<i>I created you! I am the master, not you!</i>

168
01:00:31,664 --> 01:00:34,303
<i>I. I. I!</i>

169
01:00:38,964 --> 01:00:40,920
<i>-Nyder.</i>
-Yes, Davros.

170
01:00:45,324 --> 00:19:47,758
<i>Production will continue.</i>

171
01:00:49,544 --> 01:00:52,342
DALEK: <i>Our programming does not permit us</i>

172
01:00:52,424 --> 01:00:57,339
<i>to acknowledge that any creature</i>
<i>is superior to the Daleks.</i>

173
01:00:57,424 --> 01:00:59,654
<i>You cannot exist without me.</i>

174
01:00:59,384 --> 01:01:01,181
<i>All inferior creatures</i>

175
01:01:01,264 --> 01:01:05,974
<i>are to be considered the enemy of the Daleks</i>
<i>and destroyed.</i>

176
01:01:06,064 --> 01:01:06,580
<i>No, wait!</i>

177
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:08,655
<i>Exterminate!</i>

178
01:01:11,544 --> 01:01:15,139
<i>For the last time, I am your creator!</i>

179
01:01:15,504 --> 01:01:19,383
<i>You must, you will obey me!</i>

180
01:01:19,544 --> 01:01:21,853
<i>We obey no one.</i>

181
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:25,141
<i>We are the superior beings.</i>

182
01:01:25,744 --> 01:01:27,780
<i>Exterminate!</i>

186
01:01:48,784 --> 01:01:52,015
<i>We are entombed, but we live on.</i>

187
01:01:52,664 --> 01:01:55,462
<i>This is only the beginning.</i>

188
01:01:55,544 --> 01:01:59,901
<i>We will prepare. We will grow stronger.</i>

189
01:02:00,344 --> 01:02:03,814
<i>When the time is right, we will emerge</i>

190
01:02:03,904 --> 01:02:06,213
<i>and take our rightful place</i>

191
01:02:06,304 --> 01:02:08,613

01:02:08,704 --> 01:02:11,616

DOCTOR: <i>You see, I know</i>

195
01:02:33,264 --> 01:02:37,621
<i>that although the Daleks will create</i>

196
01:02:38,264 --> 01:02:40,903
<i>I know also that out of their evil</i>
