00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:08,161
<i>The humanoids</i>
<i>must first be destroyed.</i>

2
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:13,437
<i>You will re-enter cells</i>
<i>to conserve energy.</i>

3
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:11,006
Keep back!

4
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:13,126
Your gun.

5
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:19,598
You've killed him, you murderer.

6
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:22,235
No. He is fortunate. I spared him.

7
00:41:22,407 --> 00:41:25,479
- You missed him.
- Silence! I could have killed him.

8
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,525
- Shall I kill them now?
- No, that will not be necessary.

9
00:41:28,607 --> 00:41:30,598
The Cybermen
will have a use for them.

10
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:34,964
You will make excellent
experimental specimens.

11
00:41:35,127 --> 00:41:37,436
Oh, let me help him, please!

12
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:39,406
No tricks.

13
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:41,876
Still think you can bargain
with the Cybermen?

14
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:44,117
Certainly. This time on our terms.

15
00:41:52,247 --> 00:41:54,681
I wish to speak to the Controller.

16
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:58,965
I wish to speak to the Controller!

17
00:42:05,807 --> 00:42:08,765
<i>He is now prepared.</i>

18
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:11,603
<i>Release him.</i>

19
00:42:21,347 --> 00:42:22,826
They're coming.

20
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:27,423
Now, gentlemen, you will see how
I shall use the power of the Cybermen.

21
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:30,499
Use, maybe, but you'll never
control the Cybermen.

22
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:32,544
- Behind you.
- Stop!

23
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:35,262
You know what this can do to you.

24
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:41,706
Toberman, it is good
that you are back.

25
00:42:42,467 --> 00:42:43,786
Watch them.

26
00:42:47,387 --> 00:42:50,584
- Doctor, he seems er...
- Yes, Jamie, yes.

27
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:52,978
I shall let you be revitalised.

28
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:54,944
To survive, it must be now.

29
00:42:59,067 --> 00:43:01,376
Come forward. Slowly.

30
00:43:01,467 --> 00:43:03,105
- Be careful.
- Leave this to me.

31
00:43:14,607 --> 00:43:17,326
You are absolutely crazy
to trust them!

32
00:43:17,407 --> 00:43:18,726
You think so?

33
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:22,925
Then perhaps you and your colleagues
had better join him. Go on. Go on!

34
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:26,923
- The girl stays with us.
- No!

35
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:28,406
She is our hostage.

36
00:43:32,927 --> 00:43:34,519
Close the hatch.

37
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:38,518
You seem to be in trouble.

38
00:43:39,847 --> 00:43:42,361
<i>The energy...</i>

39
00:43:42,447 --> 00:43:45,280
<i>levels...are...low.</i>

<i>We...will...survive.</i>

41
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:53,082
<i>You will help us.</i>

42
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:56,882
<i>You will...help...us...</i>

43
00:43:57,047 --> 00:43:58,719
Yes. Yes, certainly.

44
00:43:58,807 --> 00:44:02,322
- Jamie, Professor.
- You're not going to help them?

45
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:04,602
You can't support these creatures!

46
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:06,564
I think it best. Come on.

47
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,046
Come along.

48
00:44:08,127 --> 00:44:09,446
That's it.

49
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:19,400
<i>Do...you...understand...</i>
<i>the...machine?</i>

50
00:44:19,487 --> 00:44:21,000
Yes. One moment.

51
00:44:21,087 --> 00:44:24,284
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Let's help Victoria.

52
00:44:24,367 --> 00:44:26,039
In a moment, Jamie.

53
00:44:27,407 --> 00:44:29,204
(DOCTOR) Are you ready?

54
00:44:38,607 --> 00:44:41,804
<i>We will survive.</i>

55
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,878
<i>We will sur...</i>

56
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:47,517
Now, where would you rather
have him - in or out of there?

57
00:44:47,907 --> 00:44:50,501
Oh, I see what you mean.

58
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:53,545
Only we must make sure
that he stays in there.

59
00:44:55,887 --> 00:44:59,482
Do you really believe you can bargain
with those terrible Cybermen?

60
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:02,127
That is our concern, not yours.

61
00:45:02,207 --> 00:45:04,084
I'm talking to him, not you.

62
00:45:04,147 --> 00:45:06,622
They will have to agree to our plan.

63
00:45:07,807 --> 00:45:09,559
We shouldn't have touched it.

64
00:45:09,647 --> 00:45:11,763
Turn it off. It's out of control.

65
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:15,196
(NOISE DIES DOWN)

66
00:45:20,887 --> 00:45:22,400
It's taken over.

67
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:23,806
I think not.

68
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,436
There must be some sort
of internal timing mechanism.

69
00:45:27,527 --> 00:45:30,439
Jamie, I hope you made
those ropes secure.

70
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,405
The King of Beasties
couldnae get out of that.

71
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:45,235
Jamie, remind me to give you
a lesson in tying knots.

72
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:47,318
What do you hope to gain from this?

73
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:50,365
- That does not concern you.
- They might as well know.

74
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:53,245
We are going to build
a better world.

75
00:45:53,327 --> 00:45:55,238
(CALLUM) Better? But who for?

76
00:45:56,927 --> 00:45:58,883
I told you to watch the door.

77
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,400
Aagh!

78
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:01,886
Aagh!

79
00:46:03,287 --> 00:46:04,606
Toberman.

80
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,886
Victoria.

81
00:46:12,527 --> 00:46:15,837
- <i>You have done well.</i>
- Toberman!

82
00:46:15,927 --> 00:46:17,360
<i>Silence.</i>

83
00:46:17,447 --> 00:46:21,281
<i>He is now under our control.</i>

84
00:46:21,367 --> 00:46:23,881
<i>Open the tombs.</i>

85
00:46:23,967 --> 00:46:25,286
No.

86
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:29,798
You have broken your promise.

87
00:46:29,967 --> 00:46:33,039
<i>Cybermen do not promise.</i>

88
00:46:33,567 --> 00:46:36,798
<i>Such ideas have no value.</i>

89
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:38,686
<i>Open.</i>

90
00:46:39,807 --> 00:46:41,126
No.

91
00:47:01,447 --> 00:47:03,961
<i>That gun will not harm me.</i>

92
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:08,846
Aagh!

93
00:47:18,327 --> 00:47:20,124
Look what they've done.

94
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:23,677
You are not like them. You're a man
like us. You must help us.

95
00:47:24,807 --> 00:47:27,605
He has killed Kaftan.
You must help us.

96
00:47:28,927 --> 00:47:32,886
<i>You will report to the surface.</i>

Jamie, the hatch!

99
00:48:10,527 --> 00:48:11,926
The gun, Jamie!

100
00:48:31,527 --> 00:48:33,199
There's another one!

101
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:37,476
(CRASHING)

102
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:40,080
Are there any more?

103
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,158
No. I'll close the hatch.

104
00:48:42,247 --> 00:48:44,807
Wait a minute.
We'd better go down there.

105
00:48:44,887 --> 00:48:47,355
- Not again!
- It's the only way to make sure.

106
00:48:47,447 --> 00:48:50,325
- I'll go too.
- No. Stay and look after Victoria.

107
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,804
I'll take somebody else.

108
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,559
Toberman.

109
00:48:58,647 --> 00:49:01,320
You see what these creatures
have done to you?

110
00:49:01,407 --> 00:49:05,685
They've tried to make you like them.
Do you understand?

111
00:49:06,327 --> 00:49:09,603
They've tried to make you
their slave. They want to use you.

112
00:49:09,687 --> 00:49:13,282
They are evil. Think of Kaftan.

113
00:49:13,447 --> 00:49:16,644
- Evil!
- They must be destroyed, you see.

114
00:49:16,727 --> 00:49:18,638
Evil must be destroyed.

115
00:49:18,727 --> 00:49:20,319
Now, come.

116
00:49:20,407 --> 00:49:21,726
Destroyed!

117
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:24,120
Come on.

118
00:49:25,207 --> 00:49:26,526
Come on!

119
00:49:35,287 --> 00:49:36,879
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

120
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:39,276
- Doctor, the gun.
- I shan't need that.

121
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:41,879
Should have taken it.

122
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:44,800
- Aagh!
- Poor Mr Callum. How are you?

123
00:49:44,887 --> 00:49:46,639
I can't move my arm.

124
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:01,639
Move quietly.

125
00:50:01,727 --> 00:50:03,558
They're all dormant, see?

126
00:50:09,247 --> 00:50:10,566
Evil!

127
00:50:10,727 --> 00:50:14,242
No! Quietly. They're only asleep.

128
00:50:14,327 --> 00:50:18,161
They're not frozen yet.
You watch them. I have things to do.

129
00:50:19,087 --> 00:50:20,679
Now, let me see.

130
00:50:21,407 --> 00:50:22,726
Yes.

131
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:27,242
The cryostat! You're freezing them!

132
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:29,046
Klieg!

133
00:50:34,087 --> 00:50:36,203
No! You'll wake them up!

134
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:38,323
That is exactly my intention.

135
00:50:38,407 --> 00:50:40,682
You still don't understand, do you?

136
00:50:40,847 --> 00:50:42,644
Their Controller is dead.

137
00:50:42,727 --> 00:50:46,356
Now I shall control them.
They will do what I say.

138
00:50:46,927 --> 00:50:48,246
You see, Doctor.

139
00:50:48,407 --> 00:50:51,763
Yours is the privilege
to witness for the first time

140
00:50:51,847 --> 00:50:56,045
the union between mass power
and my absolute intelligence.

141
00:50:57,807 --> 00:50:59,365
Who is that?

142
00:51:00,487 --> 00:51:01,886
Come out.

143
00:51:04,287 --> 00:51:06,596
Come out or I shall kill this man!

144
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,366
Oh, it's you.

145
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:14,562
Go to that wall, all of you.

146
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,846
All of you!

147
00:51:24,887 --> 00:51:26,206
No.

148
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:30,966
I have a better idea,
a much better idea.

149
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:33,561
I shall leave you to the Cybermen.

150
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:36,682
I'm sure
they'll have some use for you.

151
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:38,885
Or parts of you!

152
00:51:45,407 --> 00:51:47,284
(KLIEG SCREAMS)

153
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:05,085
Quick, Jamie!
These two levers together.

154
00:52:05,847 --> 00:52:08,964
- I can't shift this one.
- What? Trip that first.

155
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,397
Last time they were frozen
for five centuries.

156
00:53:01,207 --> 00:53:03,084
This time it must be forever.

157
00:53:29,487 --> 00:53:31,159
Oh, Doctor!

158
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:34,444
Here we are, Victoria,
safe and sound. Close the hatch.

159
00:53:42,727 --> 00:53:44,206
There we are.

160
00:53:46,247 --> 00:53:47,646
Now then.

161
00:53:50,407 --> 00:53:54,036
The best thing about a machine
that makes sense -

162
00:53:54,807 --> 00:53:58,243
you can very easily
make it turn out nonsense.

163
00:54:00,287 --> 00:54:03,643
- I think you'd better go outside.
- What are you going to do?

164
00:54:03,727 --> 00:54:06,195
I'm going
to re-electrify the main doors.

165
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:10,121
Only this time I'm going to include
the hatch and the control panel.

166
00:54:10,207 --> 00:54:13,438
Anyone touching any of them
will get a considerable shock.

167
00:54:13,527 --> 00:54:16,166
A fatal one. Now, everyone outside.

168
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:20,716
Please take him with you.
I shall be glad to see him outside.

169
00:54:24,557 --> 00:54:26,787
There we are. That's done.

170
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:31,510
We just have to close the main doors
and the circuit is complete.

171
00:54:31,597 --> 00:54:33,508
Thank goodness for that.

172
00:54:36,197 --> 00:54:37,516
Doctor.

173
00:54:37,757 --> 00:54:39,110
Doctor!

174
00:54:41,917 --> 00:54:43,270
Jamie...

175
00:54:44,237 --> 00:54:46,592
You go that way. I'll go this way.

176
00:54:47,037 --> 00:54:49,073
That gives us more of a chance.

177
00:54:49,157 --> 00:54:51,796
When I say run, run.

178
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:01,396
Run!

179
00:55:04,237 --> 00:55:05,590
Quickly!

180
00:55:09,117 --> 00:55:11,392
Stop! We'll get a shock.

181
00:55:12,077 --> 00:55:15,308
We must find something to insulate.
That shoring timber.

182
00:55:15,997 --> 00:55:17,350
Hurry up!

183
00:55:17,437 --> 00:55:19,997
Hurry up, he's coming!

184
00:55:22,237 --> 00:55:24,705
We must keep him inside

185
00:55:24,797 --> 00:55:26,913
or all our work will be wasted.

186
00:55:26,997 --> 00:55:30,034
- I can't hold mine!
- You must!

187
00:55:30,117 --> 00:55:31,630
Toberman!

188
00:55:36,277 --> 00:55:38,586
<i>We must survive.</i>

189
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,789
<i>We must survive.</i>

190
00:55:41,957 --> 00:55:43,276
You are evil.

191
00:55:43,437 --> 00:55:45,951
- Toberman, come away!
- You'll get killed, man!

192
00:55:46,117 --> 00:55:48,711
They shall never pass Toberman.

193
00:55:50,197 --> 00:55:51,915
The door is closed.

194
01:06:09,557 --> 01:06:12,549
How terrible. Another life gone.

195
01:06:12,637 --> 01:06:14,787
(HOPPER) Come on, Professor.

196
01:06:14,877 --> 01:06:16,595
Blast-off in nine minutes.

197
01:06:20,037 --> 01:06:22,267
Anybody coming along for the ride?

198
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:24,951
We have our own flying machine.

199
01:06:25,037 --> 01:06:26,868
Flying machine?

200
01:06:26,957 --> 01:06:28,754
At least it works.

201
01:06:28,837 --> 01:06:30,634
Aw, let's go.

202
01:06:30,717 --> 01:06:32,469
Right. Well...

203
01:06:34,117 --> 01:06:35,914
- Goodbye, Doctor.
- Goodbye.

204
01:06:35,997 --> 01:06:38,431
- I'm sorry it had to end...
- I know.

205
01:06:38,597 --> 01:06:40,155
I know.

206
01:06:44,357 --> 01:06:45,756
Goodbye.

207
01:06:45,837 --> 01:06:48,715
That really is the end
of the Cybermen, isn't it?

208
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:50,116
Yes, Jamie.

209
01:06:51,037 --> 01:06:55,394
On the other hand...
I never like to make predictions.

210
01:06:55,557 --> 01:06:56,910
Come along.

211
01:47:26,597 --> 01:47:28,076
That's better.

212
01:47:29,877 --> 01:47:31,947
Now you are under my control.

213
01:47:33,077 --> 01:47:35,352
We know you must be revitalised

214
01:47:35,437 --> 01:47:37,428
or you will perish.

215
01:47:38,197 --> 01:47:40,108
If you agree to my terms...

216
01:47:41,197 --> 01:47:43,665
I shall let you survive.

217
01:47:44,797 --> 01:47:47,789
<i>I will listen.</i>

218
01:47:49,437 --> 01:47:51,348
Make them release Toberman.

219
01:47:51,437 --> 01:47:53,871
You're dafter than I thought.

220
01:47:53,957 --> 01:47:55,754
Silence! Sit down.

221
01:47:56,437 --> 01:47:59,076
First you release our man.

222
01:48:29,357 --> 01:48:30,836
Stay where you are!

223
01:48:31,477 --> 01:48:32,796
Now...

224
01:48:34,597 --> 01:48:36,792
Do you agree to accept our plan?

225
01:48:36,877 --> 01:48:38,868
- Plan?
- The conquest of the Earth.

226
01:48:39,037 --> 01:48:41,232
- What?! You must be...
- Silence!

227
01:48:41,717 --> 01:48:43,036
Your answer.

228
01:48:44,197 --> 01:48:47,030
<i>We accept.</i>

229
01:48:47,557 --> 01:48:55,510
<i>We will give you</i>
<i>some of our power devices.</i>

230
01:48:55,677 --> 01:48:59,147
Good. I knew an understanding
could be reached.

231
01:49:49,317 --> 01:49:51,512
Go on. Close it!

232
01:50:01,037 --> 01:50:03,471
- He's too weak to get in.
- Quiet, Jamie.

233
01:51:46,357 --> 01:51:48,234
What about the other weapon?

234
01:51:48,837 --> 01:51:50,589
What other weapon?

235
01:51:50,757 --> 01:51:53,430
I saw another one like that
in that room.

236
01:51:54,117 --> 01:51:55,436
Is that true?

237
01:51:55,517 --> 01:51:57,667
I don't know. We'd better make sure.

238
01:51:59,277 --> 01:52:00,676
No. Wait.

239
01:52:02,397 --> 01:52:05,867
That means that any one of them
in there could...

240
01:52:05,957 --> 01:52:08,152
Yes, you're right, Eric.

241
01:52:08,237 --> 01:52:09,716
Better wait here.

242
01:52:09,797 --> 01:52:12,914
If the Cyberman is aroused,
we shall be ready for him.

243
01:52:12,997 --> 01:52:14,828
Stay well clear.

244
01:52:14,997 --> 01:52:16,669
Take no chances.

245
01:52:25,477 --> 01:52:27,035
(WHIRRING)

246
01:52:27,117 --> 01:52:29,312
Keep back! It's smoking.

247
01:53:17,477 --> 01:53:20,753
<i>You will remain still.</i>

248
01:53:32,637 --> 01:53:34,912
Stay here and watch that door.

249
01:53:34,997 --> 01:53:36,908
At least we shall have some warning.

250
02:01:06,877 --> 02:01:09,596
- Now...
- Yes. As you say,

251
02:01:09,677 --> 02:01:14,068
such a combination
between intelligence and power

252
02:01:14,157 --> 02:01:16,193
would make you formidable indeed.

253
02:01:16,277 --> 02:01:20,031
Why, you would be Commander
of the Universe with your brilliance.

254
02:01:20,117 --> 02:01:22,950
The imagination reels
with the possibilities.

255
02:01:23,917 --> 02:01:27,307
Why, Doctor, if I'd only known
you shared my imagination,

256
02:01:27,397 --> 02:01:29,433
you might even have worked for me.

257
02:01:29,597 --> 02:01:31,508
Perhaps it's not too late.

258
02:01:31,597 --> 02:01:33,713
- Doctor!
- No, Jamie. Don't you see?

259
02:01:33,877 --> 02:01:37,995
Don't you see what this will mean
to all the people who serve Klieg -

260
02:01:38,157 --> 02:01:40,148
the all-powerful?

261
02:01:40,237 --> 02:01:43,752
No country, no person
would dare to have a single thought

262
02:01:43,837 --> 02:01:45,509
that was not your own -

263
02:01:45,597 --> 02:01:49,795
Eric Klieg's own conception
of the way of life!

264
02:01:49,957 --> 02:01:51,436
Brilliant!

265
02:01:51,517 --> 02:01:52,996
Yes.

266
02:01:53,717 --> 02:01:55,116
Yes, you're right.

267
02:01:55,197 --> 02:01:57,188
Master of the world.

268
02:01:58,597 --> 02:02:01,475
Now I know you're mad.
I just wanted to make sure.

269
02:02:04,237 --> 02:02:06,432
Well, we can blast off any time.

270
02:02:07,477 --> 02:02:09,229
- Sh!
- All right.

271
02:02:09,317 --> 02:02:11,990
Hey, what gives? Where is everybody?

272
02:02:12,077 --> 02:02:15,387
Down there.
And so are Klieg and the Cybermen.

273
02:02:15,477 --> 02:02:17,832
Well, I hope
they know what they're doing.

274
02:02:17,917 --> 02:02:20,989
I've been down there once
and I don't reckon to go again.

275
02:02:21,077 --> 02:02:22,829
That's all right, Captain.

276
02:02:22,917 --> 02:02:26,956
It's comforting to know we have
your superior strength to call on

277
02:02:27,037 --> 02:02:28,709
should we need it (!)

278
02:02:29,597 --> 02:02:32,987
And so you have forfeited
your right to survival.

279
02:02:33,077 --> 02:02:37,070
I shall make an example of you
to all who question my intelligence

280
02:02:37,157 --> 02:02:40,433
and the supreme power
of the Cybermen.

281
02:02:40,517 --> 02:02:43,190
You know, I've heard this
all before somewhere.

282
02:02:43,277 --> 02:02:44,790
You talk too much.

283
02:02:46,077 --> 02:02:47,635
You're stupid.

284
02:02:47,717 --> 02:02:52,268
You still think your puny minds
can survive against us?

285
02:02:52,357 --> 02:02:55,394
You are decadent. Weak!

286
02:02:55,477 --> 02:02:57,513
Do you know that? Weak!

287
02:02:58,557 --> 02:02:59,956
All right.

288
02:03:00,037 --> 02:03:01,709
Go ahead. Kill us.

289
02:04:24,557 --> 02:04:25,956
Jamie?

290
02:04:26,037 --> 02:04:27,993
I'll stay with the Doctor.

291
02:04:28,077 --> 02:04:29,749
Oh, all right.
