- Careful, Doctor!  - It's all right. I...

3
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:53,819
I think it's all right now.
我觉得现在没事了

4
00:14:55,067 --> 00:15:00,300
Yes. You see. It's just a mock-up, a model.
是的，你看。这只是一个样机，一个模型

5
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:03,140
Don't touch that!
That gun may be wired up too.
别碰那个！那把枪可能还没断开

6
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:04,722
- It's a trap.  - No, I don't think so.
- 这是个陷阱  - 不，我不觉得

7
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:07,303
It's a testing room for weapons.
这是一间武器测试室

8
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:09,557
This is a purely robotic Cyberman.
这纯粹只是个机械赛博人

9
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:12,081
There's no human material in it at all.
里面没有任何人类材料

10
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,886
It's a target for weapons.
它是武器的靶子

11
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:18,198
Let's get back to the control room
with this poor fellow.
我们回到控制室吧，带上这个可怜的家伙

12
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,359
What's that?
那是什么？

13
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:23,563
(JAMIE) Some wee creature
I found on the floor.
我在地板上找到的小怪物

14
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:26,999
It's a fossil.

15
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:29,362
Victoria, be careful! Let me see that.
Victoria, 小心！让我看看

16
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:35,676
Yes, it's certainly inactive,
but it's not a fossil.
是的，它的确是不活跃了，但并不是个化石

17
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:37,959

It's a Cybermat.
这是个赛博鼠

00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,004
What's a Cybermat?
赛博鼠是什么？

22
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:52,284
It's one of those...
I'd leave it alone if I were you.
它是一种...反正如果我是你就不会去碰它

23
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:57,642
I just don't understand this code.
我死活搞不明白这段编码

24
00:15:57,727 --> 00:15:59,638
The sequence doesn't make complete sense.
这个序列完全没有意义

25
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:01,922
You, a logician, can't understand it?
你，一个逻辑学家，搞不明白它？

26
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:04,396
- You must.
- But in the time we have...

27
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:07,365
We have plenty of time. You will see.

28
00:16:07,527 --> 00:16:10,758
- Lay him down there.
- What has happened to him?
- 把他在这里放下吧  - 他怎么了？

29
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:13,486
There's been a terrible accident. 
He's been shot.
发生了一次可怕的意外，他被枪击了

Would you all sit down for a moment?
好，看起来我们都到了。你们都坐下来歇一会儿吗？

31
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:18,766
Toberman?
Toberman?﻿

32
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:24,005
Mr Klieg?
Klieg 先生？

33
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,476
Leave me alone. Can't you see I'm working?
别烦我，你没看见我正在工作吗？

34
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:29,320
Have you forgotten
the purpose of this expedition?
你已经忘记这次探险的目的了？

35
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:33,275
This directly concerns my expedition.
You will kindly take your place.

Right. I'll come straight to the point.

37
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:49,480
I have reluctantly decided to abandon
the expedition and return to Earth.
我很不情愿地决定，放弃这次探险，回地球去

38
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:52,719
- It's impossible!
- I feel just as strongly about it as you.
- 这不可能！  - 我对此也有与你们一样强烈的感觉

39
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,118
This expedition has been
my dream for many years.
这次探险是我多年的梦想

40
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:59,802
There were some, like Mr Viner,
said more preparation was needed -
曾经有些人，比如 Viner 先生，说过需要做更多准备

41
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:01,366
more men and equipment.

42
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:06,282
I refused to heed their warnings,
and the result is that two have died.
我没有重视这些警告，结果是有两个人死掉了

43
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:10,076
I'm sorry, but we must leave
at the first available conjunction.
我很抱歉，但我们必须在第一次有可用连接时就离开

44
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,079
We'll take back all we can
for further study of course.
当然，我们尽可能带走一些东西，以供后续研究

45
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:17,285
But that is my decision
and that is what we must do.
但这是我的决定，也是我们必须要做的

46
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:19,677
- I insist that...!
- My decision is final!
- 我坚持认为...  - 我这是最后决定！

47
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:23,999
We leave when the north hemisphere
is properly tangential,

48
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:27,397
which will be at 18.42.
也就是大约在18:42

49
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:29,354
Ah, Captain Hopper. Just the man.
啊，Hopper 队长，正要找你呢

50
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:32,006
- Can you be ready to blast off at 18.42?
- No.
- 你能准备好在18:42升空吗？  - 不能

51
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:35,685
I beg your pardon. Did I hear you right?
对不起，我没听错吧？

52
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:37,598
You are paid to take orders.
你拿了钱，就得遵从命令

53
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,325
Not impossible ones.
但做不到的命令就遵从不了

54
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:42,524
It's the fuel pumps.
Some character has balled-up the lot.
是燃油泵，某个人把它们破坏了

55
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,757
- What?  - Or someTHING.
- 什么？  - 或者是某个东西

56
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:49,602
Whatever it is, it's practically wrecked
our chances of leaving this planet.
不管是什么，基本上把我们离开这个星球的机会给破坏了

57
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:01,496
There's no doubt about it.
The major workings lie below.
毫无疑问，主要的工事都在下面

58
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:05,023
There are metal caverns
down there, all interconnected.
下面有两个金属窟窿，相互连接

59
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:06,984
If only we can get down to them.
要是我们能下到那里就好了

60
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,057
That's it! I've got it!
对了，我明白了！

61
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:15,059
Finally, a Boolean function
of symbolic logic.
最终，还是一个符号逻辑的布尔函数

62
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:18,025
- Logical, yes, but...
- Everything yields to logic.
- 有逻辑的，是，但是...  - 一切都暗合逻辑

63
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:20,621
- Our basic assumption, Doctor  - Really.

is cap function of 2A.
得到交集函数2A

67
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:36,500
I think perhaps your logic
is wearing a little thin.
我看你的逻辑有点站不住脚啊

68
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:39,624
I must have made a mistake.
I'll do it again more carefully.
我肯定犯了一个错误。我再仔细来一遍

69

72
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:55,699
2F, not 2A.
是 2F 不是 2A

73
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,617
(WHIRRING)

74
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:04,946
I've done it! I've done it!
我搞定了！我搞定了！

75
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:07,382
- Congratulations!  - But, Doctor, you...

Excellent. Now to work.
很好，现在去干活吧

77
00:19:10,747 --> 00:19:14,342
It'll be extremely cold down there.
We shall all need to put on warm clothing.

78
00:19:14,427 --> 00:19:16,338
Mr Viner, would you please get the anoraks?
Viner 先生，你能去把防寒服取来吗？

79
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:19,305
- Just a moment. Are we all going down?
- There's safety in numbers.
- 等一下，我们都要下去吗  - 人多安全些

00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,981
- I'm coming down with you.
- But my dear young lady...

83
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:29,376
- You heard me, Professor.  - Victoria.

84
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:31,617
You will be much safer up here.

89
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:45,024
(PARRY) If we're all ready,
I shall lead the descent.

90
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:47,985
Be ready to go back the instant I give the word.

- You know what to do?  - The hatch?

Of course. I am being selfish.

His strength will be useful to you 
down there. He must go down.

97
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:08,784

Remember what I said. Be very careful.

(KAFTAN) It seems we are left alone to wait.

100
00:20:24,227 --> 00:20:28,266
Captain Hopper brought food
from the rocket. You would like some?

101
00:20:28,347 --> 00:20:30,702
Rather! I'm ravenous.

Hurry up, we've no time to linger!
快点，我们没时间磨蹭了！

It's extremely cold down here,
even with these anoraks.

(JAMIE) You obviously knew what to expect.

105
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:44,420
Well, which way do we go?
喏, 我们走那条路？

106
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:47,305
I don't know. Let's try this one.
我不知道, 我们试试这边

107
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:48,706
Yes.
好

108
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:00,938
Hey, what on Earth?!
嘿, 这是什么鬼？

109
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:05,146
(PARRY) Behold, gentlemen,
the tombs of the Cybermen.
看啊, 先生们, 赛博人的坟墓

110
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:08,583
(JAMIE) Tombs? I don't see any tombs.

There, Jamie.
那儿, Jamie

112
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,098
Frozen forever.

00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:21,266
Like a gigantic honeycomb.
就像一个巨大的蜂巢

116
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:26,865
Like bees waiting for the signal
to arise from their winter sleep.
就像蜜蜂一样, 等着一个信号, 从他们的冬眠中苏醒

117
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:29,825
A signal they are never going to get.
他们永远也不会得到这个信号

118
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:31,982
We'd better get busy.
Everything must be recorded.
我们动作得快点, 所有东西都要录下来

119
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:33,502
It's too cold to remain here for long
这里太冷了，可没法待太久

120
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:36,624
Unless we find some way to warm things up.

121
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:39,898
You have hardly touched your coffee.

No, thank you. I'm much warmer now.

125
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:48,546
That's good.

00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:50,219
I...
我...

127
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:52,704
feel so sleepy.
觉得好困

128
00:22:04,307 --> 00:22:05,660
(WHIRRING)

129
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:08,658
(CLANG)

130
00:22:08,747 --> 00:22:11,136
- What was that?
- It sounded like the hatch.
- 那是什么声音？  - 听起来好像是舱门

131
00:22:15,747 --> 00:22:17,180
It's closed!
它被关上了！

132
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:20,065
What's the use?
We're trapped down here now.
关上做什么？我们现在被困在下面了

133
00:22:20,147 --> 00:22:22,456
We'll never survive in this cold.
在这么冷的地方我们没法存活

134
00:22:22,547 --> 00:22:24,139
Better get back.
最好是回去

135
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,740
Well?
怎样？

136
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:32,297
It's closed. What have they done that for?
What are they playing at up there?
被关上了．他们为什么这么做？他们在上面玩什么啊？

137
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:34,059
Maybe it wasn't them. Where's Jamie?
也许不是他们．Jamie 那里去了？

138
00:22:34,147 --> 00:22:35,899
He went up the ladder to try it.
他上梯子去试试

139
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:39,218
Professor. Professor, listen to me,
for heaven's sake!
教授, 教授, 听我说, 老天

140
00:22:40,947 --> 00:22:43,620
The hatch is down again.
We're trapped down here.
舱门又降下来了, 我们被困在下面了

141
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:46,380
But some of my party
are up there. Are you sure?
