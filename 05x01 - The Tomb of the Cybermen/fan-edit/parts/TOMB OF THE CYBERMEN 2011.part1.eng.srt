<b>The Tomb of the Cybermen</b>
(Whopix fan edit)

2
00:00:41,227 --> 00:00:43,980
Stand by. Everybody down.

3
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:37,982
50 pounds for the first man
to open the doors.

4
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:41,935
Miss Kaftan, I must remind you
that I am the leader of the...

5
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:02,302
- What happened?
- I don't know.

6
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:07,177
Well, he's not going to collect ï¿½50
from you or anybody else.

7
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:09,542
- Quiet. Quiet a minute.
- What's that?

8
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:11,538
Sounded like an engine.

9
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:13,026
(WHOOSHING)

10
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:16,941
- Something came down there!
- OK, Viner. I'll take care of this.

11
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:19,177
- Jim!
- OK. I've got it!

12
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:38,699
(LOW VOICES)

13
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:41,698
Hold it right there, friend.

14
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,023
If you put it like that, I will.

15
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:46,939
Hear that, Professor? English.

16
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:48,938
(PARRY) Yes. All right, Hopper.

17
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:51,060
Thank you.

18
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:53,138
Who are you and where are you from?

19
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,298
And you'd better have a good story.

20
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:57,059
Maybe you'll not get one.

21
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,582
Listen, fella.
We're not playing games.

22
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:03,137
- You'd better listen to him.
- What's been happening here?

23
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:10,623
He was killed as you appeared.

24
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:13,017
Ah. And you think we did it?

25
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:16,019
We had nothing to do
with the death of this man.

26
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:19,418
He appears
to have been electrocuted.

27
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,376
Trying to open these doors, perhaps?

28
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:25,061
- He seems to know all the answers.
- A wiseguy!

29
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:28,541
He must be a member
of a rival expedition.

30
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:30,060
(DOCTOR) Expedition?

31
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:33,344
We've tried to keep it secret.
Unsuccessfully, it appears.

32
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:35,622
Archaeologist written all over him.

33
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,778
- Really? Does it show?
- You see?

34
00:03:37,947 --> 00:03:40,780
It's impossible to keep a secret
in the scientific world.

35
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,586
- Doctor, what do you mean?
- Tell them, Doctor.

36
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:46,135
Not until they tell us
about their expedition.

37
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:48,616
This is
an archaeological expedition.

38
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:52,416
We are searching the universe
for the last remains of the Cybermen.

39
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:56,226
Cybermen?
You mean they came from here?

40
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:58,263
Of course. Telos was their home.

41
00:03:58,427 --> 00:04:00,224
This is the entrance to their city.

42
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:04,459
We know they died out centuries ago,
but we don't know why they died out.

43
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:08,620
Callum, Rogers! Get him back
to the rocket. I'll be with you soon.

44
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:11,904
That's that. Are you coming back
with me, Professor?

45
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:14,785
- What for?
- You're not going on with this?

46
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:17,301
I don't know if they had
anything to do with it,

47
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:21,175
but one of my men is dead.
You're not paying that kind of money.

48
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,781
- I suppose that's true.
- You think it over.

49
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:26,700
Come on, let's go.
We'll wait for you at the ship.

50
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:29,665
The problem is
to open these doors, right?

51
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:32,056
- Ha! Brilliant.
- That is the problem.

52
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,661
Please return
to wherever you came from.

53
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:37,580
- Not very friendly, are they?
- Do as he says.

54
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:41,296
That became impossible when
that name was mentioned - Cybermen.

55
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:43,105
Cybermen? What are they?

56
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:46,543
- They're on the same quest!
- There's no other reason to come.

57
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:48,186
- We must stay!
- Doctor!

58
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,906
Must we? I don't like
the look of those things.

59
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:54,104
- We shall help you.
- Perhaps we don't want help.

60
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:57,975
That's just it. You obviously do.
I can open those doors for you.

61
00:04:58,147 --> 00:04:59,546
It's our problem!

62
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:02,778
Take your ridiculous expedition
off this planet!

63
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:05,177
We have as much right here
as you have.

64
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:09,499
Of course you have. Mr Klieg,
you do not speak for this expedition.

65
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:13,626
I am its leader. You and Miss Kaftan
are only here on sufferance.

66
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:16,221
- And who's paying for that rocket?
- (KAFTAN) Me!

67
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:19,060
I made it clear
that your financial support

68
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:22,105
did not entitle you
to a say in this expedition!

69
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,417
Of course. It was quite clear.

70
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:26,418
Was it not, Eric?

71
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:29,704
Of course.
No one questions your leadership.

72
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:32,222
Good. That's all settled.

73
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:35,936
- And now we shall open these doors.
- What...?

74
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:39,059
- Careful, man!
- Doctor!

75
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,660
Perfectly safe now.

76
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:52,863
- You'll be killed!
- Don't touch him!

77
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:00,506
- It's beyond my strength.
- Let me, Doctor.

78
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:07,297
I've not had much exercise lately.

79
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:10,857
Quite. I think here is a man
who could open these doors for us.

80
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:14,098
He is my servant.
I will not have him risk his life.

81
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:18,226
Surely it was for a contingency
like this that we brought him with us.

82
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:21,106
There's no danger now.
Unless he's afraid.

83
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:23,098
No, no. He's not afraid.

84
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,023
- Come on.
- No. Wait!

85
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:53,905
I would be very careful in there
if I were you.

86
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:56,262
Why weren't you both killed?

87
00:06:56,347 --> 00:07:00,306
The poor fellow who died drained
all the electricity out of his body.

88
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,139
It's perfectly safe to go in now.

89
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:03,819
We're wasting time.

90
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:06,946
Of course. After you, Professor.

91
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,499
But I'd still...

92
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:16,376
I'd still be very careful
if I were you. Very careful indeed.

93
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:19,104
Come on. Let's join them.

94
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,265
Come on, Victoria.

95
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,897
You look very nice in that dress.

96
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:30,217
Thank you.
Don't you think it's a bit...?

97
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:33,299
Short? I shouldn't worry.
Look at Jamie's.

98
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,742
I'll have you know that... Oh, aye.

99
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:38,466
Come along. Let's see
what the others are doing.

100
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:51,419
(VICTORIA)
Mercy! Just look at this place.

101
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:53,896
These controls
are of earlier dynasties.

102
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,785
Not so early. Look, John...

103
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,540
I'm quite capable
of making my own deductions!

104
00:07:58,627 --> 00:07:59,946
All right.

105
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,978
Be careful. There might be danger.

106
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:06,025
Don't worry,
with Toberman to guard me.

107
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:08,940
It's more important
to watch these strangers.

108
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:12,383
- I tried to...!
- Do not raise your voice.

109
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:16,860
You look after the Doctor
and I will watch the girl.

110
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:19,825
- And the Scots boy?
- Leave him to Toberman.

111
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,986
Eh, Toberman?

112
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:26,026
- You will be discreet. Understand?
- I understand.

113
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:29,896
- Did you ever see the like of it?
- Not exactly, Jamie, but nearly.

114
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:33,303
(PARRY) Now that we're all here...

115
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:38,381
Now that we're all here, we'd better
take stock of the situation.

116
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,662
This appears to be a dead end.

117
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:43,136
The only way out
is through that hatch.

118
00:08:43,307 --> 00:08:46,105
- Are there no doors?
- No. Apart from the entrance.

119
00:08:46,187 --> 00:08:48,178
- And the other two.
- Two other doors?

120
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:52,101
Yes. One in that section
and one in that section over there.

121
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:55,463
Activated, I imagine,
by this system here.

122
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:57,981
Here we are, I think.

123
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:04,577
(BLEEPING)

124
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:07,101
Yes, splendid!
A simple logical gate.

125
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:15,938
Doctor, you seem to be
very familiar with this place.

126
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:19,417
Not really.
It's all based on symbolic logic.

127
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:21,259
The same as you use in computers.

128
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:24,384
The opening mechanism -
an O.R. gate, as you call it.

129
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:27,584
I can see that, but how did you know
in the first place?

130
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,658
I use my own special technique.

131
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:32,215
Really?
And may we know what that is?

132
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:35,536
Keeping my eyes open
and my mouth shut.

133
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:40,137
We are too many to explore together.
We'd better divide up.

134
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:44,140
If you, Mr Viner,
would take that door with...

135
00:09:44,227 --> 00:09:46,536
- Jamie.
- Jamie and Mr Haydon.

136
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,505
Mr Klieg, the Doctor and myself
will be a party.

137
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:52,499
- What about us?
- The women should remain here.

138
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:54,817
Rubbish! We can make a party.

139
00:09:54,907 --> 00:09:58,616
Certainly. With Toberman
to guard us, we need fear no one.

140
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:00,777
Mr Klieg,
will you take them with you?

141
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,017
- I prefer to stay here.
- As you wish.

142
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:05,826
Mr Viner, will you
go along with the women?

143
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:09,741
- If you like.
- Get back to the spacecraft by 16.30.

144
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:12,057
You know
the temperature drop at night,

145
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:14,820
so we'll meet here at 16.25.

146
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:18,456
If anyone is missing, that gives us
an hour to look for them.

147
00:10:18,547 --> 00:10:21,778
Come on. We might as well
try that opening over there.

148
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:24,744
We'd better keep close together.

149
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:26,897
I'm all right, thank you.

150
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:30,545
- Come on, Jamie.
- Right.

151
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:33,858
Now to concentrate on this,
whatever it is.

152
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:36,336
This hatch must lead somewhere

153
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,782
and there must be
some opening mechanism.

154
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:43,258
What was that
about symbolic logic? Any ideas?

155
00:10:43,787 --> 00:10:45,345
No, not really.

156
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:48,100
I think it's time
we gave Mr Klieg a chance

157
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:50,542
to show off
his archaeological skills.

158
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:55,819
Come on. Right in.

159
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:00,820
Where's Toberman?

160
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:02,977
I sent him to join the others.

161
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:06,264
We do not need protection
now that you are with us.

162
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:08,417
Yes. Well, shall we commence?

163
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:11,340
Everything must be
carefully measured and recorded.

164
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:12,919
What is this room?

165
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:16,761
I don't know. Possibly this is
where the Cybermen are made.

166
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:19,319
I wonder what this is.

167
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:27,443
Do you mind? You're in my way.
Just go over there.

168
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:28,846
Oh, fiddle!

169
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:32,238
Could this not be
the purpose of the room?

170
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:33,646
Yes?

171
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:38,005
A Cyberman would stand
in that form and be...

172
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:41,441
Well, revitalised.

173
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:44,639
Yes, that's reasonable.

174
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:50,403
These projectors probably fired in
some neuro-electric potential.

175
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,879
That's it. I think you're right.

176
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,116
Revitalising is just what I need.

177
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:01,319
Mercy! The Cybermen
must have been giants!/

178
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:15,166
Well?

179
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:19,461
The basis of this code
is binary to digital conversion,

180
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:22,698
with an intervening step
involving a Whitehead logic.

181
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:25,859
When this Bourrier series
is complete, it's done.

182
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:27,665
Yes, but why do it at all?

183
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,945
For an archaeologist,
you're curiously lacking in curiosity.

184
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:35,656
Some things are better left undone
and this is one of them.

185
00:12:35,747 --> 00:12:37,578
What do you mean by that?

186
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,862
- It's all too easy, isn't it?
- Easy?

187
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:41,983
I wouldn't call this an easy survey.

188
00:12:42,147 --> 00:12:45,537
Everything is designed
to keep their secrets insoluble.

189
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:47,822
Insoluble? Oh, I wouldn't say that.

190
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:52,298
Take this mathematical sequence.
I'm really no nearer to its solution.

191
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:55,743
I've tried every combination.
It's hardly easy.

192
00:12:55,827 --> 00:13:00,025
Yes. Well, what you've done here
is mostly right.

193
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:03,577
- Thank you (!)
- You see, any progressive series

194
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,897
can be converted
into binary notation.

195
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:08,865
If you take the sum of the integrets

196
00:13:08,947 --> 00:13:11,507
and express the result
as a power series,

197
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:14,260
then the indices show
the basic binary blocks.

198
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:18,056
Only I wouldn't do it if I were you.
I really wouldn't do it.

199
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:21,945
Of course! You're right!

200
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:30,977
(LOW HUMMING)

201
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:35,619
Look! Sum between limits
of one and 91

202
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:39,097
integral into power series...
Yes, yes!

203
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,735
Then you differentiate...

204
00:13:44,587 --> 00:13:47,101
You fool!
Why couldn't you leave it alone?

205
00:13:47,187 --> 00:13:49,064
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

206
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:53,026
Perhaps the Cybermen aren't dormant.
We must find the others./

207
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:03,917
- Is that all?
- Aye.

208
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:05,918
All except this. What does that do?

209
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:07,963
I'm not sure, but we'll find out.

210
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,641
I'm going to trace the source
of these shapes.

211
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:13,367
There must be a projector somewhere.

212
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:16,322
- When I say, press the button.
- The big one?

213
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:18,318
Maybe it works with the others.

214
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:21,763
- Ready when you are.
- OK. Go ahead.

215
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:32,438
- Jamie, don't touch that control!
- I already have.

216
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:34,802
- What's the matter?
- Which one was it?

217
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:36,206
What?

218
01:00:11,327 --> 01:00:13,124
There we are.

219
01:00:15,687 --> 01:00:17,803
Well, what do you think?

220
01:00:18,967 --> 01:00:22,118
I don't know. I can't believe it.

221
01:00:23,407 --> 01:00:25,238
It's so big.

222
01:00:26,407 --> 01:00:29,638
- Where are we?
- Oh, it's the Tardis. It's my home.

223
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:32,446
It has been for
a considerable number of years.

224
01:00:32,607 --> 01:00:35,201
What are all these knobs?

225
01:00:35,367 --> 01:00:37,483
What, these?

226
01:00:37,647 --> 01:00:41,162
Instruments. These are
for controlling our flight.

227
01:00:41,807 --> 01:00:43,126
Flight?

228
01:00:43,287 --> 01:00:46,165
Well, yes.
We travel through time and space.

229
01:00:48,287 --> 01:00:51,324
No, no, no. Don't laugh. It's true.

230
01:00:49,247 --> 01:00:50,760
Oh, no.

231
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:52,485
Well, there you go.

232
01:00:52,127 --> 01:00:55,483
Your father and Maxtible
were working on the same problem,

233
01:00:52,567 --> 01:00:55,957
You blast one lump of rock
and all you've got is another.

234
01:00:55,567 --> 01:00:59,685
but I have perfected
a rather special model,

235
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:59,523
(LOW RUMBLING)

236
01:00:59,767 --> 01:01:03,157
which enables me to travel
through the universe of time.

237
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:02,163
No, wait a minute! Look!

238
01:01:03,247 --> 01:01:04,566
How can you?

239
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:08,117
I mean, if what you say is true,
you must be... Well...

240
01:01:05,487 --> 01:01:08,957
Man, you just blew yourself
a pair of doors!

241
01:01:09,047 --> 01:01:11,561
(CLAPPING AND CHEERING)

242
01:01:09,367 --> 01:01:11,005
How old?

243
01:01:11,087 --> 01:01:16,207
Well, in Earth terms, I suppose
I must be about four hundred...

244
01:01:11,647 --> 01:01:13,842
Well, come on!
What are we waiting for?

245
01:01:16,967 --> 01:01:18,639
About 450 years old.

246
01:01:19,207 --> 01:01:22,279
Yes, well... Quite.

247
01:01:22,447 --> 01:01:26,998
I think Victoria might find
that dress a little impracticable

248
01:01:27,087 --> 01:01:29,043
if she's going to join us.

249
01:01:29,127 --> 01:01:32,164
Jamie, show her where
she can find some new ones.

250
01:01:32,247 --> 01:01:33,566
Right.

251
01:01:33,647 --> 01:01:35,638
- This way.
- Mustn't stand about.

252
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:41,156
Try to give us a smooth take-off.
We don't want to frighten her.

253
01:01:41,687 --> 01:01:43,996
A smooth take-off?

254
01:01:46,207 --> 01:01:49,358
A smooth take-off?! What a nerve!

255
01:01:50,527 --> 01:01:52,518
(WHOOSHING)

256
01:02:10,767 --> 01:02:12,723
Hey, Toberman!

257
01:02:13,847 --> 01:02:15,678
Get that big head down!

258
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:25,086
What's the matter?
Have you gone mad?

259
01:02:25,247 --> 01:02:27,841
Doesn't he realise
the danger he's in?

260
01:02:27,927 --> 01:02:29,246
(SNIGGER)

261
01:02:29,327 --> 01:02:32,876
Don't laugh. None of us knows
what'll happen when we press it.

262
01:02:33,047 --> 01:02:35,402
Especially in this
rarefied atmosphere.

263
01:02:35,487 --> 01:02:39,844
Viner, no need to get excited. Can't
you keep your servant under control?

264
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:41,645
If I wish, I can.

265
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:53,119
According to the map, that should be
the entrance to the city of Telos.

266
01:02:53,207 --> 01:02:55,846
I hope you're right.
I want to get out of here.

267
01:02:55,927 --> 01:03:00,205
Hopper, you're being well paid
for your part in this expedition.

268
01:03:00,367 --> 01:03:01,686
Big deal!

269
01:03:02,727 --> 01:03:06,117
Sorry. We had to make it
a pretty big one.

270
01:03:06,287 --> 01:03:09,996
All right. Let's get on with it.
We've wasted enough time.

271
01:11:10,447 --> 01:11:13,439
I love to see
the experts at work, don't you?

272
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,766
Please be careful!

273
01:12:45,847 --> 01:12:49,078
In archaeological work,
nothing must be touched

274
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:50,964
until it's been recorded.

275
01:12:53,287 --> 01:12:57,838
All the corridors in here are light,
yet there are no windows.

276
01:12:57,927 --> 01:12:59,599
- Alpha-mason phosphor.
- Eh?

277
01:12:59,687 --> 01:13:01,757
A lighting system
that never goes out.

278
01:13:01,847 --> 01:13:04,361
Cosmic rays bombard
a layer of barium...

279
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:05,766
Aye, that.

280
01:13:05,927 --> 01:13:08,395
Point is,
what is this room used for?

281
01:13:08,487 --> 01:13:11,445
Possibly for raising caterpillars,
like this one.

282
01:13:11,527 --> 01:13:13,518
Watch out until we know what it is!

283
01:13:13,607 --> 01:13:15,120
It's as dead as a stone.

01:18:51,487 --> 01:18:53,125
Aaagh!

285
01:18:55,447 --> 01:18:57,039
- Did you touch anything?
- No.

286
01:18:57,127 --> 01:18:59,766
Keep away from that board.
Here, help me.

287
01:18:59,847 --> 01:19:01,644
- One moment.
- Now!

288
01:19:06,647 --> 01:19:08,763
We'll need a crowbar
to get this off.

289
01:19:08,927 --> 01:19:10,997
It may already be too late.

290
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:13,283
- That's strange.
- What?

291
01:19:13,367 --> 01:19:17,280
- I could swear that thing moved.
- You're seeing things, old chap.

292
01:19:17,447 --> 01:19:20,439
Come and look. The control panel
is active suddenly.

293
01:19:20,527 --> 01:19:22,677
Don't know
which button to press first.

294
01:19:22,767 --> 01:19:26,203
- I wouldn't if I were you.
- I think I'll try this one.

295
01:19:28,727 --> 01:19:30,046
Nothing.

296
01:19:30,127 --> 01:19:33,881
Wait a minute. What's happening?
It's getting dark.

Hey, look at the far wall!

298
01:19:40,327 --> 01:19:42,921
It's no use.
I daren't touch anything.

299
01:19:43,007 --> 01:19:45,646
If I operate the wrong sequence,
she'll die.

300
01:19:45,727 --> 01:19:48,605
I must find the logical order.
If it's not too late.

302
01:19:58,807 --> 01:20:01,116
- She's still alive!
- Thank heavens!

303
01:20:01,767 --> 01:20:03,678
I'll get the others. You stay here.

304
01:20:03,767 --> 01:20:05,758
- But hurry.
- I won't be long.

(HUMMING)

307
01:20:25,207 --> 01:20:28,916
I wouldn't touch the projector
controls. Someone might get hurt.

308
01:20:29,887 --> 01:20:32,799
- There must be a way to release it.
- Yes. Let me see.

309
01:20:32,967 --> 01:20:34,286
Jamie.

310
01:20:35,047 --> 01:20:36,639
Jamie, don't watch it.

311
01:20:36,807 --> 01:20:38,126
I must.

312
01:20:38,207 --> 01:20:41,722
I must. I can't seem
to take my eyes off it.

313
01:20:43,607 --> 01:20:46,246
I don't want to take my eyes off it.

314
01:20:46,327 --> 01:20:48,716
- I don't want to take my eyes...
- Stop, Jamie!

315
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:50,684
Yes, yes. I see it now.

316
01:20:54,807 --> 01:20:57,685
- Are you all right?
- Where have I been?

317
01:20:57,767 --> 01:20:59,644
Under some form of hypnosis.

318
01:20:59,727 --> 01:21:02,719
What would Cybermen want
with a hypnotising machine?

319
01:21:02,807 --> 01:21:06,720
It must be for something else.
Know what it could be?

320
01:21:06,887 --> 01:21:08,957
- What?
- Some kind of target.

321
01:21:09,047 --> 01:21:12,756
They used to have something like it
on Earth years ago.

322
01:21:12,847 --> 01:21:14,360
How does it work?

323
01:21:14,447 --> 01:21:17,484
- There's a subliminal centre.
- Oh, aye.

324
01:21:17,647 --> 01:21:21,162
- A what?
- Let's run it, but don't watch.

325
01:21:21,327 --> 01:21:23,682
You work the controls
and I'll watch.

326
01:21:23,767 --> 01:21:25,086
Right.

327
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:27,635
OK. Press the buttons.

328
01:21:28,927 --> 01:21:31,316
I think this is it.
Stand by to let her out.

329
01:21:31,407 --> 01:21:34,046
And if you, my dear,
would stand well clear.

330
01:21:35,767 --> 01:21:37,120
Right!

331
01:21:37,207 --> 01:21:39,004
Victoria, are you all right?

332
01:21:39,847 --> 01:21:42,645
It's all right. Catch your breath.

333
01:21:42,727 --> 01:21:44,046
It's all right.

334
01:21:47,407 --> 01:21:50,001
I didn't like that very much,
Doctor.

335
01:21:50,087 --> 01:21:54,603
I don't expect you did. You'll have
to be more careful in future.

336
01:21:54,687 --> 01:21:57,520
Come along. We must see
whether Jamie is all right.

337
01:22:01,407 --> 01:22:04,604
There must be some way
to get that hatch open.

338
01:22:04,767 --> 01:22:07,201
