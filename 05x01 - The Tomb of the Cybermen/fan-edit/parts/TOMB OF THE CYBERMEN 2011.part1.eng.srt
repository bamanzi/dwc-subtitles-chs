<b>The Tomb of the Cybermen</b>
(Whopix fan edit)

2
00:00:41,227 --> 00:00:43,980
Stand by. Everybody down.

3
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:37,982
50 pounds for the first man
to open the doors.

4
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:41,935
Miss Kaftan, I must remind you
that I am the leader of the...

5
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:02,302
- What happened?
- I don't know.

6
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:07,177
Well, he's not going to collect ï¿½50
from you or anybody else.

7
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:09,542
- Quiet. Quiet a minute.
- What's that?

8
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:11,538
Sounded like an engine.

9
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:13,026
(WHOOSHING)

10
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:16,941
- Something came down there!
- OK, Viner. I'll take care of this.

11
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:19,177
- Jim!
- OK. I've got it!

12
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:38,699
(LOW VOICES)

13
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:41,698
Hold it right there, friend.

14
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,023
If you put it like that, I will.

15
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:46,939
Hear that, Professor? English.

16
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:48,938
(PARRY) Yes. All right, Hopper.

17
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:51,060
Thank you.

18
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:53,138
Who are you and where are you from?

19
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,298
And you'd better have a good story.

20
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:57,059
Maybe you'll not get one.

21
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,582
Listen, fella.
We're not playing games.

22
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:03,137
- You'd better listen to him.
- What's been happening here?

23
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:10,623
He was killed as you appeared.

24
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:13,017
Ah. And you think we did it?

25
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:16,019
We had nothing to do
with the death of this man.

26
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:19,418
He appears
to have been electrocuted.

27
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,376
Trying to open these doors, perhaps?

28
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:25,061
- He seems to know all the answers.
- A wiseguy!

29
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:28,541
He must be a member
of a rival expedition.

30
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:30,060
(DOCTOR) Expedition?

31
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:33,344
We've tried to keep it secret.
Unsuccessfully, it appears.

32
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:35,622
Archaeologist written all over him.

33
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,778
- Really? Does it show?
- You see?

34
00:03:37,947 --> 00:03:40,780
It's impossible to keep a secret
in the scientific world.

35
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,586
- Doctor, what do you mean?
- Tell them, Doctor.

36
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:46,135
Not until they tell us
about their expedition.

37
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:48,616
This is
an archaeological expedition.

38
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:52,416
We are searching the universe
for the last remains of the Cybermen.

39
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:56,226
Cybermen?
You mean they came from here?

40
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:58,263
Of course. Telos was their home.

41
00:03:58,427 --> 00:04:00,224
This is the entrance to their city.

42
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:04,459
We know they died out centuries ago,
but we don't know why they died out.

43
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:08,620
Callum, Rogers! Get him back
to the rocket. I'll be with you soon.

44
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:11,904
That's that. Are you coming back
with me, Professor?

45
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:14,785
- What for?
- You're not going on with this?

46
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:17,301
I don't know if they had
anything to do with it,

47
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:21,175
but one of my men is dead.
You're not paying that kind of money.

48
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,781
- I suppose that's true.
- You think it over.

49
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:26,700
Come on, let's go.
We'll wait for you at the ship.

50
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:29,665
The problem is
to open these doors, right?

51
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:32,056
- Ha! Brilliant.
- That is the problem.

52
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,661
Please return
to wherever you came from.

53
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:37,580
- Not very friendly, are they?
- Do as he says.

54
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:41,296
That became impossible when
that name was mentioned - Cybermen.

55
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:43,105
Cybermen? What are they?

56
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:46,543
- They're on the same quest!
- There's no other reason to come.

57
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:48,186
- We must stay!
- Doctor!

58
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,906
Must we? I don't like
the look of those things.

59
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:54,104
- We shall help you.
- Perhaps we don't want help.

60
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:57,975
That's just it. You obviously do.
I can open those doors for you.

61
00:04:58,147 --> 00:04:59,546
It's our problem!

62
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:02,778
Take your ridiculous expedition
off this planet!

63
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:05,177
We have as much right here
as you have.

64
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:09,499
Of course you have. Mr Klieg,
you do not speak for this expedition.

65
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:13,626
I am its leader. You and Miss Kaftan
are only here on sufferance.

66
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:16,221
- And who's paying for that rocket?
- (KAFTAN) Me!

67
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:19,060
I made it clear
that your financial support

68
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:22,105
did not entitle you
to a say in this expedition!

69
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,417
Of course. It was quite clear.

70
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:26,418
Was it not, Eric?

71
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:29,704
Of course.
No one questions your leadership.

72
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:32,222
Good. That's all settled.

73
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:35,936
- And now we shall open these doors.
- What...?

74
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:39,059
- Careful, man!
- Doctor!

75
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,660
Perfectly safe now.

76
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:52,863
- You'll be killed!
- Don't touch him!

77
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:00,506
- It's beyond my strength.
- Let me, Doctor.

78
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:07,297
I've not had much exercise lately.

79
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:10,857
Quite. I think here is a man
who could open these doors for us.

80
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:14,098
He is my servant.
I will not have him risk his life.

81
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:18,226
Surely it was for a contingency
like this that we brought him with us.

82
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:21,106
There's no danger now.
Unless he's afraid.

83
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:23,098
No, no. He's not afraid.

84
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,023
- Come on.
- No. Wait!

85
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:53,905
I would be very careful in there
if I were you.

86
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:56,262
Why weren't you both killed?

87
00:06:56,347 --> 00:07:00,306
The poor fellow who died drained
all the electricity out of his body.

88
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,139
It's perfectly safe to go in now.

89
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:03,819
We're wasting time.

90
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:06,946
Of course. After you, Professor.

91
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,499
But I'd still...

92
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:16,376
I'd still be very careful
if I were you. Very careful indeed.

93
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:19,104
Come on. Let's join them.

94
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,265
Come on, Victoria.

95
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,897
You look very nice in that dress.

96
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:30,217
Thank you.
Don't you think it's a bit...?

97
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:33,299
Short? I shouldn't worry.
Look at Jamie's.

98
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,742
I'll have you know that... Oh, aye.

99
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:38,466
Come along. Let's see
what the others are doing.

100
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:51,419
(VICTORIA)
Mercy! Just look at this place.

101
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:53,896
These controls
are of earlier dynasties.

102
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,785
Not so early. Look, John...

103
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,540
I'm quite capable
of making my own deductions!

104
00:07:58,627 --> 00:07:59,946
All right.

105
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,978
Be careful. There might be danger.

106
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:06,025
Don't worry,
with Toberman to guard me.

107
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:08,940
It's more important
to watch these strangers.

108
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:12,383
- I tried to...!
- Do not raise your voice.

109
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:16,860
You look after the Doctor
and I will watch the girl.

110
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:19,825
- And the Scots boy?
- Leave him to Toberman.

111
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,986
Eh, Toberman?

112
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:26,026
- You will be discreet. Understand?
- I understand.

113
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:29,896
- Did you ever see the like of it?
- Not exactly, Jamie, but nearly.

114
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:33,303
(PARRY) Now that we're all here...

115
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:38,381
Now that we're all here, we'd better
take stock of the situation.

116
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,662
This appears to be a dead end.

117
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:43,136
The only way out
is through that hatch.

118
00:08:43,307 --> 00:08:46,105
- Are there no doors?
- No. Apart from the entrance.

119
00:08:46,187 --> 00:08:48,178
- And the other two.
- Two other doors?

120
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:52,101
Yes. One in that section
and one in that section over there.

121
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:55,463
Activated, I imagine,
by this system here.

122
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:57,981
Here we are, I think.

123
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:04,577
(BLEEPING)

124
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:07,101
Yes, splendid!
A simple logical gate.

125
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:15,938
Doctor, you seem to be
very familiar with this place.

126
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:19,417
Not really.
It's all based on symbolic logic.

127
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:21,259
The same as you use in computers.

128
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:24,384
The opening mechanism -
an O.R. gate, as you call it.

129
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:27,584
I can see that, but how did you know
in the first place?

130
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,658
I use my own special technique.

131
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:32,215
Really?
And may we know what that is?

132
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:35,536
Keeping my eyes open
and my mouth shut.

133
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:40,137
We are too many to explore together.
We'd better divide up.

134
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:44,140
If you, Mr Viner,
would take that door with...

135
00:09:44,227 --> 00:09:46,536
- Jamie.
- Jamie and Mr Haydon.

136
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,505
Mr Klieg, the Doctor and myself
will be a party.

137
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:52,499
- What about us?
- The women should remain here.

138
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:54,817
Rubbish! We can make a party.

139
00:09:54,907 --> 00:09:58,616
Certainly. With Toberman
to guard us, we need fear no one.

140
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:00,777
Mr Klieg,
will you take them with you?

141
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,017
- I prefer to stay here.
- As you wish.

142
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:05,826
Mr Viner, will you
go along with the women?

143
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:09,741
- If you like.
- Get back to the spacecraft by 16.30.

144
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:12,057
You know
the temperature drop at night,

145
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:14,820
so we'll meet here at 16.25.

146
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:18,456
If anyone is missing, that gives us
an hour to look for them.

147
00:10:18,547 --> 00:10:21,778
Come on. We might as well
try that opening over there.

148
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:24,744
We'd better keep close together.

149
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:26,897
I'm all right, thank you.

150
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:30,545
- Come on, Jamie.
- Right.

151
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:33,858
Now to concentrate on this,
whatever it is.

152
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:36,336
This hatch must lead somewhere

153
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,782
and there must be
some opening mechanism.

154
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:43,258
What was that
about symbolic logic? Any ideas?

155
00:10:43,787 --> 00:10:45,345
No, not really.

156
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:48,100
I think it's time
we gave Mr Klieg a chance

157
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:50,542
to show off
his archaeological skills.

158
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:55,819
Come on. Right in.

159
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:00,820
Where's Toberman?

160
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:02,977
I sent him to join the others.

161
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:06,264
We do not need protection
now that you are with us.

162
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:08,417
Yes. Well, shall we commence?

163
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:11,340
Everything must be
carefully measured and recorded.

164
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:12,919
What is this room?

165
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:16,761
I don't know. Possibly this is
where the Cybermen are made.

166
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:19,319
I wonder what this is.

167
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:27,443
Do you mind? You're in my way.
Just go over there.

168
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:28,846
Oh, fiddle!

169
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:32,238
Could this not be
the purpose of the room?

170
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:33,646
Yes?

171
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:38,005
A Cyberman would stand
in that form and be...

172
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:41,441
Well, revitalised.

173
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:44,639
Yes, that's reasonable.

174
00:11:45,807 --> 00:11:50,403
These projectors probably fired in
some neuro-electric potential.

175
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,879
That's it. I think you're right.

176
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,116
Revitalising is just what I need.

177
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:01,319
Mercy! The Cybermen
must have been giants!/

178
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:15,166
Well?

179
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:19,461
The basis of this code
is binary to digital conversion,

180
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:22,698
with an intervening step
involving a Whitehead logic.

181
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:25,859
When this Bourrier series
is complete, it's done.

182
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:27,665
Yes, but why do it at all?

183
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,945
For an archaeologist,
you're curiously lacking in curiosity.

184
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:35,656
Some things are better left undone
and this is one of them.

185
00:12:35,747 --> 00:12:37,578
What do you mean by that?

186
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,862
- It's all too easy, isn't it?
- Easy?

187
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:41,983
I wouldn't call this an easy survey.

188
00:12:42,147 --> 00:12:45,537
Everything is designed
to keep their secrets insoluble.

189
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:47,822
Insoluble? Oh, I wouldn't say that.

190
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:52,298
Take this mathematical sequence.
I'm really no nearer to its solution.

191
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:55,743
I've tried every combination.
It's hardly easy.

192
00:12:55,827 --> 00:13:00,025
Yes. Well, what you've done here
is mostly right.

193
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:03,577
- Thank you (!)
- You see, any progressive series

194
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,897
can be converted
into binary notation.

195
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:08,865
If you take the sum of the integrets

196
00:13:08,947 --> 00:13:11,507
and express the result
as a power series,

197
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:14,260
then the indices show
the basic binary blocks.

198
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:18,056
Only I wouldn't do it if I were you.
I really wouldn't do it.

199
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:21,945
Of course! You're right!

200
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:30,977
(LOW HUMMING)

201
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:35,619
Look! Sum between limits
of one and 91

202
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:39,097
integral into power series...
Yes, yes!

203
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,735
Then you differentiate...

204
00:13:44,587 --> 00:13:47,101
You fool!
Why couldn't you leave it alone?

205
00:13:47,187 --> 00:13:49,064
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

206
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:53,026
Perhaps the Cybermen aren't dormant.
We must find the others./

207
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:03,917
- Is that all?
- Aye.

208
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:05,918
All except this. What does that do?

209
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:07,963
I'm not sure, but we'll find out.

210
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,641
I'm going to trace the source
of these shapes.

211
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:13,367
There must be a projector somewhere.

212
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:16,322
- When I say, press the button.
- The big one?

213
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:18,318
Maybe it works with the others.

214
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:21,763
- Ready when you are.
- OK. Go ahead.

215
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:32,438
- Jamie, don't touch that control!
- I already have.

216
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:34,802
- What's the matter?
- Which one was it?

217
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:36,206
What?
