1
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,360
How is Spain?

2
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,560
No holiday. That's for sure.

3
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,310
The house was definitely haunted

4
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,960
A 300 year old ghost.

5
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,400
The trouble was George, my client.

6
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,200
I don't think I completely convinced him
the ghost was friendly.

7
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,250
- Bloody foreigners.
- You say that? But you sent me.

8
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,574
Just because I got promoted, doesnt say I care about your less

9
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,220
Yes, Patsy. Let's try and keep our personal relationships
simple from a professional way, shall we?

10
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,350
Oh, you looked at the wrong side of the plain(??)

11
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,500
Well anyway, the Preternatural Research Bureau is in safe hands

12
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,680
In fact I have something for you

13
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,800
on the back seat

14
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,790
An army experiment? really?

15
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,730
I know its not your favorite, but...

16
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,990
You need a second opinion.

17
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,950
Yes, I guess I do

18
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,160
Enough of that (??)

19
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,700
what were you saying about personal relationships

20
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,440
Shit

21
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,970
Williams

22
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,230
Goona take this.

23
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,020
I'll call you

24
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,330
All right

25
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,500
My name is corporal 7891-alpha

26
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,670
a.ka. Paul Reynish

27
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,830
and this is my story

28
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,830
I've been in the army all my adult life

29
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,200
and that's a very long time

30
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,800
a very long time

31
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,160
So,

32
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,010
what's so special about me?

33
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,390
Nothing. really

34
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,270
Except for one thing

35
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,380
Time

36
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,330
all the time in the world on my hands

37
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,300
I'm the covert MOD experiment

38
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,200
the one off test into longevity

39
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,730
I was in Bosnia, too

40
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,320
a never-aging military asset

41
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,470
Lower your weapon.

42
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,470
That is when I met Josie

43
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,060
But Josie didn't last

44
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,720
She had other fish to fry

45
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,490
Its funny, but after all these years, I'm still
learning to take the rough with the smooth(??)

46
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,220
I suppose I should consider myself lucky

47
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,640
Well, I know I'm costing the MOD millions

48
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,870
That's how much it takes to process these little babies

49
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,260
They're made from a martian meteorite

50
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,540
So they tell me

51
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,330
I don't understand how they work. but...

52
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,340
They do.

53
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,880
Come on

54
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,420
You got a big day tomorrow

55
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,550
Come to bed

56
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,580
All right, Bossy boost(??)

57
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
You'll be there tomorrow, won't you?

58
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,710
Fuck!

59
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,790
Everything ok?

60
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,270
I'm fine.

61
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,810
Morning, Dr. Shaw.

62
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,180
Hey, you're back. How was that? (??)

63
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,280
I don't know, somebody out there.

64
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,720
Wow, where did you find it?

65
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,530
In the storage hold.
On the Dr. Smith's shelf.

66
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,950
John Smith, Dr. John Smith.

67
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,810
It's Box, and never worked

68
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,130
Yeah, well, I'm gonna fix it.

69
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,400
Good luck, Gilles.

70
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,900
Whats that?

71
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,844
Priority job

72
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:06,500
And another one?

73
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,160
Liz, we got a case load as long as your arm.

74
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,960
I know, but this is important.

75
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,220
Giles

76
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,540
All right.

77
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,400
- Where do we start?  - Here.

78
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,860
When I'm not in battle, this, is where I live.

79
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,260
MOD covert operations HQ.

80
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,480
Let me know if it gets too tight and I don't think that...

81
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,400
Bennett is the latest professor to keep an eye on me.

82
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,620
We really erased(?)

83
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,320
- Do I look relaxed?
- For you (??), yes you do.

84
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,260
He does his best to make me feel at home

85
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,468
You see, Bennett's different to the others.

86
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:59,000
The key thing is the end...

87
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,100
Less distant. I liked him from the start.

88
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,440
He makes me laugh.

89
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,680
...doesnt' underdeveloped one...

90
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,140
It is one of Bennett's jobs to regulate my medication

91
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,680
to keep me fit forever

92
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,770
and, I suppose to keep me alive

93
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,480
I wonder how it would be if I stop taking these

94
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,410
I suppose I might be about to find out

95
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,690
I've had a look at your file, and...

96
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,550
Bennett told me there's a big debate going on about the costs

97
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,920
can they justify the expense?

98
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,080
Who said that?

99
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,390
Just relax yourself

100
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,600
The whole thing has left me thinking

101
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,730
What's it all for?

102
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,900
I have no more relatives

103
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,870
No emotional tides.

104
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,300
These conflicts and war zones are my only destiny

105
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,420
Perhaps its for the best

106
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,130
happy chap  his knee (??)

107
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,510
more security with PROBE

108
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,430
oh  I get it

109
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:40,060
Haggard knows you've got a soft spot for the outsider,
and you'll cause no fuss

110
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,780
Shut up, Giles

111
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,740
Good afternoon, everybody!

112
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,880
As you know, the prime minister and I
made a joint statement in the house

113
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,730
about the current defense cuts

114
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:05,180
and today I'm going to outline exactly
where those cuts will fall

115
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,840
I want to focus on challenges... strategic landscape...

116
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,040
and new budget constraints

117
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,140
and the choices we have in responding to these challenges

118
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,920
And, the opportunities that exist
to fundamentally reshape the defence....

119
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,220
Gentlemen, this has not been an easy decision

120
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,580
It should never have come to this

121
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,060
But it has. In times of austerity
when must all tighten our belts (??)

122
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,002
Will he go quietly?

123
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,620
He is a soldier. He is an honourable man.

124
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,900
I'm sure, given time, he'll GUN?? intent to do it.

125
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,400
This must be quick, and it must be clean.

126
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,232
This little experiment has cost enough already.

127
00:12:57,232 --> 00:13:01,100
Yeah, all right, Major.
I appreciate you never approved of any of this.

128
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,900
Let's show some respect, shall we?

129
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,280
He is human

130
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,520
Barely

131
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,620
The procedure is all in place
and will be handled by Dr. Shaw at the PROBE.

132
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,810
Sorry

133
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:46,920
PROBE?

134
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,780
Don't worry, Sir. Shel'l be discreet.

135
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,830
Yeah, these things are killing

136
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,570
- Hi, you usual man boy(?)
- Thank you

137
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,070
Well?

138
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,320
But I look so surprised

139
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,860
There are things you don't know, Liz.

140
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,540
Is there anything in the pro box of tricks that night (?)

141
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,780
Do the job?

142
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,770
Patsy! Do the job?

143
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,370
You make the corporal sound like some machine.

144
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,610
Sorry.

145
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,940
You can take the girl out of the ministry (??)

146
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,640
But you can't take the ministry out of the girl.

147
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,280
Well

148
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,020
Your relentless

149
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,790
William's breathing down your neck again

150
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,720
Don't worry

151
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,290
I'm sure we'llfind something in the PROBE store.

152
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,770
So you are looking for a time loop converter?

153
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,810
Yeah

154
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,650
I'm gonna freak we're going to find one of those
with enough capacity to contain the courtfor(??)

155
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,330
There was such a device in the storage told

156
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,930
It wasn't me

157
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,260
It was me

158
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,191
- Box!
- Yes. Hello, Dr. Shaw.

159
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,620
It's you. In a box

160
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,820
My God, it works!

161
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,770
You fixed it!

162
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,700
Second island on the left.

163
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,820
Good thinking, Box

164
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,820
Thank you

165
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,720
Liz?

166
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,770
In here

167
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:40,250
Oh box does more than just talking.

168
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,170
Oh yes. Box is more than just a box.

169
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,876
Remember this?

170
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,160
How could I forget? 1995, wasn't it?

171
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,510
Bringing that witch back to life?

172
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,180
You sure this will work?

173
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,900
I mean, the corporal is about containment

174
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,720
- Positive.
- I wasn't talking to you.

175
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,490
You have any second thoughts?

176
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,960
This is a government organised execution

177
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,800
and I feel very uncomfortable about it

178
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,645
Hello, is that Charlie, Charlie Reynish?

179
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:41,880
- Hello
- Speaking

180
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,420
I'm Professtor Bennett, from the MOD.

181
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,860
And I'm a friend of your brother Paul.

182
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,440
- Paul? Paul's dead
- No, no, he's not dead.

183
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,720
I don't have time to explain.
You must get here now.

184
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,680
Paul, you're here ready.

185
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,970
Well, wouldn't want to be late for my own funeral, would I?

186
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,470
I fear, got somebody to meet you, Paul.

187
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,980
- Corporal 7891-Alpha
- I know.

188
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,700
Charlie's your brother, Paul.

189
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,710
Not much of a coffin (??)

190
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,080
Major Johnson might pursue (??)

191
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,740
Dr. Shaw.

192
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,490
Wait here

193
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,940
I'll send somebody to fetch you when we're ready.

194
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,420
Bennett, Dr. Shaw is here.

195
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,500
- Who are you?
- I'm Charlie.

196
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,540
- What are you doing here?
- I'll come to take him home

197
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,980
What, what would you mean?
You cant take him home.

198
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,040
Dr. Shaw. In here!

199
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,740
What the hell happened in here?

200
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:58,800
Wish I knew.

201
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,050
Bennett, what the hell have you done?

202
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,760
Something I should have done a long time ago.

203
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,080
Liz.

204
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,530
- They will be tracking us
- I'm not stupid

205
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,360
You seem to have lost control with the situation, Major.

206
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,560
- What are you going to do about it?
- Find him

207
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,810
I don't often give people second chances,
but I think I can trust you, Major.

208
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,330
Don't let me down

209
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,770
Understood. Leave it with me

210
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,200
- Yes, Pasty? - Liz, there's something more.

211
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,010
Drink?

212
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,750
No thanks

213
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,320
Remember this place?

214
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,770
They're going to find us, you know

215
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,880
Theres no need for PROBE anymore.
You can return to base.

216
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,840
No, Patsy. I'm staying here.

217
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,190
We can't forge your emotional state
to come into play here, Liz

218
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:29,120
I understand your backs up against the wall on this one

219
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,240
But you need me

220
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,090
You're right

221
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,290
But the major is in charge

222
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,750
I heard about the corporal, but of a shambles(??), don't you think?

223
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,420
So, let me get this straight. You led his brother in.

224
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,435
Charlie deserves to know that his brother is still alive.

225
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:55,336
But under the circumstances, this is now a right fuck up

226
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:58,078
- They're both on the run!
- I didn't know he'd be armed.

227
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:02,780
More importantly, Major,
why was the corporal told that Charlie was dead?

228
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,490
That had nothing to do with me.

229
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,060
It was one of my predecessors, Dr. Shaw

230
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,540
A big mistake, I can see that now.

231
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,220
Okey, enough talk

232
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,500
Now if you excuse me, I have to find the corporal

233
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,780
I trust you won't stand in my way

234
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,290
You can trust me, Major.

235
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,500
If you do the right thing

236
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,640
They have a gun, for Christ's sake

237
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,678
Bennett, you left me no choice.

238
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,120
I'm placing you under arrest

239
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,380
- I found the car.
- Excellent!

240
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,670
I'm on my way.

241
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,310
This doesn't change much.

242
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,990
They told me you had cancer.

243
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,610
Yeah, that much is true.

244
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,520
I'm sorry.

245
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,600
So, how did you find me?

246
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,610
- The professor.
- Bennett?

247
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,840
You're lying...Ah!

248
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,380
I need my meds.

249
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,100
Ready?

250
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,090
See what happens when I don't take my pills?

251
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,650
You're much the same if I don't have a drink

252
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,460
What did you hope to achieve,
storming in old guns blazing?

253
00:23:42,745 --> 00:23:44,660
I didn't have much time to be rational.

254
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,000
What do you want from me?

255
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,180
Not this.

256
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,390
I lost you once before.

257
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,700
I would never forgive myself.

258
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,510
If I didn't, at least try.

259
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,710
I thought...

260
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,900
by bringing you to this place

261
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,030
we'd at least have five minutes peace before...

262
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,850
I'm sorry.

263
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,250
You're all I have.

264
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,440
No

265
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,500
Its me you should be sorry

266
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,490
I'll go in.

267
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,900
I've got clear view, sir.

268
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,020
On my command

269
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,974
Dr. Shaw, what are you doing?

270
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:53,070
It's a bit extreme, isn't it, Major?

271
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,580
I have no choice.

272
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,860
- He's on the move, sir - Fire

273
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,480
I'll talk to Bennett.

274
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,644
that should buy some time and then...

275
00:25:05,644 --> 00:25:07,980
maybe you can put it in a safe house

276
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,650
Charlie!

277
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,030
What do you mean, you missed?

278
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,930
What about the corporal?

279
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,300
- He's on the move, Sir. - Shit!

280
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,240
Roman let it go. We're moving in.

281
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
We make sure we give him a decent burial.

282
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,120
Yes

283
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,900
The least we can do.

284
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,700
Sir, over here.

285
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,880
A tunnel, Sir.

286
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,280
It looks like it goes all the way to the village, Sir

287
00:26:07,014 --> 00:26:09,590
Right, you lot, over here.GG
Hagood wrote like this

288
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,149
I thought you had this under control

289
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:43,540
Escaping once is bad enough, but twice?

290
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,851
What kind of operation is running here

291
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:47,345
but looks very mickey mouse? (??)

292
00:26:47,345 --> 00:26:51,390
-I understand your first...
no, I don't think you do understand patsy

293
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,750
I'm about to brief the prime minister

294
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,750
I'm going to have to skirt around the fact that
we've screwed up such a simple task

295
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,540
Don't know about you,
but I'm rather keen to keep my job

296
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,330
Now get the grip?? GG

297
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,470
crack the whip

298
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,270
Let's get this little mess wrapped up minister

299
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,270
You looked surprised

300
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,610
Not really

301
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,690
I expected to find you here.

302
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,210
They're not to hate you?? Paul.

303
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,100
You know what? I'd noticed

304
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,410
Its worse than that

305
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,630
My husband wants you dead

306
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,000
Doesn't change anything

307
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,850
but I owe it to you.

308
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,180
I need my meds.

309
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,120
You're hurting me

310
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,250
Have you found him?

311
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,140
Not exactly

312
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,960
Why are you here?

313
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,700
I'm lost.

316
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,050
So how did you find Charlie?

317
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,770
All the family details 're on the records

318
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,280
I thought if they could just meet.

319
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,590
So this is it

320
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,770
Just 3 days left

321
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,240
This is a famous martian compound.

322
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,570
Without this, the corporal is dead

323
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,300
I don't mind telling you.

324
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,109
I'm really worried about this helplessness

325
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:36,490
Theres no time for anxiety,
we have to get him back to the lab

326
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,490
Don't worry about me, prof.

327
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:40,890
Paul.

328
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,920
You lied to me!

329
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,760
It's all right

330
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm Dr. Shaw, Liz.

331
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,900
You told me he was dead

332
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,270
We had to protect you,
it was done in your best interest.

333
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,560
You murdered him!

334
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,180
Are you all right?

335
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,010
Give them to me

336
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,650
- They're not here.
- Give me the pills!

337
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,440
What's happening to me? It burns.

338
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,320
You are in very volatile state

339
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,000
You need us. This is only phase 1.

340
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,620
What is vital, Paul? It's vatal we get you back
to the lab where we can get you stablized.

341
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,800
- I don't trust youGG
- When the body is giving up, its over.

342
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,910
Shut up

343
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,840
Shut up, shut up

344
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:42,830
- So you ARE one of them?
- No! I'm only trying to help

345
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,910
I had no idea you go so mad, I'm sorry

346
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,300
Don't worried, Dr. Shaw.

347
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,640
my team will find him and deal with him

348
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,680
No, no guns

349
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,730
too risky

350
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,510
so

351
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,230
we have no idea of what were dealing with

352
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,900
exactly

353
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,500
the corporal has left some skin

354
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,140
so at least I can run some tests

355
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,030
I'm home.

356
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,090
He is still on the run

357
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,290
But he shot two of our men

358
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,170
so we have this under control

359
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,470
dear god

360
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,160
one piece of skin can do that

361
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:36,690
yes

362
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,550
and is a ticking time bomb

363
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,077
- Where are you going?
- I have to recalibrate the chair.

364
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,780
- What about the corporal?
- He'll find us

365
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,980
- So, we wait?
- Not for long.

366
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,390
Liz!

367
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,550
Liz!

368
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,990
Shit

369
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,110
Most of cocktail (??)

370
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,040
I thought this was gonna be simple

371
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,620
How long can you be?

372
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,140
Stop

373
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,190
Don't put that away

374
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,370
Sir

375
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,640
Well?

376
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,780
nothing yet

377
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,620
Why the bloody hell haven't you found him?

378
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,070
Look at it
I'll come to the point

379
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,130
He show your chunks of proper up to this

380
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,610
You do realize what were dealing with

381
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,460
I am well aware, sir, of whats at stake

382
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,920
and I can't think of anyone more qualified than Dr. Shaw.

383
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,240
I hope you're right.

384
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,820
troll last 6 (??)

385
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,590
Oh,  no, shit

386
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:28,163
Not to implode (??) function to the elemental array

387
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:28,970
Good idea.

388
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,520
- Any news?
- We've some tests ??

389
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,430
And?

390
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,460
It's bad

391
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,390
Very bad

392
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,900
You think I made a mistake, don't you?

393
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,300
You've turned him into a monster

394
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,810
The calm before the storm

395
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,450
Now we're ready

396
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,410
Where are you?

397
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,560
Tiger located.

398
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,010
Dr. Shaw you're right

399
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,210
A ticking time bomb

400
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,270
has gone public

401
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,370
- Get the van ready - Sir

402
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,400
(Major Johnson)

403
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,690
Major.

404
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,690
You found it? where?

405
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,070
Shepherds Bush?

406
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,820
Quicky  ok  we will meet you there

407
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,970
We're going shopping

408
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,530
You're not going anywhere

409
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,030
If all this goes tits up  You're in charge

410
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,120
Where are you, I wonder?

411
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,470
Shit

412
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,330
I meant intercepting of transmission.


413
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:16,210
Major Johnson has just informed Haggard
that the corporal has a female hostage.

414
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,300
Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse

415
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,230
We just need to make sure that we've got a thorough briefing

416
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:35,450
- I presume we found him then
- As expected, sir, he found us

417
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,340
and there's something else

418
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,760
So?

419
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,750
Haggard, its not like you to beat around the Bush

420
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,880
It's Josie, Sir

421
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,570
Positions, gentlemen

422
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:05,700
Nice and discreet.
We don't want to disturb the natives,

423
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,610
and the corporal must not see us

424
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:32,870
Out

425
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,220
Now

426
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:51,390
- What the luck are you doing?
- Finishing the job.

427
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,800
Sit

428
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,510
You're hurt

429
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,700
More than you can imagine

430
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,770
Hold your positions

431
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,950
Where'd he taken her?

432
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,340
Security office

433
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:32,690
You were right

434
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:34,050
He has a plan

435
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,110
You can see everything that we do

436
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,560
Well

437
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:38,930
What's that.

438
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,640
That's the chair

439
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:44,920
Its the answer to all our prayers,
if we can get him to sit in it

440
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:45,990
Sir

441
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,590
Mrs Williams' number

442
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,930
Reasoning of what she said?

443
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,440
Good luck

444
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:02,580
Answer it

445
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,670
Hello? Mrs Williams, are you all right?

446
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,970
- Oh, I'm fine
- Is corporal there now, I need to talk to him

447
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,350
He has a gun

448
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,000
Its Major Johnson. He wants to talk to you

449
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,390
- Major
- Corporal

450
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,782
Is there anything you need from us?

451
00:45:28,782 --> 00:45:30,128
No, there's nothing I need.

452
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:31,710
- Are you sure?
- I said nothing.

453
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:35,010
Where are you going to take Mrs Williams

454
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,880
Mrs Williams will be watching the fireworks first hand

455
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:44,470
Corporal, you've made your point

456
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,020
There are thousands of people at risk.
You've got to stop this now, soldier.

457
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,130
- But I'm no longer a soldier, Major

458
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,002
They in the secretary discharged me, Remember?

459
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:57,220
- Now listening...
- No, major, I'm giving you the orders now.

460
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,250
Do nothing

461
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:00,970
Sit back

462
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,050
and watch

463
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,590
unless you want Josie's blood on your hands

464
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:08,710
- He won't hurt her.
- You heard what I said

465
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,230
- The men are ready, sir.
- Keep them where they are.

466
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,160
Though we know  attack (??) for now

467
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,520
Hold on your positions

468
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,750
Yes, I know!
We're running out of time.

469
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:29,770
Sorry

470
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,560
You could get out of my depth on this one

471
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,780
We all are, major.

472
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,100
We all are.

473
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,130
Liz

474
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,640
What's that?

475
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,600
it's box.

476
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:45,110
A gift from an old friend

477
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,110
Something looking present

478
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,640
Does it serve any purpose?

479
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,480
It keeps me on my toes

480
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,390
Anything, box?

481
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,510
Liz, I need to talk to you

482
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,720
Excuse me, major

483
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:03,210
- Where are you going?
- Take care of the chair.

484
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:21,050
Go left

485
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:31,800
Up there

486
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,240
- What's happening to you?
- Didn't your husband tell you

487
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,790
the MOD's most lethal weapon

488
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:21,240
is being decommissioned in the most spectacular style

489
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,290
She's pregnant

490
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,040
A boy

491
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:36,340
Do you have any children?

492
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,200
I know what you're thinking, Patricia

493
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,820
when the shit hits the fan...

494
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,060
Sir

495
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,120
Oh you...need help

496
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,070
I understand, Sir

497
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:02,430
that you are in an impossible position

498
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:03,710
I made up my mind

499
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:04,920
If you're sure, Sir

500
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,150
I am sure, major.
And, get the job done.

501
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,950
Understood, Sir. We'll do our best.

502
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,550
All the member going in.

503
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:09,290
Paul, you have to let me go.

504
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:15,170
You're not going... anywhere.

505
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,240
Sheer to stop. Remember?

506
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:27,400
and only if you can get a clear shot

507
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,530
Come on, major

508
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:46,220
Men, listen

509
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,070
We've run out of time

510
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,820
You move on my order

511
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,790
Remember,

512
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,110
Its vital to keep the corporal alive

513
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,080
Go

514
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,650
Shit!

515
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:58,120
Maybe you're not so valuable after all.

516
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:03,800
It's the PM

517
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,300
I'll call him back

518
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:11,590
Wait!

519
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,000
Give me the gun

520
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,570
It's over

521
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,060
She's pregnant

522
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,500
No

523
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:46,390
It's true

524
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:48,980
4 months.

525
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,370
It's boy.

526
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,430
Go

527
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,850
And Dr. Shaw...

528
00:53:39,056 --> 00:53:41,856
I'm running out of time.

529
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:00,480
You go.

530
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,420
That's a order, soldier

531
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:11,810
What's so...funny?

532
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,680
Our fate

533
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:15,660
and hand it deals us ??

534
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:17,309
What are you talking about?

535
00:54:17,309 --> 00:54:19,050
We're both a little crazy, aren't we?

536
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,760
You and me.

537
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,120
Oh, come on.

538
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,660
You know what I'm talking about?

539
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,300
What's it all for?
I hear myself shout

540
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,240
You brother Charlie knew, didn't he, Paul?

541
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:43,670
Of course he did. Bennett told him.

542
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,130
It was more than that

543
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:49,520
He kept going despite the fact
that he knew he was dying

544
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:51,321
Come on, Paul

545
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,670
You're better than that.

546
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,500
Do it

547
00:55:13,345 --> 00:55:15,234
Come in now.

548
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:28,310
Box?

549
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:14,710
Doctor Shaw

550
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,320
Yes, major?

551
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:19,050
I...I meant to say...

552
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:21,510
Thank you

553
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:50,070
What's this, a takeover bid?

554
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:51,000
Liz!

555
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:54,100
No.

556
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,000
There is only one boss of PROBE.

557
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,400
Thank God its all over.

558
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,090
What's the matter?

559
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:11,560
What?

560
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,020
Sit down

561
00:58:18,556 --> 00:58:19,650
What is it?

562
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,580
I'm thinking...

563
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,030
of jack Quinn ??

564
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:35,900
What

565
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,700
I'm thinking it maybe Spain

566
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:45,530
Spain? You mad?

567
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,140
What about me?

568
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,680
I'd want you to come with me

569
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:15,380

01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,860

572
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:37,760

No  no  its not 

573
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,680

575
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:53,600
