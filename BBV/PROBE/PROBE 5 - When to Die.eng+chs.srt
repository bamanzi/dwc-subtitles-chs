西班牙怎么样？
How is Spain?

2
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,560
完全没假日，这是肯定的
No holiday. That's for sure.

3
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,310
那房子绝对闹鬼
The house was definitely haunted

一个三百年的老鬼

00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,400
问题在于George，我那个客户
The trouble was George, my client.

6
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,200
那鬼没恶意，但我觉得没能完全说服他
I don't think I completely convinced him
the ghost was friendly.

7
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,250
- 这些外国人真恐怖 - 你还说这个，不是你让我去的？
- Bloody foreigners.
- You say that? But you sent me.

8
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,564
我是升职了，但不代表我对你的关心少了
Just because I got promoted, doesn't say I care about your less

9
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,640
是，Patsy，但我们还是尽量把咱们的私人关系
Yes, Patsy. But let's try
and keep our personal relationships simple

10
00:01:16,688 --> 00:01:18,220
跟工作区分开来，好不？
from a professional way, shall we?

11
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,350
噢，你总看到事情不好的一面
Oh, you looked at the wrong side of the plain(??)

12
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,500
不管怎样，超自然研究局(PROBE)还在可靠的人手里
Well anyway, the Preternatural Research Bureau is in safe hands

13
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,680

就在后座上
on the back seat

15

军队实验项目？真的吗？
An army experiment? really?

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,730
我知道你不太喜欢，但是...
I know its not your favorite, but...

17
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,990
你需要第三方意见
You need a second opinion.

18
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,950
是，我觉得是需要
Yes, I guess I do

19
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,160
不说这个了
Enough of that

20
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,700
刚才你是怎么说私人关系这事的？
what were you saying about personal relationships?

21
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,440
惨了
Shit

22
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,970

那么
So,

35
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,010
我为什么这么特殊？
what's so special about me?

36
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,390
没什么，真的
Nothing. really

37
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,270
只除了一件事

我手上有全世界的时间

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,300
我是国防部的一项秘密实验品
I'm the covert MOD experiment

很滑稽的是，即便过了这么多年

49
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:11,490
关于凡事都有好有坏这一点，我仍在学着接受
I'm still learning to take the rough with the smooth.

50
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,220
我觉得自己算是幸运的
I suppose I should consider myself lucky

51
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,640
对，我知道我消耗了国防部数百万
Well, I know I'm costing the MOD millions

52

这主要用来生产这些小玩意

嘿，你回来啦。怎么样？

我不知道，爱谁谁吧
I don't know, somebody out there.

69
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,720
哇噢，你在哪里找到的
Wow, where did you find it?

70
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,530
在仓储区，Smith 博士那个架子上
In the storage hold.
On the Dr. Smith's shelf.

72
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,810
是盒子，一直都不能用
It's Box, and never worked

73
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,130
是，但，我会修好它

74
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,400
祝你好运，Gilles

Liz, 我们积压的任务都有手臂长了

我知道，但这个很重要

80
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,220
Giles

81
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,540
好吧

- 从哪儿开始？  - 这里

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,860
当我不在战场上的时候，这里，就是我就住的地方

85
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,480
如果太紧了就告诉我，虽然我觉得不会...
Let me know if it gets too tight and I don't think that...

86
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,400
Bennett 是最近负责照看我的教授
Bennett is the latest professor to keep an eye on me.

87
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,620
We really erased(??)

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,320
- 我看起来很放松吗？  - 是的（？）

他尽他最大的努力让我有一种家的感觉

90
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,468
你看，Bennett 跟其他人不一样

91
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:59,000
到头来事情的关键是...
The key thing is the end...

92
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,100
比较有亲和力。我一开始就喜欢他
Less distant. I liked him from the start.

93
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,440
他总能让我开怀大笑

94
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,680

95

Bennett 的其中一项职责是给我定期配药

同时，我觉得，也是在保我的命

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,480
我很好奇，如果停止服用这些，会怎样
I wonder how it would be if I stop taking these

99
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,410
估计我可能快要发现了
I suppose I might be about to find out

100
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,690
我已经看过了你的档案...
I've had a look at your file, and...

101
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,550
Bennett 跟我说关于这些花费出现了大的争议
Bennett told me there's a big debate going on about the costs

102
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,920
他们能证明这些费用是正当的吗？
can they justify the expense?

103
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,080
谁说过这个？
Who said that?

104
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,390
尽量放松
Just relax yourself

105
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,600

The whole thing has left me thinking

106
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,730
这一切都是为了什么？
What's it all for?

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,900
我再也没有任何亲戚
I have no more relatives

108
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,870
也没有情绪波动

109
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,300
那些武装冲突和战区才是我唯一的宿命
These conflicts and war zones are my only destiny

110
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,420
或许这样最好
Perhaps its for the best

111
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,130
happy chap  his knee (??)

112
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,510
这跟PROBE有什么关系？
What's this gonna to do with PROBE?

113
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,430
哦，我明白了
Oh, I get it.

114
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,960
Haggard 知道你心里软
Haggard knows you've got a soft spot for the outsider

115
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,780
- 而且不会宣扬出去 - 闭嘴，Giles
- and you'll cause no fuss  - Shut up, Giles

116
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,740
大家下午好！
Good afternoon, everybody!

117
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,880
你们已经知道，首相和我在这间屋子发布了一个联合声明
As you know, the prime minister and I
made a joint statement in the house

118
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,730
是关于消减国防预算的
about the current defense cuts

119
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:05,180
今天我将会概括说明消减的是哪些费用
and today I'm going to outline exactly
where those cuts will fall

120
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,840
我想要强调一下面临的挑战...战略格局...
I want to focus on challenges... strategic landscape...

121
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,340
对预算新增加的制约条件
and new budget constraints

122
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,640
以及我们为应对这些挑战所持有的选项
and the choices we have in responding to these challenges

123
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,920
另外谈谈彻底重塑国防水平的机遇
And, the opportunities that exist
to fundamentally reshape the defence....

124
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,220
先生们，这一直不是一个容易做出的决定
Gentlemen, this has not been an easy decision

125
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,580
它就不应该走成现在这样
It should never have come to this.

126
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,060
但已经这样了。困难时期大家都得勒紧裤腰带
But it has. In times of austerity
we must all tighten our belts.

127
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,652
他会平静地离开吗？
Will he go quietly?

128
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,620
他是个战士，是个值得尊敬的人
He is a soldier. He is an honourable man.

129
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,900
我很肯定，给点时间，他会(??)
I'm sure, given time, he'll GUN?? intent to do it.

130
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,400
这事必须做的利落，做得干净
This must be quick, and it must be clean.

131
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,232
这个小实验已经耗费太多人力物力了
This little experiment has cost enough already.

132
00:12:57,232 --> 00:13:01,100
好了，少校。你一直都不赞成这事，我感激这一点
Yeah, all right, Major.
I appreciate you never approved of any of this.

133
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,900
我们还是展现一点尊重，行吗？
Let's show some respect, shall we?

134
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,280
他也是个人
He is human.

135
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,520
勉强而已
Barely

136
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,620
步骤都安排好了，会由 PROBE 的 Shaw 博士来处理
The procedure is all in place
and will be handled by Dr. Shaw at the PROBE.

137
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,810
抱歉
Sorry.

138
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:46,920
PROBE?

139
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,780
别担心，长官。她会谨慎处理的
Don't worry, Sir. Shel'l be discreet.

140
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,830
是，这些东西会杀人
Yeah, these things are killing

141
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,570
- 嗨，你的日常菜单  - 男孩，谢谢你！
- Hi, you usual menu  - Boy, thank you!

142
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,070
怎样？
Well?

143
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,320
I don't look so surprised.
我看起来好像并不感到意外

144
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,860
有些事你并不知道，Liz
There are things you don't know, Liz.

145
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,740
PROBE 的箱子里有没有什么神奇物件
Is there anything in the PROBE box of tricks

146
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,780
...能够搞定这事儿的？
that might ... do the job?

147
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,770
Pasty! 搞定这事儿?
Patsy! Do the job?

148
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,370
你把下士说得像是一种机器似的
You make the corporal sound like some machine.

149
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,610
抱歉
Sorry.

150
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,940
You can take the girl out of the ministry (??)

151
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,640
But you can't take the ministry out of the girl.

152
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,280
怎样
Well?

153
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,020
你总这么折腾
Your relentless

154
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,790
William 紧盯着你要进展吧
William's breathing down your neck again.

155
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,720
别担心
Don't worry.

156
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,290
我肯定可以在 PROBE 的仓库里找到能点什么
I'm sure we'llfind something in the PROBE store.

157
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,770
你是在找什么时间循环转换器吗？
So you are looking for a time loop converter?

158
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,810
对
Yeah

159
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,650
我有种感觉我们可以找到一个容量足够的(?)
I'm gonna freak we're going to find one of those
with enough capacity to contain the courtfor(??)

160
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,330
库房里面有一个这样的设备
There was such a device in the storage hold.

161
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,930
不是我
It wasn't me.

162
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,260
是我
It was me

163
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,191
- 盒子！ - 是的。你好，Shaw 博士
- Box!  - Yes. Hello, Dr. Shaw.

164
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,620
是你，一个盒子
It's you. In a box

165
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,820
老天，它能用了！
My God, it works!

166
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,770
你把它修好了！
You fixed it!

167
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,700
左边第二区域
Second island on the left.

168
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,820
好主意，盒子
Good thinking, Box

169
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,820
谢谢你
Thank you

170
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,720
Liz?

171
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,770
在这里
In here

172
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:40,250
噢，盒子并不只是会说话啊
Oh box does more than just talking.

173
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,170
对的，盒子并不只是个盒子
Oh yes. Box is more than just a box.

174
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,876
记得这个吗？
Remember this?

175
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,160
我怎么能忘？1995年，对吧
How could I forget? 1995, wasn't it?

176
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,510
把那个女巫救活了？
Bringing that witch back to life?

177
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,180
你确定这个能行？
You sure this will work?

178
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,900
我是说，下士的事是如何能够抑制
I mean, the corporal is about containment

179
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,720
- 正确  - 我没跟你说话
- Positive.  - I wasn't talking to you.

180
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,490
你还有其它的想法？
You have any second thoughts?

181
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,960
这可是政府组织的行刑
This is a government organised execution

182
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,800
我对此觉得很不舒服
and I feel very uncomfortable about it

183
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,645
你好，是 Charlie 吗，Charlie Reynish?
Hello, is that Charlie, Charlie Reynish?

184
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:41,880
你好，请讲
Hello, speaking

185
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,420
我是 Bennett 教授，在国防部工作
I'm Professtor Bennett, from the MOD.

186
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,860
我是你兄弟 Paul 的朋友
And I'm a friend of your brother Paul.

187
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,440
- Paul？ 他已经死了  - 不不，他没死
- Paul? Paul's dead  - No, no, he's not dead.

188
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,720
我没有时间解释，你必须到这里来，马上
I don't have time to explain. You must get here now.

189
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,680
Paul，你已经到了
Paul, you're here ready.

190
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,970
是啊，自己的葬礼可不想迟到，对吧？
Well, wouldn't want to be late for my own funeral, would I?

191
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,470
恐怕，有个人要见见你，Paul
I fear, got somebody to meet you, Paul.

192
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,980
- 下士 7891-阿尔法 - 我知道
- Corporal 7891-Alpha  - I know.

193
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,700
Charlie是你的弟弟，Paul
Charlie's your brother, Paul.

194
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,710
不太像个棺材啊(?)
Not much of a coffin (??)

195
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,080
Johnson少校吧，我估计
Major Johnson, I pursue?

196
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,740
Shaw 博士
Dr. Shaw.

197
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,490
在这里等
Wait here

198
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,940
我们准备好了我会派人来叫你
I'll send somebody to fetch you when we're ready.

199
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,420
Bennett，Shaw博士来了
Bennett, Dr. Shaw is here.

200
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,500
- 你是谁?  - 我是 Charlie
- Who are you?  - I'm Charlie.

201
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,540
- 你在这里做什么？ - 我来带他回家
- What are you doing here? - I'll come to take him home

202
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,980
什么，你什么意思？ 你不能带他回去
What, what would you mean? You cant take him home.

203
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,040
Shaw 博士，这里！
Dr. Shaw. In here!

204
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,740
见鬼这里发生了什么？
What the hell happened in here?

205
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:58,800
我也想知道
Wish I knew.

206
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,050
Bennett，你做了些啥啊？
Bennett, what the hell have you done?

207
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,760
一件我很早之前就该做的事
Something I should have done a long time ago.

208
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,080
Liz.

209
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,530
- 他们会跟踪我们  - 我又不傻
- They will be tracking us  - I'm not stupid

210
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,360
似乎你已经失去了对局面的控制，少校
You seem to have lost control with the situation, Major.

211
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,560
- 你打算怎么做？  - 找到他
- What are you going to do about it?  - Find him

212
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,016
我并不经常给人第二次机会
I don't often give people second chances

213
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:31,810
不过我觉得我可以信任你，少校
but I think I can trust you, Major.

214
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,330
不要让我失望
Don't let me down

215
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,770
明白，都交给我吧
Understood. Leave it with me

216
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,200
- 怎么，Pasty？  - Liz，这里还有些情况
- Yes, Pasty? - Liz, there's something more.

217
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,010
喝吗？
Drink?

218
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,750
不了谢谢
No thanks

219
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,320
记得这个地方吗？
Remember this place?

220
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,770
他们会找到我们的，你知道吗
They're going to find us, you know

221
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,880
没必要再让 PROBE 参与了，你可以回基地去
Theres no need for PROBE anymore.
You can return to base.

222
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,840
不，Pasty，我要留在这里
No, Patsy. I'm staying here.

223
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,190
我们不能让你的情绪牵涉进来，Liz
We can't forge your emotional state
to come into play here, Liz

224
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:29,120
我明白这件事情上你也没有退路了
I understand your back's up against the wall on this one

225
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,240
但你需要我
But you need me

226
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,090
你说得对
You're right

227
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,290
但还是少校主导
But the major is in charge

228
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,750
我听说下士有消息，不过是搞砸了，是吗？
I heard about the corporal,
but of a shambles, don't you think?

229
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,420
所以，让我直说吧，是你把他弟弟扯进来的
So, let me get this straight. You led his brother in.

230
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,010
在当时的情况下这么做是对的
It was the right thing to do under the circumstances

231
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,435
Charlie 有权知道他兄弟还活着
Charlie deserves to know that his brother is still alive.

232
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:55,336
但在目前的情况下，这就是瞎搞
But under the circumstances, this is now a right fuck up

233
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:57,928
- 他们俩一起逃跑了！  - 我并不知道他会带武器
- They're both on the run!  - I didn't know he'd be armed.

234
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,608
更重要的是，少校
More importantly, Major

235
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:02,780
为什么下士被告知他弟弟已经死了？
why was the corporal told that Charlie was dead?

236
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,490
那跟我没关系
That had nothing to do with me.

237
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,060
是我的某位前任，Shaw 博士
It was one of my predecessors, Dr. Shaw

238
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,540
天大的错误，我现在知道了
A big mistake, I can see that now.

239
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,220
好了，别废话了
Okey, enough talk

240
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,500
恕我先告辞，我还得去找到下士的踪迹
Now if you excuse me, I have to find the corporal

241
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,780
我相信你不会挡我的路吧
I trust you won't stand in my way

242
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,290
你可以信任我的，少校
You can trust me, Major.

243
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,500
只要你做的是正确的
If you do the right thing

244
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,640
他们有把枪，老天
They have a gun, for Christ's sake

245
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,678
Bennett， 你让我别无选择
Bennett, you left me no choice.

246
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,120
我得先将你逮捕起来
I'm placing you under arrest

247
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,380
- 我找到车了  - 太好了！
- I found the car. - Excellent!

248
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,670
我这就来
I'm on my way.

249
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,310
这里没怎么变
This doesn't change much.

250
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,990
他们跟我说你得了癌症
They told me you had cancer.

251
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,610
是，这倒是实话
Yeah, that much is true.

252
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,520
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

253
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,600
那，你怎么找到我的？
So, how did you find me?

254
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,610
- 是教授  - Bennett 吗？
- The professor.  - Bennett?

255
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,840
你撒谎...啊！
You're lying...Ah!

256
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,380
我需要我那些药
I need my meds.

257
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,100
准备好了？
Ready?

258
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,090
看到了吧，我不服用药片会怎么样？
See what happens when I don't take my pills?

259
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,650
跟我没喝酒的时候基本一样
You're much the same if I don't have a drink

260
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,460
你想要达到什么目的，？？？
What did you hope to achieve,
storming in old guns blazing?

261
00:23:42,745 --> 00:23:44,660
我没有太多时间了，没法理智
I didn't have much time to be rational.

262
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,000
你想从我这里得到什么？
What do you want from me?

263
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,180
不是这个
Not this.

264
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,390
我曾经失去了你
I lost you once before.

265
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,700
我永远不会原谅我自己
I would never forgive myself.

266
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,510
如果我不能，至少得尝试一下
If I didn't, at least try.

267
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,710
我以为...
I thought...

268
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:04,900
带你来这个地方
by bringing you to this place

269
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,030
我们至少会有五分钟的宁静，免得...
we'd at least have five minutes peace before...

270
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,850
对不起
I'm sorry.

271
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,250
你是我仅有的了
You're all I have.

272
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,440
不
No

273
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,500
该说对不起的是我
It's me who should be sorry

274
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,490
我可以出击了
I'll go in.

275
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,900
视野清晰，长官
I've got clear view, sir.

276
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,020
听我命令
On my command

277
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,974
Shaw 博士，你在干什么？
Dr. Shaw, what are you doing?

278
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:53,070
这有点太极端了吧，少校？
It's a bit extreme, isn't it, Major?

279
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,580
我没得选择
I have no choice.

280
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,860
- 他开始移动了，长官  - 开枪
- He's on the move, sir - Fire

281
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,480
我会同 Bennett 谈的
I'll talk to Bennett.

282
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,644
应该能争取一点时间，然后...
that should buy some time and then...

283
00:25:05,644 --> 00:25:07,980
也许会给你安排一个安全屋
maybe you can put it in a safe house

284
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,650
Charlie!

285
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,030
什么意思，你射偏了？
What do you mean, you missed?

286
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,930
下士怎么样了？
What about the corporal?

287
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,300
- 他在移动，长官  - 狗屎！
- He's on the move, Sir.   - Shit!

288
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,448
Roman, 停手，我们跟进
Roman let it go. We're moving in.

289
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
我们会确保给他一个体面的葬礼
We make sure we give him a decent burial.

290
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,120
是的
Yes

291
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,900
至少这点我们可以做
The least we can do.

292
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,700
长官，这边
Sir, over here.

293
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,880
有个隧道，长官
A tunnel, Sir.

294
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,280
看起来一直通到村子里了，长官
It looks like it goes all the way to the village, Sir

295
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,108
好，你们几个，到这里
Right, you lot, over here.

296
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,590
Haggard wrote like this.(??)

297
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,149
我还以为你已经掌控住了局面
I thought you had this under control

298
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:43,540
逃跑一次就够糟的了，但又来一次？
Escaping once is bad enough, but twice?

299
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,851
这都是什么执行能力？
What kind of operation is running here?

300
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:47,345
看起来像是动画片一样
looks very mickey mouse.

301
00:26:47,345 --> 00:26:51,390
- 我明白你一开始  - 不，我觉得你不明白，Pasty
- I understand your first...
- No, I don't think you do understand Patsy

302
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,750
我正要给首相做汇报
I'm about to brief the prime minister

303
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,872
我还得避而不谈这个话题
I'm going to have to skirt around the fact that

304
00:26:55,936 --> 00:26:58,750
我们搞砸了一个如此简单的任务
we've screwed up such a simple task

305
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,540
我不知道你怎么想，但我还是尽力想保住自己的饭碗的
Don't know about you, but I'm rather keen to keep my job

306
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,470
赶紧找到问题要害，鞭子甩响一点
Now get the grip, crack the whip

307
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,270
咱们别让这个乱局搞得全部里都知道了(??)
let's get this little mess wrapped up minister

308
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,270
你好像挺意外？
You looked surprised

309
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,610
其实并不
Not really

310
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,690
我就知道在这里可以找到你
I expected to find you here.

311
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,210
他们会找到你的，Paul
They'll take you, Paul.

312
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,100
你知道吗？我注意到了
You know what? I'd noticed.

313
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,410
更糟糕的是...
Its worse than that

314
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,630
我的丈夫想要你死
My husband wants you dead

315
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,000
我改变不了什么
Doesn't change anything

316
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,850
但我欠你的
but I owe it to you.

317
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,180
我需要我的药片
I need my meds.

318
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,120
你弄疼我了
You're hurting me

319
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,250
你们找到他了？
Have you found him?

320
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,140
并没有
Not exactly

321
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,960
那你为什么在这里
Why are you here?

322
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,700
我很迷茫
I'm lost.

323
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,050
你怎么找到Charlie 的？
So how did you find Charlie?

324
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,770
家庭的所有详请都在档案记录里
All the family details 're on the records

325
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,280
我以为只是让我们见见面
I thought if they could just meet.

326
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,590
这个就是
So this is it

327
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,770
只够三天的了
Just 3 days left

328
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,240
这就是有名的火星物质
This is a famous martian compound.

329
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,570
没有了这个，下士就死定了
Without this, the corporal is dead

330
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,300
我并不介意告诉你
I don't mind telling you.

331
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,109
对于当前这种无望的局面，我真的很担心
I'm really worried about this hopelessness

332
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:36,490
没时间焦虑了，我们必须把他弄回实验室
Theres no time for anxiety,
we have to get him back to the lab

333
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,490
不用担心我，教授
Don't worry about me, prof.

334
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:40,890
Paul.

335
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,920
你欺骗我！
You lied to me!

336
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,760
没事
It's all right

337
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,000
我是Shaw 博士，Liz
I'm Dr. Shaw, Liz.

338
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,900
你跟我说他已经死了
You told me he was dead

339
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,270
我们必须保护你，这都是为了你好
We had to protect you, it was done in your best interest.

340
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,560
你们杀害了他
You murdered him!

341
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,180
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

342
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,010
把它给我
Give them to me

343
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,650
- 并不在这里！  - 给我药片！
- They're not here.  - Give me the pills!

344
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,440
我这是怎么回事？像烧起来了
What's happening to me? It burns!

345
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,520
你处于一个很不稳定的状态，你需要我们
You are in very volatile state. You need us.

346
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,460
- 这还只是第一阶段  - 最重要是什么，Paul？
- This is only phase 1  - What is vital, Paul?

347
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,620
最重要是你回到实验室，我们可以将你稳定下来
It's vatal we get you back to the lab,
where we can get you stablized.

348
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,480
- 我不相信你！ - 你的身体要崩溃了，就全完了
- I don't trust you!  - Your body is giving up, its over.

349
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:23,910
闭嘴
Shut up

350
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,840
闭嘴，闭嘴
Shut up, shut up

351
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:42,830
- 这么说你也是他们一伙的？  - 不！我只是想帮忙
- So you ARE one of them?  - No! I'm only trying to help

352
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,910
我没想到你会这么生气，很抱歉
I had no idea you'v gone so mad, I'm sorry.

353
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,300
别担心，Shaw 博士
Don't worried, Dr. Shaw.

354
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,640
我的队伍会找到他，对付他
my team will find him and deal with him

355
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,680
不，不要用枪
No, no guns

356
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,730
风险太大
too risky

357
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,510
那...
so,

358
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,230
我们完全不了解，我们在对付的是什么
We have no idea of what were dealing with

359
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,900
正是
Exactly

360
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,500
下士遗留下来一点皮肤
The corporal has left some skin

361
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,140
至少我可以拿去做几个实验
so at least I can run some tests

362
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,030
我回来啦
I'm home.

363
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,090
他仍然在逃
He is still on the run

364
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,290
不过射杀了我们两个人
But he shot two of our men

365
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,170
所以我们把局面控制住了
So we had this under control.

366
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,470
老天啊
Dear god

367
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,160
一小片皮肤就能这样
One piece of skin can do that

368
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:36,690
是的
Yes

369
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,550
所以他就是个倒计时的炸弹
and he's a ticking time bomb

370
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,977
- 你要去哪儿？  - 我必须去重新校正一下椅子
- Where are you going?  - I have to recalibrate the chair.

371
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,780
- 下士那边怎么办？  - 他会来找我们的
- What about the corporal?  - He'll find us

372
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,980
- 那，我们就等着？  - 不会等太久
- So, we wait?  - Not for long.

373
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,390
Liz!

374
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,550
Liz!

375
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,990
糟了
Shit

376
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,110
燃烧瓶？
Molotov cocktail (??)

377
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,040
我还以为这事会很简单
I thought this was gonna be simple

378
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,620
到底要搞多久？
How long can it be?

379
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,140
停下
Stop

380
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,190
别把它收起来
Don't put that away

381
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,370
长官？
Sir

382
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,640
怎么样？
Well?

383
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,780
还没消息
Nothing yet

384
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,620
你们他NND怎么还没找到他？
Why the bloody hell haven't you found him?

385
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,070
Haggard，我就说重点
Look, Haggard. I'll come to the point

386
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,130
你推荐你们 PROBE 的能人来做这事
You show your chunks of PROBE up to this.

387
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,336
但你们真的清楚我们在对付什么吗？
You do realize what were dealing with?

388
00:36:50,432 --> 00:36:53,460
长官，我很清楚目前的情况
I am well aware, sir, of whats at stake

389
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,920
而且我不觉得有任何人比 Shaw 博士更有资格
and I can't think of anyone more qualified than Dr. Shaw.

390
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,240
希望你是对的
I hope you're right.

391
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,820
最后的六小时
for all last 6.

392
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,590
哦，不，糟了
Oh,  no, shit

393
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:28,163
Not to implode (??) function to the elemental array

394
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:28,970
好主意
Good idea.

395
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,520
- 有什么消息  - 我们做了些测试
- Any news? - We run some tests ??

396
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,430
结果呢？
And?

397
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,460
不妙
It's bad.

398
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,390
很不妙
Very bad.

399
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,900
你觉得我做错了，是吧？
You think I made a mistake, don't you?

400
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,300
你把他变成了一头怪兽
You've turned him into a monster.

401
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,810
暴风雨前的宁静
The calm before the storm.

402
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,450
我们准备好了
Now we're ready.

403
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,410
你在哪里？
Where are you?

404
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,560
目标已找到
Target located.

405
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,010
Shaw 博士，你是对的
Dr. Shaw you're right

406
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,210
这个定时炸弹
A ticking time bomb

407
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,270
已经露面了
has gone public

408
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,370
- 准备好面包车 - 是，长官
- Get the van ready - Sir

409
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,400
(Johnson 少校)
(Major Johnson)

410
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,690
少校
Major.

411
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,690
你找到了吗？在哪儿？
You found it? where?

412
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,070
牧羊从？  （位于伦敦西区，临近伦敦富人区肯辛顿区）
Shepherds Bush?

413
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,820
快。好，我们到那里汇合
Quicky. ok, we will meet you there.

414
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,970
我们要去购物了
We're going shopping.

415
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,530
你哪儿也不能去
You're not going anywhere.

416
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,030
如果这事出了纰漏，就由你负责了
If all this goes tits up, you're in charge

417
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,120
你在哪儿，我很好奇
Where are you, I wonder?

418
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,470
糟糕
Shit

419
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,330
我刺探了通讯网络
I meant intercepting of transmission.

420
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:14,336
Johnson 少校刚刚知会了 Haggard
Major Johnson has just informed Haggard

421
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:16,800
说下士有一名女人质
that the corporal has a female hostage.

422
00:42:16,976 --> 00:42:19,300
我们刚才还以为事情不可能进一步恶化了
Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse.

423
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,230
我们只需要确保我们的汇报是全面的
We just need to make sure that we've got a thorough briefing

424
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,992
我猜我们已经找到他了
I presume we found him then

425
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,450
如之前所料，是他找到了我们
As expected, sir, he found us

426
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,340
而且还有点别的情况
and there's something else

427
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,760
So?
什么？

428
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,750
Haggard，说话吞吞吐吐可不像你的风格
Haggard, its not like you to beat around the bush

429
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,880
是 Josie，长官
It's Josie, Sir

430
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,570
各就各位，先生们
Positions, gentlemen

431
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:05,700
动静小点，我们不想惊动平民
Nice and discreet.
We don't want to disturb the natives,

432
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,610
下士也绝不能看见我们
and the corporal must not see us.

433
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:32,870
出去
Out.

434
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,220
马上
Now.

435
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:51,390
- 你他妈的在做什么？  - 把活干完
- What the fuck are you doing? - Finishing the job.

436
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,800
坐下
Sit.

437
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,510
你受伤了
You're hurt.

438
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,700
比你能想到的严重
More than you can imagine.

439
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,770
保持原位别动
Hold your positions.

440
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,950
他把她带去哪里了？
Where'd he taken her?

441
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,340
保安室
Security office.

442
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:32,690
你是对的
You were right.

443
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:34,050
他早计划好了
He has a plan.

444
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,110
他能看到我们的任何动作
He can see everything that we do

445
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,560
好吧
Well

446
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:38,930
那是什么？
What's that?

447
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,640
那是把椅子
That's the chair.

448
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:44,920
它是我们问题的答案，前提是得让他坐上去
Its the answer to all our prayers,
if we can get him to sit in it.

449
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:45,990
长官
Sir.

450
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,590
Williams 太太的号码
Mrs Williams' number

451
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,930
Reasoning of what she said? (??)

452
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,440
祝好运
Good luck.

453
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:02,580
快接
Answer it.

454
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,670
- 你好？  -Williams 太太，你没事吧
- Hello?   - Mrs Williams, are you all right?

455
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,960
 噢，我没事
Oh, I'm fine

456
00:45:13,104 --> 00:45:14,970
下士在那边吧，我要同他通话
Is corporal there now, I need to talk to him

457
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,350
他手里有枪
He has a gun.

458
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,000
是 Johnson 少校，他要同你通话
It's Major Johnson. He wants to talk to you.

459
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,390
- 少校  - 下士
- Major  - Corporal

460
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,782
想从我们这里得到什么就直说吧
Is there anything you need from us?

没，没什么我想要的

- 你确定吗？  - 我说过了，没有

463

你要把 Williams 太太带去哪里？

Williams 太太将会亲眼看到烟花

但我不再是个士兵了，少校

除非你期望你的手上沾上 Josie 的血

- 你不能伤害她  - 你已经听到我说的了

它让我一直保持警醒
It keeps me on my toes.
