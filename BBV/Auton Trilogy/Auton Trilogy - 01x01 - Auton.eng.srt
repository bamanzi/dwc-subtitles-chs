00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Syncro:
F.B Cavalcante

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,500
Just keep the door covered.

3
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:56,140
Janice, have you got a screwdriver?

4
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,040
Hello, Doctor Arnold?

5
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,879
No, Winslet, it's Janice.

6
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,978
Doctor Sal's
a little tied up at the moment.

7
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:48,920
- Tell him not now, Winslet.
- Not now, Winslet.

8
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,900
Wait a minute.

9
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,524
Doctor Arnold specifically asked me
to find any other containers with

10
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,134
the same serial number as the one
that contained that sphere thing.

11
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,729
Said it was very important.

12
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,528
Now I've been doing that
over and above everything

13
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:04,354
else I'm supposed
to be doing down here.

14
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:06,310
I've given it my full attention.

15
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,809
Taken me the best part of two weeks.

16
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,947
And, as a matter of
fact, I have found a

17
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:12,010
large number of crates
with the same code.

18
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,910
- <i>Triple A stroke RH stroke 2961</i>.
- Thank you, Winslet. No time.

19
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,870
Some of them have the letters...

20
00:02:19,698 --> 00:02:23,098
A, U, T O, N.

21
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,271
Winslet, not now.

22
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:28,995
I have a satellite downlink,
an expensive satellite downlink,

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,041
due any...

24
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,829
- Oh God, I'm tired.
- We could always use some of next week's

25
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,569
- satellite window.
- You must be joking.

26
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,789
I'm going to beat
this thing if kills me.

27
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:59,861
- I can't believe you used Meccano.
- Nothing wrong with that.

28
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:01,729
Ah, here we go.

29
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,899
- Anything?
- Still just background radiation.

30
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:21,749
Let's see if I can filter out some
to the extraneous stuff.

31
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:29,478
Ah, nobody loves you.

32
00:03:45,929 --> 00:03:49,029
Janice, get your notepad.

33
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:51,279
Note the time.

34
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:08,509
My God, what have I done?

35
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:53,809
Perhaps we should shut it off now.

36
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:57,659
It's picked up on something.
Or something's picked up on it.

37
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,708
It's having a conversation.

38
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:04,332
It's transmitting.

39
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,248
Terminating the satellite link.

40
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:12,423
That's it.

41
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,481
Janice, keep away!

42
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:52,105
Sincro:
F.B Cavalcante

43
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,411
Doctor Arnold.

44
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:19,469
- Code Seven now on site.
- Protocol one nine zero.

45
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,334
All non-essential
personnel are evacuated

46
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:23,183
to safe house with
full decontamination.

47
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,309
Listen, do you have
any idea what...

48
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:43,309
Heard those nasty rumours
about containment teams?

49
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,400
You don't think.

50
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:11,948
They'll be here any minute now.

51
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:24,172
- Winslet?
- What?

52
00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:29,569
- I'm sorry I said you had bad breath.
- When?

53
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:33,008
When did you have bad breath,
or when did I say it?

54
00:07:33,508 --> 00:07:36,689
- Doesn't matter.
- Don't move!

55
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:02,439
The laboratory's been secured, sir.
If you'd like to come this way.

56
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:20,778
This is where it was.

57
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,430
Dead?
Dead.

58
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,854
Make a preliminary examination.

59
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:46,408
The usual tests.
Open your box of tricks.

60
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:52,438
Did you know her?

61
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,678
Do you think we could
put our hands down now?

62
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,760
Doctor Sally Arnold,
Facility director and head of research?

63
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,340
Pleased to meet you.
May I ask...

64
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,680
- And who is that?
- Winslet. Graham Winslet, archivist.

65
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,601
Non-essential. What are you
doing here, Mister Winslet?

66
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:32,201
- You should have been evacuated.
- I'm afraid I wasn't ready in time.

67
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:35,310
- Oh.
- Sorry.

68
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,910
Sorry.

69
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
All right, lads.

70
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,440
You'd better let them have a general
sniff around, Ramsay.

71
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,371
- Is there a guard on the main entrance?
- Already taken care of.

72
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:58,480
Diligent as always, Ramsay.

73
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,000
I hope you didn't
burn your clothes.

74
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,024
It would be such a waste.

75
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,710
Is this yours, Doctor.

76
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,330
Yes. Useful when
I'm working late.

77
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,730
Which is most nights.

78
00:10:50,124 --> 00:10:52,124
Particle traces on here?

79
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,782
What about the woman?

80
00:10:57,307 --> 00:10:59,244
Massive localised
energy release.

81
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,391
Knocked out her
entire nervous system.

82
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,770
- Did the thing just explode?
- No. If it just exploded, there'd

83
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,881
- be more debris left.
- What are you saying?

84
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:14,341
That it did something a bit
cleverer than just exploding.

85
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:24,651
My name is Lockwood.

86
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:26,875
I am the head
of this containment team.

87
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:28,899
This is a code seven situation,

88
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,930
so your death certificates have
already been prepared by UNIT.

89
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,701
With luck, we won't find it
necessary to issue them.

90
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:38,645
This is Doctor Daniel Matthews,
my assistant.

91
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:42,531
Let me remind you that under the terms of
your contract with UNIT,

92
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:46,411
you're obliged to give me the fullest
cooperation during this investigation.

93
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:51,710
Mister Winslet, perhaps you'd like
to go and put your clothes back on...

94
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,835
and wait in your office.

95
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,231
Right.

96
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,161
Did you think my men were going
to shoot you?

97
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:06,641
At one point, yes,
it did cross my mind.

98
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:09,680
You thought you'd glimpsed
the forbidden fruit,

99
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:12,174
that we were here to stop
the truth getting out.

100
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,950
Something like that.

101
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,860
Perhaps we are here to
stop something getting out.

102
00:12:22,004 --> 00:12:24,004
Was she a friend?

103
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,830
I knew her too.
It was years ago.

104
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,300
She's in shock.

105
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,400
She's no use to me at the moment.

106
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,724
Take care of her,
Doctor Matthews.

107
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,131
I feel stupid.

108
00:13:02,005 --> 00:13:03,280
It's just shock.

109
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,031
Yes.

110
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:11,950
Carry on.

111
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:23,048
You've worked here for
six years, according to your records.

112
00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:27,190
Very fastidious,
not a great socialiser.

113
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,333
Seven years.

114
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:31,182
Seven. Yes.

115
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:34,400
How come you didn't
make it to the safe house?

116
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:38,575
- I told you, I wasn't ready in
- In time. Yes, I know.

117
00:13:39,323 --> 00:13:41,984
- But why weren't you ready in time?
- I don't know.

118
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:45,663
- Not like you.
- How would you know?

119
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:48,334
Not like your personality profile.

120
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:51,466
On the computer at  UNIT HQ.

121
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,420
Geneva.

122
00:13:54,658 --> 00:13:55,570
Been there?

123
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,646
Geneva?

124
00:14:00,058 --> 00:14:00,638
No.

125
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:37,471
I can't believe you used Meccano.

126
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,443
Perhaps we should shut it off now.

127
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,991
- All right?
- Fine. Thanks.

128
00:14:57,891 --> 00:14:59,760
You should finish your tea.

129
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:03,441
It's hot and sweet.
It's good for shock.

130
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,310
How did you know Janice?

131
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,460
Oh, at university.

132
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:11,360
Did you like her?

133
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:15,184
It was a long time ago.

134
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,180
Is your Mister Lockwood always so cold?

135
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:21,545
Lockwood?

136
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,108
He's a breed apart.

137
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,155
But I've worked with  him long
enough to know he's the best there is.

138
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:27,390
I see.

139
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:34,151
Do you have any idea
what's happened here?

140
00:15:35,446 --> 00:15:37,874
-Yes, we have plenty of ideas.
-Like what?

141
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:40,691
Oh, need to know, is it?

142
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:44,251
Why is Lockwood so convinced
there's no contamination risk?

143
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,801
I mean, that thing exploded.
I don't know what was inside it.

144
00:15:47,802 --> 00:15:50,932
If you didn't know what was inside
it, why did you subject it to transmissions

145
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:53,302
from UNIT's most powerful
deep-space scanning satellites?

146
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,199
Because...

147
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:58,416
Because it was the only course
of relevant experimentation left.

148
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:02,685
I'd drawn a blank with the damn thing,
thought it was dead.

149
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:06,296
I tried every test I could think of.

150
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:10,443
That is my job, Doctor Matthews.
Assess and catalogue.

151
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,538
I knew it was of extra-terrestrial origin.

152
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,077
Wasn't just a meteor.
It appeared to be manufactured,

153
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:18,169
so I speculated...

154
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:21,056
- Oh, you speculated.
- Yes.

155
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:24,892
We don't exactly have information
here at our fingertips, I'm afraid.

156
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,597
This place was a sort of forgotten
Aladdin's Cave until about five years ago.

157
00:16:30,565 --> 00:16:33,665
It was a mess.
Mountains of old paperwork.

158
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,178
Winslet hasn't even got a
tenth of the way through it.

159
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:38,202
We're working blind-folded most of.

160
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:43,665
Are you saying you know more about it?

161
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:46,994
Where do you get
your information?

162
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:49,776
I think you're ready
to speak to Lockwood.

163
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:54,972
Are we in danger?

164
00:16:57,011 --> 00:16:58,011
It's possible.

165
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:04,284
So where were you
when it all happened?

166
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:06,403
Storage bay one,
you said just now.

167
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,538
- Yes.
- And you heard the alarm,

168
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:10,478
and you thought I
think I'll just stay

169
00:17:10,503 --> 00:17:12,171
here and pick my
nose, is that it?

170
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:14,237
- No, no.
- Well then, what?

171
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:17,715
Doctor Arnold was
conducting her experiment

172
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,346
in her laboratory on
this alien artefact,

173
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:24,978
serial code triple A stroke RH stroke 2961,

174
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,002
and she asked me to find any other containers

175
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:29,383
- with that code.
- Because she thought there might

176
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:32,333
- be more of them?
- Or anything that would help her identify

177
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:36,023
- what she was dealing with.
- She wasn't dealing with anything,

178
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:38,575
Mister Winslet. She was
tampering with the

179
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,126
unknown, which is always
pretty dangerous.

180
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:44,198
Did you find any other crates with the same
code on them, by the way?

181
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:47,333
- No.
- Greyhound One to Greyhound Leader.

182
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:53,682
-Greyhound Leader.
-We have a problem.

183
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:05,038
- Same as the woman?
- I should say so.

184
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,855
- Mister Lockwood, what is going on?
- Just Lockwood. No Mister.

185
00:18:08,264 --> 00:18:10,121
What is going on?

186
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:13,374
Exits are already secured.

187
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:16,152
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know, exactly.

188
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:18,707
Whatever it is, it can't be very big.

189
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:21,644
- Well, he didn't see it coming.
- Where is it going?

190
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,884
Well, presuming it started here

191
00:18:24,908 --> 00:18:26,011
Oh, let's presume.

192
00:18:26,036 --> 00:18:29,265
- Too many variables give me a headache.
- It's going through the storage bays,

193
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:32,362
whatever it is you're talking about. Look.

194
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:35,616
Well, what are you talking about?

195
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:40,061
Carry on, Ramsay, and see that Doctor
Arnold is kept out of harm's way.

196
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:54,734
What have we got?

197
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,154
We haven't got any of the right
equipment, for a start.

198
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,525
This was a code seven,
contamination risk.

199
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,623
Yes. Bit of a
balls-up, isn't it.

200
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:04,320
I should have twigged
there was no danger

201
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:06,282
of contamination the
moment I saw the code.

202
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:09,353
- Triple A
- RH 2961.

203
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:11,377
Seems no one here knew
what it meant.

204
00:19:12,003 --> 00:19:15,067
But I didn't expect it to turn
into a bug hunt either.

205
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:17,686
- This is something new.
- Should we call for back-up?

206
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:19,580
To pick over our remains.

207
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:23,457
Great sense of
humour, Lockwood.

208
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:25,015
Great.

209
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:29,920
Sorry.

210
00:19:35,771 --> 00:19:38,293
What did he say?
- Who?

211
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:41,606
- This Lockwood.
- Not much.

212
00:19:43,701 --> 00:19:46,785
What do you think of him?
I think he's a bit high-handed.

213
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:57,698
Sorry about Janice.

214
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:09,577
We've got to find a way to track
the damn thing.

215
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:12,292
There's nothing feasible with the
level of equipment we've got here.

216
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:14,792
What is it they say
about a bad workman?

217
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:16,872
Oh, you're calling
me a bad workman.

218
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:20,880
What do you want to do, Dan?

219
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:24,877
Join the search.
See what else has got hidden away here,

220
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:26,187
what it might be after.

221
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:30,900
Our esteemed Doctor Sally Arnold
apparently instructed Mister Personality

222
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:35,675
Winslet to conduct a thorough search
for anything else with the same code.

223
00:20:36,822 --> 00:20:39,894
But would he draw back?
I still thinkit's worth double-checking.

224
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:44,259
I never trusted the brain cell
count in research establishments.

225
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:48,386
All right, Have Ramsay bring Sally
Arnold to her laboratory.

226
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,085
I shall be waiting to give
her my charm offensive.

227
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:58,664
Doctor Arnold?
Come with me, please.

228
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:06,106
- You just sit tight, Mister Winters.
- Winslet. Graham Winslet. Archivist.

229
00:21:06,602 --> 00:21:07,971
Whatever.

230
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:14,162
So he's finally deigned to speak with
me, has he?

231
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:16,424
- Who would that be, Doctor?
- Your boss, Lockwood.

232
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:18,226
I believe he does want a word with
you, yes, Doctor.

233
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,607
I suppose all this is pretty routine
for you, Sergeant.

234
00:21:20,632 --> 00:21:23,543
- That's right, Doctor.
- Where exactly are you taking me?

235
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:26,123
- Your laboratory, Doctor.
- This is the long way.

236
00:21:26,148 --> 00:21:27,630
Come on,
I'll show you a short cut.

237
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:50,029
Do sit down.

238
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,108
What did you make of
these symbols?

239
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:02,370
What did I make of them?
I've never seen anything like them.

240
00:22:02,395 --> 00:22:03,958
All right, all right.

241
00:22:03,982 --> 00:22:07,490
Did you think, oops, dear me,
what have I done?

242
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:11,449
Because I'd like to put to you
that is what you should have been thinking,

243
00:22:11,474 --> 00:22:13,990
given that something is now
crawling around the building

244
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:16,353
apparently with the intention
of wiping out my team.

245
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,671
- Something? What is this something?
-That.

246
00:22:27,451 --> 00:22:30,695
You mean it didn't just
vaporise when it exploded.

247
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:33,693
Doctor Sal is thinking.

248
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:37,004
Doctor Sal, that's what all
your chums call you, isn't it?

249
00:22:37,187 --> 00:22:40,417
The insightful UNIT research scientist?

250
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:42,441
Gifted, highly qualified?

251
00:22:42,787 --> 00:22:46,091
A working class comprehensive
school girl who ended up

252
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:49,576
with degrees in medicine,
physics, chemistry and biology.

253
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,942
I see you've read my file.

254
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:53,283
You're a bit of a maverick in the
scientific community.

255
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:56,871
Not afraid to put forward
new and untested ideas.

256
00:22:56,896 --> 00:23:00,323
I suppose that accounts
for the stupidity of your actions here.

257
00:23:00,348 --> 00:23:04,450
- It's easy to be wise with hindsight.
- Wisdom does not come into it.

258
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,435
Some excrement has hit
the fan, and you, Doctor

259
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,617
Sal, were the idiot who
turned the fan on.

260
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:13,642
I was doing my job.

261
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,999
It's a job which
I happen to consider important.

262
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:18,776
I can't help it if UNIT
doesn't fund us properly.

263
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:21,991
I work with the best information
that I have available to me.

264
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:27,507
In my opinion, underfunding of this
facility makes it a dangerous liability.

265
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:31,153
However, these are not
matters for mere slaves

266
00:23:31,178 --> 00:23:33,880
of the UNIT bureaucracy
like ourselves.

267
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,713
I'm here to pick up the pieces.

268
00:23:39,414 --> 00:23:45,755
I'm your alien artefact
serial code triple A RH 2961.

269
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:49,723
You connect me up to the
widest range of deep-space signals

270
00:23:49,748 --> 00:23:51,568
available to mankind.

271
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,478
Why?

272
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:55,216
Because it hadn't
responded to any other kind of test.

273
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:57,795
God save us from mavericks.

274
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:03,668
You can test a gun all you like, but it doesn't
work until you pull the trigger.

275
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:06,128
You're saying I pulled the trigger?

276
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:11,506
It recognised one of the signals
from out there in deep space.

277
00:24:11,531 --> 00:24:14,517
It came alive
and received instructions.

278
00:24:15,643 --> 00:24:19,239
Now, what kind of an
instruction is please vaporise?

279
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:21,620
Not a very friendly one.

280
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:25,311
And this artefact was
undoubtedly talking to a friend,

281
00:24:25,335 --> 00:24:29,596
so perhaps it was
instructed to do something else.

282
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:46,721
So you're saying it atomised in order

283
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:48,753
to reform itself into
something that could move?

284
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:52,245
And kill.
You saw nothing.

285
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,308
I saw a flash.

286
00:24:54,332 --> 00:24:57,602
I heard Janice and I blacked out.

287
00:24:58,388 --> 00:25:00,697
It's the mobility that's important.

288
00:25:01,218 --> 00:25:03,038
It's going somewhere.

289
00:25:03,697 --> 00:25:05,856
It wants something.

290
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:45,095
That'll be us in the shit, then.

291
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:53,748
Are there any other artefacts in
the warehouse like this one?

292
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:57,809
I don't know. Maybe. I asked Winslet
to look for anything with the same coding.

293
00:25:57,834 --> 00:26:01,063
- Yes, I know.
- You obviously know what it was.

294
00:26:01,462 --> 00:26:04,555
- Is. Yes, I'm afraid I do.
- Well?

295
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,928
It's an energy unit.

296
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:10,547
It's part of the Nestene Consciousness.

297
00:26:11,126 --> 00:26:13,126
It has an affinity for plastic.

298
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:16,447
It's hostile, and God
help us if you have

299
00:26:16,472 --> 00:26:19,925
any more artefacts coded
triple A RH 2961.

300
00:26:37,891 --> 00:26:41,486
- Greyhound Five to Greyhound One.
- Receiving.

301
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:44,343
There's no radio contact with
Greyhound Four.

302
00:26:44,589 --> 00:26:45,931
Winslet's office.

303
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,312
Check it out and report back.

304
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:06,006
Greyhound Leader.

305
00:27:06,346 --> 00:27:08,168
Greyhound Leader, come in.
Please. Over

306
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:09,613
Go ahead, Dan.

307
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:12,883
We've found a crate
coded triple  A RH 2961.

308
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,851
-And it's marked Auton.
-Auton.

309
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,057
- Is that the only one?
- So far.

310
00:27:21,628 --> 00:27:23,002
Has the crate been opened?

311
00:27:23,027 --> 00:27:25,065
- No.
- Any sign of activity?

312
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,090
- No.
- Where are you?

313
00:27:26,422 --> 00:27:28,239
- Storage bay one.
- Keep an eye out for more.

314
00:27:28,264 --> 00:27:30,064
I'm on my way down.
Out.

315
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:33,135
You recognised that word. How?

316
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,674
Auton.

317
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,487
I remember Winslet saying it
over the phone just before.

318
00:27:42,016 --> 00:27:44,185
He'd found some
crates marked Auton.

319
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:47,897
- He told me he didn't find anything.
- I didn't pay much attention at the time,

320
00:27:47,922 --> 00:27:49,501
but I distinctly
remember him saying it.

321
00:27:49,526 --> 00:27:50,988
- Stay here.
- Wait a minute!

322
00:27:53,074 --> 00:27:54,837
What is going on?

323
00:27:54,862 --> 00:27:57,496
- What is Auton?
- It's none of your concern.

324
00:27:57,521 --> 00:28:02,274
Isn't it? I am right in thinking you
blame me for all this, aren't I?

325
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:04,281
Well, if it's my fault,
then I at least think

326
00:28:04,306 --> 00:28:05,919
I have the right to
know what Auton is.

327
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:08,990
Autons are plastic automata

328
00:28:09,093 --> 00:28:12,384
which can be controlled by the
Nestene Consciousness.

329
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:15,965
They're deadly and
virtually indestructible,

330
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:20,171
and it seems you've got
one in your storage bay, Doctor Sal.

331
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:22,274
Storage bay one?
Let's go.

332
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:34,334
Doctor Matthews?

333
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:44,072
Security door.

334
00:29:20,962 --> 00:29:22,774
- Dan?
- Here.

335
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:39,123
I suppose you didn't
know about this, either.

336
00:29:42,021 --> 00:29:45,121
We're probably looking at top-grade
signal shielding here.

337
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,003
How do we get it open?

338
00:29:50,812 --> 00:29:54,333
The question is,
do we want to get it open?

339
00:30:00,376 --> 00:30:01,635
Retina scan lock.

340
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:04,889
It's bound to have your retina print
on its memory.

341
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:07,547
But what about the entry codes?

342
00:30:08,722 --> 00:30:10,920
I don't suppose you have
the code book for this?

343
00:30:10,945 --> 00:30:12,666
I didn't even know it was here.

344
00:30:28,665 --> 00:30:29,797
Can you do it?

345
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,892
We have to know
what we're dealing with.

346
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:43,105
Ramsay, I'd like some of your men here,
just to be on the safe side.

347
00:30:43,353 --> 00:30:45,169
Sir.

348
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:48,105
This is Greyhound One
to Greyhound Six and Seven.

349
00:30:48,328 --> 00:30:49,930
Report to Storage bay one immediately.

350
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:40,517
- Sergeant.
- Defensive positions.

351
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,742
What are you expecting?

352
00:31:48,512 --> 00:31:50,512
You know that danger you were
asking me about earlier?

353
00:32:49,723 --> 00:32:51,572
Keep them peeled, lads.
Keep them peeled.

354
00:33:12,135 --> 00:33:13,135
Another one.

355
00:33:18,753 --> 00:33:20,615
Was the first one just like this?

356
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,322
Identical.
Why?

357
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,218
What's the matter?

358
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,279
I'm not sure.

359
00:33:28,969 --> 00:33:30,853
There's something different.

360
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:33,826
Not quite what I expected.

361
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:37,780
A metamorphosis?

362
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:04,645
The same as before.

363
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:06,207
Something's communicating with it.

364
00:34:07,002 --> 00:34:08,002
The other energy unit.

365
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:22,190
We've got to get out of here.
Now!

366
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:31,945
Take this.

367
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,900
All right, Ramsay.
They're not after a conversation.

368
00:35:13,282 --> 00:35:14,282
Open fire!

369
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,157
We're not going to get
out of this alive, are we?

370
00:36:00,182 --> 00:36:01,308
I'm open to suggestions.

371
00:36:04,322 --> 00:36:06,218
Why not? Let's try it.

372
00:36:06,243 --> 00:36:08,243
- Ramsay?
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

373
00:36:15,828 --> 00:36:16,828
No, this way.

374
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:20,422
No, no, this way.

375
00:36:39,794 --> 00:36:40,794
This way,
Doctor Dan!

376
00:36:46,396 --> 00:36:47,396
Here.

377
00:36:52,101 --> 00:36:53,324
They're jamming us.

378
00:36:53,348 --> 00:36:55,308
-Which way is the exit?
-Over this way.

379
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,566
Poor bastard.

380
00:37:16,955 --> 00:37:17,955
He's still alive.

381
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:21,264
They must have copied him.
That's what they do.

382
00:37:21,963 --> 00:37:23,327
They're using the real Winslet...

383
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:25,073
s a source of information,

384
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,097
like a template.

385
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:28,341
Lockwood tell you this?

386
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:31,501
So they could copy anyone.

387
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,160
We'd never know the difference.

388
00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:37,573
Move it.

389
00:37:54,803 --> 00:37:56,203
This is the only way to the exit.

390
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:57,376
They've got us trapped.

391
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:01,304
And what is this thing?

392
00:38:01,637 --> 00:38:03,566
I don't know, but I've got a good
feeling about it.

393
00:38:04,661 --> 00:38:06,304
Can you get us to your laboratory?

394
00:38:06,645 --> 00:38:08,407
Er, yes.
We can cut through here.

395
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,089
Barricade the door.

396
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,168
Help me with this.

397
00:38:23,503 --> 00:38:25,318
Hold it, hold it.
Couldn't you stop them?

398
00:38:25,343 --> 00:38:26,947
-Not a chance.
-Have they taken the exits?

399
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:27,972
-Yes.
-Shit.

400
00:39:29,229 --> 00:39:30,229
Lockwood...

401
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:33,641
Lockwood!

402
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,590
Just resting my eyes.

403
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:39,355
As your grandmother used to say.

404
00:39:42,407 --> 00:39:43,407
How did you know that?

405
00:39:44,636 --> 00:39:46,617
Your psychoanalysis tests.

406
00:39:47,433 --> 00:39:49,752
We're all on the
great UNIT database.

407
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:53,284
Not even our personalities
is safe from trespass.

408
00:39:53,943 --> 00:39:55,943
Has anyone ever told you you're a very

409
00:39:55,968 --> 00:39:58,244
bitter, cynical,
person, Lockwood?

410
00:39:58,268 --> 00:40:01,101
Don't presume to psychoanalyse me.

411
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:04,441
That's one degree you
don't have, Doctor Sal.

412
00:40:04,465 --> 00:40:05,801
Only my friends call me that.

413
00:40:05,826 --> 00:40:06,826
Then I'll refrain.

414
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,430
What do they want?

415
00:40:41,644 --> 00:40:45,244
I suspect they want what's in that
tank in that sealed chamber.

416
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:47,071
Which is?

417
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,333
Would you take a look at this?

418
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:52,309
There must be some simple
reason why it isn't working.

419
00:40:54,153 --> 00:40:55,603
And in answer to your question,

420
00:40:55,627 --> 00:40:57,944
the thing in the tank is a mystery to me;

421
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:00,762
As yet.

422
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,254
Well, it looks like some
sort of transmitter but...

423
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:26,676
Okay, it's not as bad as it looks.

424
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:28,367
How does it look?

425
00:41:28,629 --> 00:41:30,629
I feel like I've
had a shave with a cheese grater.

426
00:41:30,882 --> 00:41:33,898
Off the wall humour in the face of
excruciating pain?

427
00:41:33,923 --> 00:41:35,803
We'll make a soldier of you yet,
Doctor Dan.

428
00:41:48,677 --> 00:41:49,677
Lockwood.

429
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:56,192
Bloody place is crawling with them.

430
00:41:58,795 --> 00:42:00,120
Do you think Lockwood made it?

431
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:01,526
Yeah.

432
00:42:01,788 --> 00:42:03,255
He's indestructible, isn't he?

433
00:42:05,184 --> 00:42:06,311
What about the others?

434
00:42:07,836 --> 00:42:09,406
Didn't stand a chance.

435
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:14,168
Oh Christ, I think
I'm going into shock.

436
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:24,684
Oh shit...
Ramsay.

437
00:42:25,422 --> 00:42:27,422
How the hell are we
going to get out of this one?

438
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:31,924
Hello?

439
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,676
Whatever this is, it's got a
flat battery,

440
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,105
so I'm recharging it, all right?

441
00:42:38,193 --> 00:42:39,676
Oh for God's sake, Lockwood.

442
00:42:44,669 --> 00:42:45,669
Doctor!

443
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:49,201
Doctor Arnold!

444
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:51,379
Doctor, are you in there?

445
00:42:55,727 --> 00:42:56,858
Doctor Arnold!

446
00:42:56,883 --> 00:42:59,041
Winslet, where the hell have you been?

447
00:42:59,066 --> 00:43:00,708
Hiding, Doctor.

448
00:43:01,128 --> 00:43:02,828
Those dummies.
What is going on?

449
00:43:02,852 --> 00:43:04,453
Everyone out here is dead.

450
00:43:23,511 --> 00:43:24,511
It's me you want.

451
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,169
Kill her and you'll
have to kill me.

452
00:43:27,327 --> 00:43:29,216
You're very perceptive, Lockwood.

453
00:43:29,788 --> 00:43:31,296
Something different about you.

454
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,828
In some ways you're quite like us.

455
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,565
They've captured L
ockwood and that Doctor.

456
00:43:56,487 --> 00:43:58,248
Best you don't move.

457
00:44:00,184 --> 00:44:02,184
Do you know how many
times he's saved my life?

458
00:44:09,641 --> 00:44:11,941
We both know how much pain
he goes through for us.

459
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,403
He wouldn't let us down, would he?

460
00:44:21,836 --> 00:44:23,729
What are you going to do with it
when you've got it?

461
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,745
That sad remnant in there.

462
00:44:27,522 --> 00:44:29,245
Just a bit of slurry, isn't it?

463
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,987
Left-over scrapings
from a body you

464
00:44:32,012 --> 00:44:34,189
tried to create
yourself decades ago.

465
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:36,030
I expect it's got a
bit of mildew...

466
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:38,530
You will open the retina scan door.

467
00:44:39,664 --> 00:44:40,708
Wel...

468
00:44:41,406 --> 00:44:43,783
Don't you wish you'd been
a little more pleasant to me?

469
00:44:43,808 --> 00:44:44,808
What?

470
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:48,069
If I don't help him, he's probably
going to kill you.

471
00:44:49,481 --> 00:44:53,108
Right?
I can't say I really care.

472
00:44:54,343 --> 00:44:56,005
Of course, then he'll kill me.

473
00:44:57,854 --> 00:44:59,299
Then what will you do?

474
00:45:00,275 --> 00:45:02,751
Cut my head off and
use my retina print?

475
00:45:03,624 --> 00:45:05,198
You still won't
have the code.

476
00:45:23,217 --> 00:45:24,674
You are like us.

477
00:45:25,372 --> 00:45:29,079
You're linked to something.

478
00:45:32,073 --> 00:45:33,073
What does he mean?

479
00:45:35,138 --> 00:45:38,560
You should be attending to your
battery charger...

480
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:41,694
Doctor Sal.

481
00:45:56,582 --> 00:45:58,639
- Come with me.
- We're not leaving him.

482
00:45:58,664 --> 00:46:00,107
Yes, you are,
if you want to save him.

483
00:46:04,872 --> 00:46:06,572
Leave them.
They're unimportant.

484
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:39,641
My God, it works.

485
00:46:40,934 --> 00:46:42,103
What the hell is that?

486
00:46:42,463 --> 00:46:43,928
I've got no idea.

487
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:55,579
Lockwood...

488
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:58,299
UNIT's creature.

489
00:48:17,796 --> 00:48:19,133
You cannot resist us.

490
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:23,216
You can fight,
but you can't win.

491
00:48:23,823 --> 00:48:24,823
Soon.

492
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:28,049
Soon all the chaos
will be over...

493
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:30,430
and you'll be at one...

494
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:32,905
with us.

495
00:48:41,153 --> 00:48:42,153
Marvellous.

496
00:48:42,177 --> 00:48:44,177
The return of the maverick.

497
00:48:44,574 --> 00:48:45,574
Who the...

498
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:47,716
what the hell are you?

499
00:48:48,414 --> 00:48:50,314
Think how many
people you've killed.

500
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:51,438
Why'd you do it?

501
00:48:51,923 --> 00:48:53,335
Because that's what we do.

502
00:49:31,074 --> 00:49:32,074
Don't do it.

503
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:33,507
Don't go in there.

504
00:49:33,531 --> 00:49:34,935
It's too dangerous.

505
00:49:34,959 --> 00:49:36,562
Just keep the door covered.

506
00:49:36,638 --> 00:49:37,638
We'll lock it...

507
00:49:37,979 --> 00:49:40,015
Get the experts
to deal with this thing.

508
00:49:40,951 --> 00:49:43,665
Maybe find out some
of its weaknesses for next time.

509
00:49:43,788 --> 00:49:44,788
Next time?

510
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,642
They've tried before.

511
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:48,348
They'll try...

512
00:50:07,669 --> 00:50:09,060
My God.

513
00:50:24,462 --> 00:50:25,462
Bloody hell.

514
00:50:26,759 --> 00:50:28,048
Where does that lead?

515
00:50:28,547 --> 00:50:30,015
Straight to the surface.

516
00:50:35,114 --> 00:50:36,364
Call for back-up.

517
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:41,216
Greyhound One.

518
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:53,665
Not a bad bit of workmanship,

519
00:50:54,293 --> 00:50:55,769
Doctor John Smith.

520
00:50:59,602 --> 00:51:01,602
Just returned from
the outlying area, sir.

521
00:51:02,487 --> 00:51:03,487
How far did you go?

522
00:51:03,646 --> 00:51:05,723
We estimated a fifty mile radius.

523
00:51:05,747 --> 00:51:06,915
Moorland, mainly.

524
00:51:07,137 --> 00:51:09,137
A few farmhouses,
cottages, and suchlike.

525
00:51:09,888 --> 00:51:10,888
Nothing?

526
00:51:11,008 --> 00:51:12,008
Not a trace.

527
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:15,179
You've done a good job, Ramsay.

528
00:51:15,421 --> 00:51:16,721
- I can ask for no more.

529
00:51:17,459 --> 00:51:18,898
-Pack up and go.
-Sir.

530
00:51:22,851 --> 00:51:24,136
See you back at base, sir.

531
00:51:26,023 --> 00:51:27,023
You're a good chap, Ramsay.

532
00:51:28,096 --> 00:51:31,636
I used to think your sort only
existed in black and white war films.

533
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,710
Always salutes when he can't think
of anything to say...

534
00:51:42,992 --> 00:51:43,992
Have you noticed?

535
00:51:46,476 --> 00:51:47,666
How's your face?

536
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:50,920
It's a life-enriching experience.

537
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:58,341
We found particle traces of the
Nestene creature in the external air vents.

538
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:01,353
It's out there somewhere.

539
00:52:10,721 --> 00:52:12,421
Put it in the bin, Sal.

540
00:52:19,905 --> 00:52:22,239
Memories can eat away at you,
if you let them.

541
00:52:23,563 --> 00:52:25,096
Come to escort me to my debriefing?

542
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:26,675
- Yes.

543
00:52:26,857 --> 00:52:28,857
I also came to thank you.

544
00:52:29,237 --> 00:52:31,476
Thank me for being the
idiot who threw excrement

545
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:33,374
at the fan, or whatever
it was you said?

546
00:52:33,508 --> 00:52:35,008
For being insightful...

547
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:37,190
gifted, a bit of a maverick.

548
00:52:38,397 --> 00:52:40,850
You saved my life, Doctor Sal.

549
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:48,985
I think I'm going to
enjoy working with you.

550
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:51,405
- Working?
- Yes.

551
00:52:52,183 --> 00:52:55,308
High-handed of me, I know,
but I've had you reassigned...

552
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:57,451
to my team.

553
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,626
I'm not sure I know
what to think about that.

554
00:53:01,515 --> 00:53:02,848
You're saying I have no choice.

555
00:53:04,419 --> 00:53:05,666
Wretched, isn't it?

556
00:53:06,762 --> 00:53:08,324
I don't think  I'm ready
for your kind of work.

557
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:09,833
Why not?

558
00:53:12,038 --> 00:53:14,515
I caused everything
that happened here.

559
00:53:14,952 --> 00:53:16,690
- I killed all those people...
- It was out there...

560
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:18,118
waiting to happen.

561
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:19,690
You made a mistake.

562
00:53:21,486 --> 00:53:22,692
We all do that.

563
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:24,468
A mistake?

564
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:25,661
Yes.

565
00:53:26,716 --> 00:53:28,317
We can never
know the future...

566
00:53:29,134 --> 00:53:31,372
but we mustn't
let the past haunt us.
