1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Syncro:
F.B Cavalcante

2
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:11,833
Look at me, Lockwood.
Look at me.

3
00:00:12,756 --> 00:00:15,613
Giant octopuses don't just
vanish into thin air.

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,701
So you're some kind 
of expert, are you?

5
00:00:19,057 --> 00:00:20,987
You can't turn your 
back on what you've done.

6
00:00:21,113 --> 00:00:22,554
 You have to tell me the truth.

7
00:00:23,112 --> 00:00:25,137
-You don't understand.
-Try me.

8
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:39,406
No, I don't feel in control.

9
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:42,271
I feel old.

10
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:46,753
-You're not safe here.
-I'm not safe anywhere.

11
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:49,105
-Shall we go back, then?
-Natasha.

12
00:00:49,135 --> 00:00:51,842
Whatever happened 
on Sentinel Island isn't over.

13
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:55,065
You're part of it now, Lockwood.
It's part of you.

14
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,261
It's for that very 
reason I can't go back.

15
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:02,802
How long do you think my head would
stay connected to the rest of my body?

16
00:01:02,827 --> 00:01:05,508
-But UNIT wouldn't...
-There are fairies at the bottom

17
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,720
of my garden too.

18
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:11,155
You're right.

19
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:14,568
I tried to contain that thing...

20
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:16,834
Here.

21
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:19,933
But all I did was give it a route back.

22
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:22,502
All the more reason why 
you should come with me.

23
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:24,909
I've made a terrible mistake.

24
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:26,768
Lockwood?

25
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:14,853
Mister Winslet.

26
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,496
Mister Winslet?

27
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:19,939
 Graham?

28
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:24,450
What are we doing out here
in our jim-jams again?

29
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,590
Come along.

30
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:09,679
No.

31
00:03:12,162 --> 00:03:12,948
No.

32
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,050
It's coming back.

33
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,230
It's coming back for me.

34
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:20,983
No.

35
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:22,655
No.

36
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,042
Thank you, Dalby.

37
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:09,009
Sit down, Doctor Arnold.

38
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,897
My name is Palmer.

39
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,223
You are in my custody now.

40
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:20,618
A lot's been happening,
Doctor Arnold.

41
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:21,421
 Catch up.

42
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:24,486
New York Stock Exchange, 
all systems wiped.

43
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,093
 NASDAQ's in free-fall.

44
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:30,678
Aeroflot flight 496 fell out of the
sky over Berlin,  computer malfunction.

45
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:34,027
Perth Australia, sixteen
patients in intensive care,

46
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:37,723
their respirators just happened
to turn themselves off at the same time.

47
00:04:38,354 --> 00:04:39,563
Just what does this 
have to do with me?

48
00:04:39,953 --> 00:04:43,442
It started when Lockwood 
left Sentinel Island...

49
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:46,586
And it hasn't stopped.

50
00:04:47,894 --> 00:04:48,922
In fact, it's getting worse.

51
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:51,097
By the middle of next week 
there won't be a computer left on

52
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:52,922
the planet that 
hasn't malfunctioned.

53
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:57,190
And that doesn't even scratch the
surface of what's happening at Millhampton.

54
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:02,314
Are we smelling the coffee yet,
Doctor Arnold?

55
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:04,706
Look what I found.

56
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,976
I thought it was
best to let you sleep.

57
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:09,793
Yeah, sleep.

58
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:11,217
Dreams.

59
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:13,174
No, thank you.

60
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:16,815
I've got enough rubbish inside 
me as it is without adding to it.

61
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:18,629
It's out of you now.

62
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:22,149
Let's take stock, shall we?

63
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:25,419
An ancient elemental force...

64
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,285
Buried deep 
below the surface...

65
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:30,467
Waiting for a signal to re-emerge.

66
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:34,038
A paranoid and secretive...

67
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,273
Governmental paramilitary team...

68
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:38,304
Desperate to get 
its hands on me...

69
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:39,235
Well...

70
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:41,097
What's inside me,

71
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:42,352
 before the enemy does.

72
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:44,399
How am I doing so far?

73
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,875
UNIT, the Nestenes, 
I bet you never felt so popular.

74
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:56,490
Someone cut through the wrong cable
at the psychic exchange?

75
00:05:57,636 --> 00:05:59,260
Try something a little  more...

76
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:00,276
Conventional.

77
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:03,188
No, wait.

78
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:05,460
There is something.

79
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:09,299
Friends.

80
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,309
Lockwood left the door 
open for them, Doctor Arnold.

81
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:17,015
Just when was it you 
realised he'd changed sides?

82
00:06:19,436 --> 00:06:22,080
Just before I was 
dragged off by the ISD.

83
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,560
You need me.

84
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:32,099
Why should I help you,

85
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:34,285
when I've been wired up 
in that dungeon of delights,

86
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:38,448
-interrogated for three weeks solid?
-You're a close associate of Lockwood's.

87
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:41,250
Now, the question is...

88
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,585
Just how close?

89
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:45,606
What do you want from me?

90
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:54,613
When we last met...

91
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:57,334
a seed was planted in your mind.

92
00:06:58,715 --> 00:06:59,292
Your very...

93
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:02,231
Very special mind Lockwood.

94
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:04,578
You're too kind.

95
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:06,886
It's been...

96
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,299
Germinating.

97
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,894
Why are you investigating Lockwood?

98
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:15,884
He's UNIT's best operative.

99
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,225
We're investigating 
him because his...

100
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,084
Special abilities...

101
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,695
Are a two-way street.

102
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:25,017
He may have permanent access...

103
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,948
To the sum total
of UNIT's acquired wisdom...

104
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:29,032
Through a pieceof 
hardware in his brain,

105
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:31,926
but that means someone, 
somewhere in this great

106
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,276
organisation is watching 
over his every thought.

107
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:40,903
Now listen to me,
you stubborn old bastard.

108
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:44,458
Don't let that smooth-talking piece 
of plastic let you wallow in self-pity.

109
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,401
Look into my mind.

110
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:48,908
I know what it's like to be the outsider...

111
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:51,140
But we make ourselves outsiders.

112
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,410
The trick is to let people in.

113
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:55,435
 Lockwood, I'm letting you in.

114
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:00,871
Where did that creature go?

115
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:03,812
It hasn't gone, has it.

116
00:08:03,836 --> 00:08:05,089
Lockwood, what have you done?

117
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,000
Whose side are you on?

118
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,783
So you're psychic too.

119
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,646
You read Natasha's mind.

120
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,429
What did she mean?

121
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,499
From what you're showing me,
 Lockwood destroyed the thing.

122
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:27,067
Not destroyed, absorbed.

123
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:29,305
Into his mind?

124
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,046
Pure mental energy.

125
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,427
So what happened in Millhampton,

126
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:34,647
-when they got back to the mainland?
-We don't know.

127
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:38,574
You've lost contact with Natasha.

128
00:08:40,137 --> 00:08:41,001
And Lockwood.

129
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:42,422
You...

130
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:44,010
Care for him.

131
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:48,918
Yes.

132
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:50,267
Then help me.

133
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:53,857
Millhampton hospital.

134
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:56,284
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

135
00:08:57,522 --> 00:08:58,237
They're here.

136
00:08:58,798 --> 00:08:59,428
-Ramsay?

137
00:08:59,817 --> 00:09:01,817
-The team?
-No.

138
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:04,448
Them.

139
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:09,209
The psychiatric unit.

140
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,210
Of course.

141
00:09:12,282 --> 00:09:14,901
This is where we sent the 
real Winslet to recuperate.

142
00:09:16,638 --> 00:09:17,737
Clever bastards.

143
00:09:27,821 --> 00:09:29,880
Even you, Miss Alexander?

144
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,030
No one else could have kept
me as effectively hidden

145
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:37,953
from UNIT and be reeled
in without even noticing.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,010
I was always the last 
boy picked at games.

147
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:48,893
Nothing changes.

148
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:55,935
If I can't get out...

149
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:58,068
Then I'm not going to let you in!

150
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:05,458
Time to sleep.

151
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,163
To sleep.

152
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:12,616
To dream.

153
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:22,122
Transmission cut out.

154
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:22,918
Damn it.

155
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:25,254
What did Palmer have to say,
anything useful?

156
00:11:25,491 --> 00:11:27,874
Only the air content was normal on
the west side of the town.

157
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:23,217
Run for it!

158
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:40,403
Open fire.

159
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:03,964
Not quite what I expected.

160
00:14:05,035 --> 00:14:07,035
Nice to know all my 
research paid off, though.

161
00:14:15,544 --> 00:14:17,968
-Come on, Sal.
-Just a minute. Power surge.

162
00:14:38,353 --> 00:14:39,913
Greyhound One to 
Greyhound Leader.

163
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,548
Palmer, it's Ramsay.

164
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,249
We need rein...

165
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,362
Looks like they've 
cranked up the power.

166
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:39,188
Run for it...
Run for it, Sal!

167
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,910
Natasha?

168
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:23,595
 Ah, more dreams.

169
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,231
Amazing what 
goes on in the mind...

170
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:30,860
At the point of death.

171
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:36,062
Lockwood, wake up.

172
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:37,522
We've got to get out of here.

173
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:49,053
You don't remember 
what happened.

174
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:54,804
Lockwood, please.

175
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:56,864
You can't distract me.

176
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:58,419
You're only a dream.

177
00:17:01,914 --> 00:17:04,070
I wonder who else 
I shall dream about?

178
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:22,121
Oh, Palmer. 
Have you seen Ramsay?

179
00:17:24,408 --> 00:17:25,620
What about the rest of your team?

180
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,326
Oh, running behind
schedule, are we?

181
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,395
Got to find Lockwood.

182
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,035
That's what we're
here for, isn't it?

183
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,623
Look, you asked 
me to help you...

184
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:38,804
We must find Lockwood.

185
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,330
The others have arrived.

186
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,255
I knew he'd come.

187
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:03,758
You have a connection with him.

188
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:10,810
He reads your thoughts.

189
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:24,615
Are you sensing something?

190
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,778
Natasha?

191
00:18:28,778 --> 00:18:31,631
Maybe you're not tuning into her, 
but she's tuning in to you.

192
00:18:55,724 --> 00:18:56,994
Lockwood.

193
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,131
More dreams... 
Only dreams...

194
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,357
Lockwood.

195
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:15,014
You know you can't resist us.

196
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:22,554
Your breath smells, 
Mister Winslet.

197
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:27,094
Like rubber.

198
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:37,306
You are like us.

199
00:19:42,592 --> 00:19:44,636
Linked to a greater intelligence...

200
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:46,081
And yet...

201
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,136
Part of it.

202
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:49,988
You rely on it...

203
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,233
It is part of you.

204
00:19:53,632 --> 00:19:55,333
You communicate with it.

205
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,217
You can't shut it out, Lockwood.

206
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:00,341
If you want the implant,

207
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,883
you could always crack 
my skull open and cut it out.

208
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,105
But then it wouldn't be of any
use to you, would it?

209
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:12,925
Needs a mind...

210
00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:15,119
To operate it.

211
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:17,976
Sorry, old chap.

212
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:19,127
Nice try.

213
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:22,420
Any chance of a cup of tea?

214
00:20:24,428 --> 00:20:26,064
Soon, Lockwood.

215
00:20:28,223 --> 00:20:28,825
Soon.

216
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:57,949
Greyhound One to base.

217
00:21:58,544 --> 00:21:59,997
Greyhound One to base. Over.

218
00:22:04,343 --> 00:22:05,683
Do you think it's the same creature?

219
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:06,818
The one from Sentinel Island?

220
00:22:07,755 --> 00:22:08,735
Possibly.

221
00:22:11,817 --> 00:22:14,055
There's more of those creatures
on the planet, you know.

222
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:18,260
These sites have always been feared...

223
00:22:18,492 --> 00:22:20,741
Revered and worshipped.

224
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:24,589
Ancient sites linked by ley lines,
like the one on Sentinel Island.

225
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:26,944
And this is another one, 
is that what you're saying?

226
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:28,038
Perhaps.

227
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:19,737
How are your psychic powers, 
Mister Palmer?

228
00:23:20,435 --> 00:23:22,539
Have you sensed anything 
yet from your protégé,

229
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,404
-Natasha Alexander the Great?
-I'm waiting.

230
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,490
What for, reinforcements?

231
00:23:31,365 --> 00:23:33,535
We should have brought a 
bigger team with us in the first place.

232
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:34,961
Do you think that would have made
any difference?

233
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:36,129
We're still alive, 
aren't we?

234
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:38,950
-Yes, we are.
-So is Natasha, isn't she?

235
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,379
I think so.

236
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,419
Anyone receiving? Over.

237
00:23:43,444 --> 00:23:43,896
Hello.

238
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:47,884
This is Greyhound Leader. 
Come in. Over.

239
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,957
Palmer! Palmer, 
is that you?

240
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,877
Ramsay!

241
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,251
This is Greyhound One.

242
00:23:53,536 --> 00:23:55,277
Anyone receiving? Over.

243
00:23:55,646 --> 00:23:56,726
Ramsay!

244
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:00,972
Sal. Doctor Sal.

245
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:03,954
 Bit of a maverick.

246
00:24:05,347 --> 00:24:08,019
This is Greyhound Leader. 
Come in. Over.

247
00:24:08,557 --> 00:24:09,608
This other chap.

248
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,912
-Now who's he?
-Yes.

249
00:24:13,681 --> 00:24:14,698
 Who?

250
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,031
No.

251
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:19,424
I think a little mystery is healthy...

252
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:21,984
Don't you,
Mister Winslet?

253
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:23,904
This is Sal. Can you hear me?

254
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,389
-Sal, is that you?
-Yes, yes, it's me.

255
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:28,506
Oh God, James, 
I thought you were dead.

256
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:29,312
Where are you?

257
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:30,912
Listen, there's a kind...

258
00:24:31,047 --> 00:24:32,163
Of energy barrier.

259
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,209
I think they've cut off the entire town.

260
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:35,485
We can't get out.

261
00:24:37,472 --> 00:24:39,534
I've come back as far as the hospital.

262
00:24:40,232 --> 00:24:42,232
There's a lot of Auton activity here.

263
00:24:42,396 --> 00:24:43,551
I'm going to take a look...

264
00:24:43,614 --> 00:24:44,831
find out what
they're up to.

265
00:24:45,115 --> 00:24:46,609
Quite a lot...

266
00:24:46,982 --> 00:24:47,998
Mister Ramsay.

267
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,235
Where exactly is it, James?

268
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:55,449
Can you give us your position 
so we can get to you? Over.

269
00:24:55,635 --> 00:24:57,441
North west of the city centre.

270
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:58,615
On the outskirts.

271
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:01,562
Sal?

272
00:25:02,443 --> 00:25:03,999
Sal, come in. Over!

273
00:25:13,075 --> 00:25:15,075
How do you find 
Your dream now...

274
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,633
 Lockwood?

275
00:25:22,122 --> 00:25:22,675
Good.

276
00:25:45,505 --> 00:25:48,613
You're trying so very hard, 
aren't you, Lockwood?

277
00:25:52,112 --> 00:25:53,217
But for what?

278
00:25:54,749 --> 00:25:58,343
The miserable speck of 
cosmic dust you call home?

279
00:26:00,264 --> 00:26:01,115
No.

280
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:03,162
No, I don't think so.

281
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:05,249
For pride...

282
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:08,925
Medals, pats on the back 
from your worthless superiors?

283
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,105
No.

284
00:26:13,153 --> 00:26:14,452
No, that's not your...

285
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:16,333
Style!

286
00:26:23,612 --> 00:26:25,085
I'll huff...

287
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:26,879
And I'll puff...

288
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,670
And I'll blow...

289
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:30,979
Your house...

290
00:26:33,874 --> 00:26:34,443
In.

291
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,387
Granny...

292
00:26:38,713 --> 00:26:42,715
what trite cultural
references you have.

293
00:26:45,513 --> 00:26:48,107
Never were any good at
being human...

294
00:26:49,972 --> 00:26:50,726
Were you?

295
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,398
The form suffices...

296
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:03,582
But it is...

297
00:27:03,979 --> 00:27:05,018
Constraining.

298
00:27:08,152 --> 00:27:09,901
It never fails to surprise me...

299
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,887
How humans can live in 
something so...

300
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:16,956
Obsolete...

301
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:18,129
And...

302
00:27:19,462 --> 00:27:20,645
Small.

303
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:23,816
The form suffices.

304
00:27:24,524 --> 00:27:26,438
You are an insect, Lockwood.

305
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:29,631
You think your existence will make one iota

306
00:27:29,656 --> 00:27:32,477
of difference to our 
colonisation of this world,

307
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:36,104
when we have waited 
a thousand million years...

308
00:27:36,152 --> 00:27:39,756
Seen the suns of million 
systems grow old and die,

309
00:27:39,787 --> 00:27:41,987
watched life crawl from the slime

310
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:44,790
and stand on its hind 
legs on a trillion worlds?

311
00:27:44,815 --> 00:27:48,177
We are time, Lockwood...

312
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:58,857
And you...

313
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,861
Are but...

314
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,054
A nano-second...

315
00:28:07,815 --> 00:28:09,114
In the history...

316
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:10,511
Of my...

317
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:12,023
Species.

318
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:28,232
Dream away, Lockwood.

319
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,094
Dream away.

320
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,090
Dawn...

321
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,208
A new dawn...

322
00:28:42,358 --> 00:28:44,002
Will soon be here.

323
00:30:13,632 --> 00:30:14,367
Natasha?

324
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:26,233
Sergeant Ramsay, isn't it?

325
00:30:28,566 --> 00:30:29,566
What happened to you?

326
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:32,947
Sentinel Island...

327
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:34,995
The church...

328
00:30:37,106 --> 00:30:38,673
We got back to the mainland.

329
00:30:39,535 --> 00:30:41,117
Is Lockwood still alive?

330
00:30:41,196 --> 00:30:43,249
Yes, I think so.

331
00:30:48,303 --> 00:30:49,391
You think I'm an Auton.

332
00:30:52,654 --> 00:30:53,747
Would you know if you were?

333
00:30:55,065 --> 00:30:56,001
Would you tell me?

334
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:00,825
Does that think work on humans?

335
00:31:07,393 --> 00:31:08,393
Well, let's find out.

336
00:31:21,805 --> 00:31:22,805
You all right?

337
00:31:26,242 --> 00:31:27,002
I'm fine.

338
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:35,583
So what does that prove?

339
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:36,941
I don't know.

340
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:39,335
It shouldn't have affected you.

341
00:31:40,614 --> 00:31:41,614
But it did, didn't it?

342
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:48,258
It's what, head north west?

343
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:53,284
Not exactly hurrying, are they?

344
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,545
Just gently nudging 
us in the right direction.

345
00:32:20,582 --> 00:32:21,582
Now...

346
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:23,053
Natasha...

347
00:32:25,687 --> 00:32:27,687
Bring Ramsay to us.

348
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,211
What the hell are you doing?

349
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,409
Well done. 
Well.

350
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,531
Please don't struggle, Natasha.

351
00:34:22,284 --> 00:34:24,284
Stay with us.

352
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:46,574
What is it?

353
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:48,167
It's Natasha.

354
00:34:49,436 --> 00:34:50,816
She's with them.

355
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,166
Not exactly.

356
00:34:53,483 --> 00:34:54,025
Voices.

357
00:34:54,715 --> 00:34:56,339
-Thousands of voices.
-What do you mean?

358
00:34:58,185 --> 00:35:00,031
The town, the people.

359
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:01,499
All of them.

360
00:35:02,746 --> 00:35:03,845
Anguish,

361
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:05,226
Pain.

362
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:08,289
Break the link with 
Natasha. Break it!

363
00:35:08,621 --> 00:35:09,079
No.

364
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:11,102
You stupid bastard, don't you see?

365
00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:13,839
They've got to you through 
your psychic link with Natasha.

366
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:16,334
You're just like Lockwood.

367
00:35:16,421 --> 00:35:17,810
You've sold out 
without knowing it.

368
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:19,961
They must have 
Twanted you to come here.

369
00:35:20,881 --> 00:35:22,262
That's why I'm here.

370
00:35:24,547 --> 00:35:25,192
What?

371
00:35:26,343 --> 00:35:27,827
You knew this was 
going to be a trap?

372
00:35:27,852 --> 00:35:29,881
You'd rather I'd authorise
strategic nuclear

373
00:35:29,906 --> 00:35:31,663
action and wipe this
city off the map?

374
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:33,565
Do you honestly think 
that would have worked?

375
00:35:33,826 --> 00:35:35,472
And what about Lockwood?

376
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:36,639
What about Natasha?

377
00:35:37,631 --> 00:35:39,267
Maybe they were relying on your...

378
00:35:39,454 --> 00:35:40,735
Connection with her?

379
00:35:40,784 --> 00:35:43,467
And through Lockwood to 
every computer network in the world.

380
00:35:44,673 --> 00:35:46,762
You finally see the bigger picture.

381
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,650
Why do I suddenly feel like a small
piece on a very big chess board?

382
00:35:53,355 --> 00:35:54,310
Natasha?

383
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,743
You're back.

384
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,655
What happened to Ramsay?

385
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:03,258
Ramsay, Sal, Palmer, 
they're coming to see you.

386
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:03,913
Sal?

387
00:36:05,072 --> 00:36:05,610
Palmer?

388
00:36:08,825 --> 00:36:10,825
I mustn't ask questions.

389
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:12,925
I'm dreaming...

390
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:15,426
And I must never...

391
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:16,418
Wake up.

392
00:36:17,078 --> 00:36:18,747
We all have to wake up sometime.

393
00:36:19,365 --> 00:36:21,319
You're only human 
after all, Lockwood.

394
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:23,058
Special, perhaps...

395
00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:25,958
With alien technology 
embedded in your mind...

396
00:36:26,624 --> 00:36:28,715
Giving you access to so much knowledge...

397
00:36:29,913 --> 00:36:31,131
But you're still only human.

398
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,185
I've always felt a bit of a non-starter...

399
00:36:36,169 --> 00:36:37,399
In the human race.

400
00:36:40,672 --> 00:36:43,392
It's only a matter of time.

401
00:36:44,884 --> 00:36:46,140
I can see them.

402
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,003
-No.
-Friends.

403
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:51,177
 I knew he'd come.

404
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,041
Get out!

405
00:37:02,515 --> 00:37:03,828
 I'm driving!

406
00:37:05,453 --> 00:37:08,080
-No, you don't understand.
-It's a trap, James.

407
00:37:08,331 --> 00:37:09,450
He's known all along.

408
00:37:09,612 --> 00:37:11,085
He's led us into a bloody trap.

409
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,770
Get in. 
Get in!

410
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:18,960
I've had enough of
this psychic crap.

411
00:37:33,613 --> 00:37:34,455
The Autons.

412
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:40,155
Bastard. 
You sold us out.

413
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:42,721
It's the hospital.

414
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:44,960
We've got to go there.

415
00:37:45,025 --> 00:37:46,278
Are you absolutely sure?

416
00:37:46,608 --> 00:37:47,209
Yes.

417
00:37:52,023 --> 00:37:52,934
Too late.

418
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:53,974
They're going to kill us.

419
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:55,139
No...

420
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,126
I don't think they are.

421
00:37:57,674 --> 00:37:58,915
Shut up.

422
00:37:59,108 --> 00:37:59,702
Listen...

423
00:37:59,726 --> 00:38:02,131
They've had plenty of 
opportunities already.

424
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:05,953
They could have finished us off a
half a dozen time by now,

425
00:38:05,978 --> 00:38:07,282
but they haven't, have they.

426
00:38:07,798 --> 00:38:09,028
Well, don't you see?

427
00:38:11,218 --> 00:38:11,973
Well, look.

428
00:38:12,316 --> 00:38:13,316
Look at them.

429
00:38:15,736 --> 00:38:17,196
They can't do it.

430
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:18,955
They can't kill us.

431
00:38:19,748 --> 00:38:21,203
What the hell gives you that idea?

432
00:38:21,576 --> 00:38:22,989
They tried to kill me, didn't they?

433
00:38:23,228 --> 00:38:24,338
No, wait, James, he's right.

434
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:25,743
They have stopped.

435
00:38:26,498 --> 00:38:28,766
It's because they need us alive.

436
00:38:29,012 --> 00:38:30,020
They must do.

437
00:38:30,943 --> 00:38:31,602
But why?

438
00:38:31,991 --> 00:38:33,224
What's so special about us?

439
00:38:33,248 --> 00:38:35,982
If we've any chance 
whatsoever of stopping them...

440
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:39,130
that's exactly what we've got
to find out, isn't it?

441
00:38:40,045 --> 00:38:40,710
Come on...

442
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:45,887
-Let's say hello to them, shall we?
-After you, Mister Palmer.

443
00:39:07,124 --> 00:39:08,124
Shall we go?

444
00:39:14,498 --> 00:39:15,279
Palmer!

445
00:39:39,061 --> 00:39:40,061
You all right?

446
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:43,135
Difficult to say.

447
00:39:50,095 --> 00:39:51,251
Did you hear those voices?

448
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,415
-Any idea where we are?
-No.

449
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,580
 But look what I found.

450
00:40:23,705 --> 00:40:25,605
God, I hoped you'd
come and find me, Ross.

451
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,232
I knew you would.

452
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:37,776
How could I not come looking for you?

453
00:40:38,156 --> 00:40:39,563
Always in each other's minds.

454
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:53,784
 What have they tried to do, Natasha?

455
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:10,846
It's the real Winslet.

456
00:41:11,267 --> 00:41:13,267
The one the Nestenes 
copied in the first place?

457
00:41:13,292 --> 00:41:14,292
What the hell's he doing here?

458
00:41:14,815 --> 00:41:15,777
I thought he was dead.

459
00:41:15,802 --> 00:41:17,294
He was in a coma for about a year,

460
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,554
Then he came out of it.

461
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,919
Of course.

462
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,326
Millhampton Psychiatric Hospital.

463
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,115
The life came again.

464
00:41:28,448 --> 00:41:29,956
They said it wouldn't come back...

465
00:41:31,336 --> 00:41:32,519
The doctors and nurses.

466
00:41:32,998 --> 00:41:34,049
They said I was asleep...

467
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:36,620
That I'd woken up.

468
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:40,651
But it did come back.

469
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:50,117
Am I asleep again?

470
00:41:54,276 --> 00:41:55,649
Why can't I wake up?

471
00:41:57,178 --> 00:41:58,722
What have they 
dredged him up for?

472
00:41:59,507 --> 00:42:01,013
And what are we doing here?

473
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:06,102
And where's that bastard Palmer?

474
00:42:08,466 --> 00:42:10,007
Come on, Natasha.

475
00:42:10,602 --> 00:42:11,872
You can fight it.

476
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,502
I know your mind's strong enough.

477
00:42:13,526 --> 00:42:14,431
Tell me!

478
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:20,165
Listen to me.

479
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:23,553
We've got to find Lockwood...

480
00:42:23,982 --> 00:42:26,110
before the Nestene 
energy  starts

481
00:42:26,134 --> 00:42:28,134
flowing through his implant.

482
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,180
Where is he!

483
00:42:33,276 --> 00:42:34,336
Doctor Arnold.

484
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:40,731
As a matter of fact,
I have found a large

485
00:42:40,756 --> 00:42:42,766
number of crates with
the same serial code.

486
00:42:43,442 --> 00:42:46,429
Triple A stroke RH stroke 2961.

487
00:42:47,714 --> 00:42:48,931
Some of them have the letters...

488
00:42:49,664 --> 00:42:51,514
A.U.T.O.N

489
00:42:51,746 --> 00:42:52,501
written on them.

490
00:42:53,525 --> 00:42:54,336
I'm told.

491
00:42:55,835 --> 00:42:57,424
 Auton.

492
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,200
But I couldn't...

493
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:04,350
Think what...

494
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:05,799
I couldn't see...

495
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:07,730
I couldn't.

496
00:43:10,736 --> 00:43:12,720
I could see everything it could see...

497
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:15,226
Like a nightmare.

498
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,083
Who's Lockwood?

499
00:43:22,189 --> 00:43:22,889
Lockwood?

500
00:43:24,697 --> 00:43:25,851
Where is he? 
Have you seen him?

501
00:43:27,886 --> 00:43:29,649
He, he is...

502
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,225
He is dying.

503
00:43:35,475 --> 00:43:36,248
Dying?

504
00:43:37,018 --> 00:43:38,793
What do you mean? 
What have they done to him?

505
00:43:39,466 --> 00:43:41,000
Where is he?

506
00:43:41,445 --> 00:43:42,445
He, he's...

507
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:45,617
He's asleep.

508
00:43:47,815 --> 00:43:49,039
He can't wake up.

509
00:43:49,816 --> 00:43:51,515
 But if he doesn't wake up...

510
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:53,848
He'll die.

511
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:55,331
Lockwood...

512
00:43:56,608 --> 00:43:58,026
Absorbed the energy

513
00:43:58,224 --> 00:44:00,454
of the creature on Sentinel Island...

514
00:44:01,343 --> 00:44:02,549
But it broke free.

515
00:44:03,712 --> 00:44:04,350
It's...

516
00:44:04,397 --> 00:44:05,188
Buried...

517
00:44:05,212 --> 00:44:06,101
Deep...

518
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,833
They need me.

519
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:12,775
Awakening.

520
00:44:13,505 --> 00:44:14,361
Awakening?

521
00:44:14,622 --> 00:44:16,439
What do you mean, awakening?

522
00:44:17,268 --> 00:44:18,877
Dreams...

523
00:44:19,933 --> 00:44:21,776
And nightmares.

524
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,780
 I'm listening.

525
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
He's...

526
00:44:33,434 --> 00:44:34,497
He's your friend.

527
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:37,561
Yes...

528
00:44:38,982 --> 00:44:39,996
Of course he is.

529
00:44:41,442 --> 00:44:42,442
He's a one-off.

530
00:44:43,307 --> 00:44:44,333
Do you know where he is?

531
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,520
Bring them here.

532
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,100
Destroy the
others.

533
00:44:54,282 --> 00:44:55,282
No!

534
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:56,399
What is it?

535
00:45:01,974 --> 00:45:02,974
What now?

536
00:45:23,061 --> 00:45:24,231
My mind's not strong enough...

537
00:45:24,802 --> 00:45:25,779
But yours is.

538
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,100
They sensed your mind in mine.

539
00:45:28,782 --> 00:45:30,313
We haven't got much time.

540
00:45:31,686 --> 00:45:32,449
Read me.

541
00:45:50,966 --> 00:45:52,415
I can't keep this up for ever.

542
00:45:53,188 --> 00:45:55,801
-You know where he is. Now go!
-Not without you.

543
00:45:55,826 --> 00:45:56,826
I'm not strong enough to.

544
00:45:58,278 --> 00:45:59,584
Please go.

545
00:46:34,363 --> 00:46:35,363
Hello, Sal.

546
00:46:36,942 --> 00:46:37,563
Lockwood.

547
00:46:42,951 --> 00:46:44,419
More dreams.

548
00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:45,903
No, not dreams.

549
00:46:46,919 --> 00:46:48,321
James and I are real enough.

550
00:46:56,974 --> 00:46:57,974
You're real.

551
00:47:00,552 --> 00:47:01,550
Sal...

552
00:47:02,169 --> 00:47:03,394
What have you done?

553
00:47:03,593 --> 00:47:04,593
What?

554
00:47:05,638 --> 00:47:06,662
No...

555
00:47:08,082 --> 00:47:09,206
 No!

556
00:47:11,822 --> 00:47:13,484
Thank you, Doctor Arnold.

557
00:47:52,164 --> 00:47:53,878
Palmer! What the hell's going on?

558
00:47:54,743 --> 00:47:55,691
We were right.

559
00:47:55,968 --> 00:47:57,860
They are using Lockwood's implant.

560
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,503
Using it as a means...

561
00:47:59,947 --> 00:48:01,480
Of transmitting their energy.

562
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:03,377
Awakening.

563
00:48:03,482 --> 00:48:05,129
-What!
-Awakening.

564
00:48:06,394 --> 00:48:10,012
Lockwood's been trying to keep them
out of his mind all this time.

565
00:48:11,236 --> 00:48:13,784
They tried to use 
Natasha's psychic abilities...

566
00:48:14,005 --> 00:48:15,335
To break his resolve...

567
00:48:15,866 --> 00:48:17,306
But it didn't work.

568
00:48:18,141 --> 00:48:19,510
But they sensed in me...

569
00:48:19,804 --> 00:48:22,626
Psychic powers that even 
Natasha didn't possess.

570
00:48:23,094 --> 00:48:24,570
They thought I'd do it for them...

571
00:48:25,507 --> 00:48:27,003
But it was you two...

572
00:48:27,209 --> 00:48:28,448
His friends.

573
00:48:30,067 --> 00:48:31,985
And now we've buggered everything up.

574
00:48:33,419 --> 00:48:35,737
We're activating a
billion Nestene

575
00:48:35,762 --> 00:48:38,477
creatures buried
throughout your world.

576
00:48:40,974 --> 00:48:42,290
They're coming back to life.

577
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:44,450
Awakening.

578
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:53,084
You have served your purpose.

579
00:48:54,012 --> 00:48:55,441
You are no longer
necessary.

580
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:07,674
I won't let you use my mind.

581
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,800
Not again.

582
00:49:18,742 --> 00:49:20,742
I won't let you!

583
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,030
Get close to him.

584
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,958
Right hand button,
three times.

585
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:42,493
Oh, Lockwood, no!

586
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:44,856
That's the trouble with dreams.

587
00:49:46,459 --> 00:49:47,883
However nice they are...

588
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:52,499
You always have to wake up.

589
00:51:10,448 --> 00:51:11,647
It's over...

590
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:28,105
Did you ever stop to consider 
the risk to Lockwood?

591
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,111
Your best operative,

592
00:51:30,269 --> 00:51:31,796
UNIT's star performer...

593
00:51:31,842 --> 00:51:33,012
that's what you made him believe.

594
00:51:33,418 --> 00:51:35,061
And all the time you
were planning to drive

595
00:51:35,086 --> 00:51:36,541
him like a sheep
through a mine field.

596
00:51:36,566 --> 00:51:39,115
It was the only course 
of action left open to me.

597
00:51:39,974 --> 00:51:42,019
As far back as the
warehouse weknew

598
00:51:42,044 --> 00:51:43,861
Lockwood had been compromised.

599
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,892
He wasn't compromised, 
he was fighting it.

600
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:49,442
Instead of sending spooks
to try and catch him out,

601
00:51:49,467 --> 00:51:51,933
did it never cross your mind 
to ask him what was going on?

602
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:53,775
It may have escaped 
your notice, Doctor Arnold,

603
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,926
but we've just been fighting a war.

604
00:51:58,172 --> 00:52:00,345
There's no room for sentiment in a war.

605
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:03,006
You used my feelings...

606
00:52:03,522 --> 00:52:04,617
My feelings for Lockwood.

607
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:06,454
You knew perfectly well 
what taking me there would do.

608
00:52:07,259 --> 00:52:08,259
Yes.

609
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:10,776
Get him out of my sight.
