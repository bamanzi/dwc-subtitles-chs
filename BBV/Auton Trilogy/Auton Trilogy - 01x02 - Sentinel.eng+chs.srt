153
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,215
And drive off in truck.
然后开着卡车走了

154
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:17,687
- Where to?  - Well...
- 去了哪儿？  - 这个...

155
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:22,014
If we can find out where the sheet's from,
如果我们能搞明白这张布单来自哪儿

156
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:25,368
we may find out where the energy unit came from,
我们也许能找到能量体的来源

157
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:28,833
and perhaps where the Autons have gone.
或许也能找到 Auton 都去了哪里

158
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:30,547
Not necessarily.
不一定

159
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:33,400
No, not necessarily, Colonel.
的确，不一定，上校

160
00:13:33,776 --> 00:13:37,164
But since your truck seems to have vanished
off the face of the Earth,
但既然你的卡车似乎是从地球表面上消失了

161
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:39,684
I've resorted to grasping at straws.
我就不得不抓住每根稻草了

162
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:41,755
Who do you think put the 
energy unit there?
你觉得是谁把能量体放在那里了？

163
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:44,440
What a bizarre question, young lady.
这是一个多么奇怪的问题啊，小姐

164
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,410
If I knew that, I wouldn't be groping around here.
我要是知道那个，就不会在这里摸索了

165
00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:53,186
Well, if you have any more flashes
of insight, do let me know.
好吧, 如果你有更多的灵感, 一定要告诉我

166
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:54,603
Come on, Corporal. Shift it.
快点，下士。走吧

167
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,851
You knew that energy unit had been
here before you checked.
你在检查之前就知道那个能量体当时是在这里

168
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:00,192
Oh, yes?
噢，是吗？

169
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:02,105
And how long have you been psychic?

170
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:03,772
Only since birth.
生下来才当上

171
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,490
So you read my mind.
所以你读过我的思维了

172
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:08,635
No.
没有

173
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,150
It was written all over your face.
都写在你的脸上呢

174
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:12,590
I think I'll wait in the car.
我想我还是去车里等

175
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:28,345
Will everything be all right
now they've arrived?

176
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,813
Yes, of course it will, Daron.

177
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,138
What did you want to see me about, Vicar?
你要见我做什么，Vicar？

178
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:02,097
Daron... you were always the first.
Daron...你一直都是第一个

179
00:15:02,796 --> 00:15:06,128
You were always the one 
with the most fervour.
你一直都是最有热情的一个

180
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:13,857
You led the way for the others.
你为其他人指明方向

181
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,133
Am I to be the one?
我将成为那个人吗？

00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,027
Yes, of course, Daron.
是的，当然，Daron

183
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,762
But there is one thing I must ask of you.
但有一件事我必须问你

184
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:27,466
You mean... you mean
to prove myself worthy.
你是说...是说要证明我自己的价值

185
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:28,519
Yes.
是的

Are you willing?

There's nothing I won't do.

Because there are those 
among our community,
因为在我们的社区里有一些...

190
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:39,639
mercifully few, I'm glad to say, 
who simply do not believe.
好在不多，这点我很高兴 - 有一些人就是不相信

00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:41,136
Oh, they'll come around, Vicar.
哦，他们会转变过来的，Vicar

00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:43,705
- I'm sure of it.
- Time is short, Daron.
- 我很确信  - 时间很短，Daron

193
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:48,164
We have opened our hearts to these souls
and they have refused us.
我们向这些灵魂敞开了心扉, 他们拒绝了我们

194
00:15:48,937 --> 00:15:52,108
That refusal has led them 
straight into the hands of Satan.
这种拒绝让他们直接落入了撒旦的手中

195
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,970
Now that our disciples have arrived,

196
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:58,008
these servants of the devil...
这些魔鬼的仆人...

00:15:58,071 --> 00:15:59,396
must be struck down.
必须被打倒

198
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:07,510
You know who they are, don't you?

199
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:15,307
And all you have to do is think of them,

200
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:17,773
and they will be delivered from evil.

Hi. What's up?

All I'm getting is a brick wall.

- But that's not possible.  - I know.

210
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:45,792
It seems someone doesn't 
want me to know about this.
看来有人不想让我知道这个

211
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:49,415
Well, there's nothing on the 
standard personnel register.

212
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:51,593
It could mean she's pretty important.
这可能意味着她相当重要

213
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:53,704
Keep looking for me...
继续帮我找...

00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:57,580
Yeah, okay.

Oh, by the way, I may have something for you
on that sheet sample.
哦，顺便说下，那个布单采样我可能有点信息给你

217
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:02,612
Yes?
是什么？

218
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:04,308
Well, it's old, that's for sure.
哦，它很老，这是当然的

It doesn't conform to any types
manufactured within the last ten years.

00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:20,211
Oh, yes.
噢，能

225

He's not going to make it easy for me,

but we're going to get along just fine.

00:17:25,605 --> 00:17:28,194
You are clear about your orders, Natasha?

228
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:29,782
Quite clear, Colonel.
相当清楚，上校

229
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,909
Those are the possible points of
origin for the sheet.
这些都是那个布单的的可能出处

230
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,519
This is going to mean an increase
in manpower.

00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:40,789
- Can't we narrow it down?  - Afraid not.

has been available within

234
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:46,391
This is ridiculous.
这太荒谬了

235
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,889
Just because the sheet comes
from one area doesn't mean to say...
这布单来自哪里，并不就是说...

236
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:49,434
that's where the truck has gone.
卡车就去了哪里

237
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:50,791
No, but it's a start.

And I do think you need at least to 
make a start, Colonel Wilson.
而且我真的觉得你需要有个起点，Wilson上校

Is someone going to drive me home?

251
00:19:58,437 --> 00:20:00,117
It's not my choice.
不是我选择的

252
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:02,736
And it's certainly not your choice, I know.

253
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,313
But you and I don't have any choice, do we?
但你跟我都没有什么选择，是吧？

254
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:09,552
That's something the 
two of us have in common.

255
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:16,079
They recruited me as a child.

Couldn't lie to me, you see,

258
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:23,904
and I kept blowing all
the fuses in the house

every time I was smacked

Yes, you and I have a lot in common, Lockwood.

264
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:45,807

Remember what you were thinking 
when you first saw that sheet.

That should do the trick.
这招应该可以了

After all, we don't want to go charging in 
like the D-day landings.
毕竟, 我们不想像诺曼底登陆那样冲锋

283
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,485
This could all be a wild goose chase.

284
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:07,112
It isn't.
不是

285

Yes, well...

get the British government's permission for

496
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:08,389
You're mixing your metaphors.
你的比喻太混乱了
