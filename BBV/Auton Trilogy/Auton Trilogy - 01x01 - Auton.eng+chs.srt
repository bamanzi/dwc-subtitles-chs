00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,801
I mean, that thing exploded.
I don't know what was inside it.
我是说, 那个东西爆炸了, 我不知道里面有什么

146
00:15:47,802 --> 00:15:50,532
If you didn't know what was inside it, 
why did you subject it to transmissions
如果你不知道里面有什么, 为什么要让它传输信息

147
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:53,302
from UNIT's most powerful
deep-space scanning satellites?
连的还都是 UNIT 最强大的深空扫描卫星

148
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,199
Because...
因为...

149
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:58,416
Because it was the only course
of relevant experimentation left.
因为这是唯一剩下的相关实验过程

150
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:02,685
I'd drawn a blank with the damn thing,
thought it was dead.
那个破玩意儿我一直什么结果也没得到, 以为它是个死的

151
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:06,296
I tried every test I could think of.
我试过了我能想到的每项测试

152
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:10,443
That is my job, Doctor Matthews.
Assess and catalogue.
这是我的工作, Matthews 博士, 评估、分类

153
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,538
I knew it was of extra-terrestrial origin.
我知道它是来自外星的

154
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,077
Wasn't just a meteor.
It appeared to be manufactured,
但又不是颗流星. 看起来是制造出来的

155
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:18,169
so I speculated...
于是我推断...

156
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:21,056
- Oh, you speculated.  - Yes.
- 噢, 你推断...  - 是的

157
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:24,892
We don't exactly have information
here at our fingertips, I'm afraid.
恐怕我们手头并没有信息

158
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,597
This place was a sort of forgotten
Aladdin's Cave until about five years ago.
这个地方被遗忘了, 跟阿拉丁的山洞似的, 直到五年前

159
00:16:30,565 --> 00:16:33,665
It was a mess. Mountains of old paperwork.
一团乱麻, 数不清的文书工作

160
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,178
Winslet hasn't even got a
tenth of the way through it.
这一路上, Winslet 做的连一成都不到

161
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:38,202
We're working blind-folded most of.
我们一直都在蒙着眼瞎摸

162
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:43,665
Are you saying you know more about it?
你是说你知道它更多情况? 

163
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:46,994
Where do you get your information?
你是从哪儿获取信息的? 

164
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:49,776
I think you're ready to speak to Lockwood.
我觉得你已经准备好跟 Lookwood 谈话了

165
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:54,972
Are we in danger?
我们有危险吗? 

166
00:16:57,011 --> 00:16:58,011
It's possible.
有可能

167
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:04,284
So where were you when it all happened?
那事情发生的时候你们在哪儿? 

168
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:06,403
Storage bay one, you said just now.
一号储物岛, 你刚才说的

169
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,538
- Yes.  - And you heard the alarm,
- 是的  - 然后你听到了警报

170
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:12,078
and you thought I think I'll just stay
here and pick my nose, is that it?
然后你想, 我还是待在这里挖我的鼻子, 是这样吗? 

171
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:14,237
- No, no.  - Well then, what?
- 不, 不是  - 那, 是怎样的

172
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:17,915
Doctor Arnold was conducting
her experiment in her laboratory
Arnold 博士在她的实验室进行她的实验

173
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:24,978
on this alien artefact, serial code
triple A stroke RH stroke 2961,
实验对象是这个外星物品, 编号 AAA/RH/2961

174
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,902
and she asked me to find
any other containers with that code.
而且她让我找同样编号的其它箱子

175
00:17:28,303 --> 00:17:29,683
Because she thought there might be more of them?
因为她觉得还有更多同样的? 

176
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:33,333
Or anything that would help her identify 
what she was dealing with.
或者任何其它东西, 只要能有助于她识别出她正在对付的是什么

177
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:36,423
She wasn't dealing with anything, Mister Winslet
她没在对付任何东西, Winslet 先生！

178
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:41,125
She was tampering with the unknown, 
which is always pretty dangerous.
她在玩耍她不懂的东西, 这总是相当危险的

179
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:44,198
Did you find any other crates with 
the same code on them, by the way?
对了, 你找到了其它有同样编号的板条箱了吗? 

180
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:47,333
- No.  - Greyhound One to Greyhound Leader.
- 没有  - 灰狗一号呼叫灰狗队长

181
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:53,682
- Greyhound Leader.
- We have a problem.
- 我是灰狗队长  - 我们有问题了

182
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:05,038
- Same as the woman?
- I should say so.

Mister Lockwood, what is going on?

185
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:13,374
Exits are already secured.
出口已经把守住了

186
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:16,152
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know, exactly.
- 我们在找什么?   - 我不知道, 确切地说

187
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:18,707
Whatever it is, it can't be very big.
不管是什么, 应该不会很大

188
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:21,644
- Well, he didn't see it coming.
- Where is it going?
- 嗯, 他没看到它过来  - 那它又去哪儿了? 

189
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,884
Well, presuming it started here
好, 假设它从这里开始

190
00:18:24,908 --> 00:18:26,011
Oh, let's presume.
噢, 我们假设

191
00:18:26,036 --> 00:18:29,265
- Too many variables give me a headache.
- It's going through the storage bays,
- 变数太多让我头疼  - 它穿过了这些储物岛

192
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:32,362
whatever it is you're talking about. Look.
不管你们在说的是什么. 你看

193
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:35,616
Well, what are you talking about?
好了, 你们在说的是什么? 

194
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:40,061
Carry on, Ramsay, and see that 
Doctor Arnold is kept out of harm's way.
继续吧 Ramsay, 同时确保Arnold 博士处于危险地带之外

195
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:54,734
What have we got?

196
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,154
We haven't got any of the right
equipment, for a start.
比如说, 我们一件合适的装备都没有

197
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,525
This was a code seven, contamination risk.
这可是7号情况, 有污染风险

198
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,623
Yes. Bit of a balls-up, isn't it.
是啊, 事有点大, 对吧

199
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:06,220
I should have twigged there was no danger
of contamination the moment I saw the code.
在我看见代号那会儿, 我应该就直接说没有危险

200
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:09,353
- Triple A   - RH 2961.
- 3个A  - RH 2961

201
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:11,377
Seems no one here knew what it meant.
看来这里没人知道这是什么意思

202
00:19:12,003 --> 00:19:15,067
But I didn't expect it to
turn into a bug hunt either.
但我估计它也不是抓抓虫子这种事

203
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:17,686
- This is something new.
- Should we call for back-up?
- 这是个新情况  - 我们应该呼叫支援吗? 

204
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:19,580
To pick over our remains.
来抬我们的遗体吗

205
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:23,457
Great sense of humour, Lockwood.
幽默感不错, Lockwood

00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:25,015

Sorry.

00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:41,606
- This Lockwood.  - Not much.
- 这个 Lockwood  - 没什么

210
00:19:43,701 --> 00:19:46,785
What do you think of him?
I think he's a bit high-handed.
你觉得他怎么样? 我觉得他有点专横

211
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:57,698
Sorry about Janice.
Janice 的事很抱歉

212
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:09,577
We've got to find a way to track the damn thing.
我们得想个办法追踪这该死的东西

213
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:12,292
There's nothing feasible with the
level of equipment we've got here.
就我们手头这些设备的级别, 没有什么可行性

214
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:14,792
What is it they say about a bad workman?

<i>(英语俗语 A bad workman quarrels with his tools

215
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:16,872
Oh, you're calling me a bad workman.

216

What do you want to do, Dan?
你想怎么做, Dan? 

217
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:26,077
Join the search. See what else has got
hidden away here, what it might be after.
加入搜索工作. 看看还有什么藏在这里, 它的企图又是什么

218
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:31,200
Our esteemed Doctor Sally Arnold apparently
instructed Mister Personality Winslet...
我们可敬的 Sally Arnold 博士显然已经让 Winslet 先生...

219
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:35,675
...to conduct a thorough search for 
anything else with the same code.
...全面搜索了有同样编码的其它箱子

220
00:20:36,822 --> 00:20:39,894
But would he draw back?
I still think it's worth double-checking.
但他会怠工吗? 我还是觉得值得核查一遍

221
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:44,259
I never trusted the brain cell count 
in research establishments.
对研究机构的事我从不相信人脑细胞

222
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:48,386
All right, Have Ramsay bring
Sally Arnold to her laboratory.
好吧, 让 Ramsay 把 Sally Arnold 带到她的实验室

223
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,085
I shall be waiting to give her my charm offensive.

Doctor Arnold? Come with me, please.
Arnold 博士吗? 请跟我来

227
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:14,162
So he's finally deigned to speak with me, has he?
所以他终于屈尊要和我谈话了, 是吗? 

228
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:16,424
- Who would that be, Doctor?
- Your boss, Lockwood.
- 你说谁, 博士?   - 你的老大, Lockwood

229
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:18,226
I believe he does want a word with you, yes, Doctor.
我相信他确实想和你聊一聊, 是的, 博士

230
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,607

for you, Sergeant.
我想这一切对你来说都是很常规的, 中士

- This is the long way.

Come on, I'll show you a short cut.

234
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:50,029
Do sit down.

What did you make of these symbols?

What did I make of them?
I've never seen anything like them.

237
00:22:02,395 --> 00:22:03,958
All right, all right.
好吧, 好吧

00:22:03,982 --> 00:22:07,490
Did you think, oops, dear me, what have I done?
你有没有想过：糟糕, 我啊, 我做了什么啊?

Because I'd like to put to you that is 
what you should have been thinking,

given that something is now
crawling around the building

241
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:16,353
apparently with the intention
of wiping out my team.

242
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,671
- Something? What is this something?  - That.
- 某个东西? 某个东西是什么?   - 那个

243
00:22:27,451 --> 00:22:30,695
You mean it didn't just vaporise when it exploded.
你是说它爆炸的时候不只是蒸发了

244
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:33,693
Doctor Sal is thinking.
Sal 博士开始用脑子了

245
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:37,004
Doctor Sal, that's what all
your chums call you, isn't it?
Sal 博士, 你那些密友都这么称呼你, 是吧? 

246
00:22:37,187 --> 00:22:40,417

A working class comprehensive
school girl who ended up...

00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:49,576
with degrees in medicine,
physics, chemistry and biology.

I see you've read my file.

You're a bit of a maverick
in the scientific community.
你在科学界算是个独行侠

252
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:56,871
Not afraid to put forward new and untested ideas.
从不畏惧实施新颖而未经检验的想法

253
00:22:56,896 --> 00:23:00,323
I suppose that accounts for
the stupidity of your actions here.
我觉得那就是你在这里做出愚蠢行为的原因

254
00:23:00,348 --> 00:23:04,450
- It's easy to be wise with hindsight.
- Wisdom does not come into it.

255
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,435
Some excrement has hit the fan,

were the idiot who turned the fan on.

It's a job which I happen to consider important.

00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:18,776
I can't help it if UNIT doesn't fund us properly.
UNIT 不能给我们提供足够资金的话, 我就帮不上忙了

260
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:21,991
I work with the best information
that I have available to me.
我充分利用我所能得到的信息

261
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:27,507
In my opinion, underfunding of this
facility makes it a dangerous liability.

262
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:30,153
However, these are not matters

263
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:33,880
for mere slaves of the UNIT bureaucracy like ourselves.

I'm here to pick up the pieces.

serial code triple A RH 2961.
我是你的外星物品, 编号 AAA/RH/2961

00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:51,583
You connect me up to the widest range of 
deep-space signals available to mankind
你把我连上了人类所能获得的范围最广的深空信号

267
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,478
Why?
为什么? 

268
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:55,216
Because it hadn't responded
to any other kind of test.
因为它对其它种类的测试都没有响应

269
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:57,795
God save us from mavericks.
上帝把我们从独行侠手中救出来吧

270
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:03,668
You can test a gun all you like, 
but it doesn't work until you pull the trigger.
一把枪你想怎么测试都行, 但在你扣动扳机之前, 它是不会工作的

271
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:06,128
You're saying I pulled the trigger?
你是说是我扣动了扳机? 

272
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:11,506
It recognised one of the signals
from out there in deep space.
它识别出了一个来自深空的讯号

273
00:24:11,531 --> 00:24:14,517
It came alive and received instructions.
它苏醒过来, 接收了指令

274
00:24:15,643 --> 00:24:19,239
Now, what kind of an instruction
is please vaporise?
现在看看, “请你爆炸”是一个什么样的指令? 

275
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:21,620
Not a very friendly one.

276
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:25,311
And this artefact was undoubtedly
talking to a friend,

277
00:24:25,335 --> 00:24:29,596
so perhaps it was instructed to do something else.
所以它有可能被指派去干点什么事情

278
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:46,721
So you're saying it atomised
in order to reform itself...

Are there any other artefacts in
the warehouse like this one?
仓库里还有其它类似的物件吗? 

288
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:57,809
I don't know. Maybe. I asked Winslet
to look for anything with the same coding.
我不知道, 也许有. 我跟 Winslet 说过让他找有相同编号的

00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:17,447
It's hostile, and God help us
if you have any more artefacts...
