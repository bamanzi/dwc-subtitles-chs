1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Syncro:
F.B Cavalcante

2
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,690
Greyhound Seven to Trap One.

3
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,550
Proceeding as scheduled.

4
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:39,174
Should reach checkpoint 
seven at oh four fifty. Over.

5
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:41,158
Understood.
Out.

6
00:00:41,827 --> 00:00:42,943
Talkative, aren't they?

7
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:16,957
Bloody hell.

8
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:21,679
Greyhound Seven to Trap One.
Over.

9
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:27,492
Greyhound Seven to Trap One.
Come in please. Over.

10
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:31,292
What the hell's that?

11
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:35,419
Greyhound Seven to Trap One.
Obstruction on road.

12
00:01:35,494 --> 00:01:36,689
Please advise.
Over.

13
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:41,664
Another cock-up.

14
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,799
Just in case.

15
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:03,581
Mike, I think there's someone here round
the back of the truck.

16
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,140
Mike.

17
00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:21,709
Dave!

18
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,539
Don't move.

19
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,444
Don't move or I fire.

20
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:13,452
Congratulations, 
Colonel Wilson.

21
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:16,428
It is regrettable.

22
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:18,452
It is, Colonel Wilson,

23
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:21,273
a balls-up of the most 
staggering magnitude.

24
00:04:24,696 --> 00:04:26,196
Doctor Arnold.

25
00:04:30,014 --> 00:04:33,337
-What's going on?
-It seems we've lost the Autons.

26
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:36,311
What?
How?

27
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:38,416
It was a covert operation.

28
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:39,725
An unmarked vehicle.

29
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:40,913
No escort.

30
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:43,454
What, a lorry load of Autons?

31
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,749
I thought they'd all been incinerated.

32
00:04:45,877 --> 00:04:48,147
That was our recommendation 
two years ago.

33
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:51,062
Someone, apparently,
had a different idea.

34
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:53,566
They were being transported to a

35
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:55,951
classified location
for further research.

36
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:56,721
Further?

37
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,245
We spent six months dissecting one.

38
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:00,645
We made a full report.

39
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:03,292
So how do you propose to get them
back, Colonel?

40
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:04,592
Back from where?

41
00:05:04,893 --> 00:05:06,003
Look, what exactly happened?

42
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:07,787
We're not exactly sure.

43
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,178
I sent a back-up unit
immediately, but when

44
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:12,461
they arrived there was
no sign of the truck.

45
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,986
We've given the civilian
authorities a description,

46
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:18,221
the number plate, and
orders not to approach,

47
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:20,651
but as yet we've heard nothing.

48
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:22,475
In short, Colonel Wilson,

49
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:26,137
you've lost a bunch of 
deadly alien killing machines.

50
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:00,173
Lockwood?

51
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:01,480
Lockwood, are you ready yet?

52
00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:02,954
Yes.

53
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:04,499
Yes, just coming.

54
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:18,033
You know, I was just beginning to hope
that our escaped Nestene creature from the

55
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:20,748
warehouse might just have
curled up and died somewhere.

56
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,159
Are we assuming it's behind all this?

57
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,317
Reclaiming it's minions?

58
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:27,776
Possibly, but how did it 
know where to find them?

59
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,255
Maybe they just came 
into range by chance?

60
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:33,787
You all right, Lockwood?

61
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:35,462
Sorry, Sal.

62
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,002
I haven't been sleeping too well lately.

63
00:06:40,756 --> 00:06:41,772
Right, Colonel.

64
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:44,748
I take it you're up to speed on the whole
Auton issue, yes?

65
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:50,329
Nestene energy unit reactivation 
at the warehouse two years ago.

66
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,755
Auton assumes the likeness of senior

67
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,804
Archivist Graham Winslet, 
absorbs two energy units,

68
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:59,145
attempts a few faltering
steps at world domination,

69
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,741
then reconstitutes into
a blob and scarpers

70
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:03,925
when the odd on success start to look bad.

71
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:05,454
I've read the file.

72
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:09,144
You must understand that 
I'm not here to tread on anybody's toes.

73
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,604
But I do have my orders.

74
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,723
Direct from Geneva.

75
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,208
I have my own team, and I've been appointed
head of this investigation.

76
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,605
Why?

77
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:32,612
That's your signature.

78
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:36,695
On a transportation
docket for all artefacts

79
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,236
coded triple A stroke
RH stroke 2961.

80
00:07:40,582 --> 00:07:43,632
You ordered the 
relocation of those Autons.

81
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:47,621
Geneva has ordered that you, 
Lockwood, join us.

82
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:53,228
Your role will be to provide any specialist
information my own scientific adviser may

83
00:07:55,114 --> 00:07:57,884
I want the exclusion of
my containment team from

84
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:00,935
this investigation on the
record, need access to. Colonel.

85
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,574
Of course.

86
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,139
And I insist that Doctor Arnold
accompanies me.

87
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:08,281
Her work in the field of 
Nestene technology is unparalleled.

88
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:10,899
That won't be necessary.

89
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:12,571
The car's waiting.
We're late.

90
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:13,649
Thank you, Colonel.

91
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:15,287
I'll be with you in a moment.

92
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,408
Did you issue that order?

93
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:24,156
No.

94
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:25,872
Something's going on.

95
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:27,505
But what?

96
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:29,419
What are you going to do?

97
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:32,681
Obey orders.

98
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:36,854
Have you got one of these, Sal?

99
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:36,883
Ramsay!

100
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,701
It's nice to see one friendly face at least.

101
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:41,462
You two know each other, then.

102
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:42,502
Yes, sir.

103
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:45,058
I was assigned to the original 
warehouse containment team.

104
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,180
Any reports on the missing truck?

105
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,090
Not as yet, sir, but tracks suggest
it went back the way it came.

106
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,106
-It's good to see you again, Ramsay.
-And you, sir.

107
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,129
Are Doctor Arnold  and 
Doctor Matthews still with you?

108
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:59,950
Dan's been digging up alien artefacts
in Africa for the last six months,

109
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,518
 but Sal's still putting up with me.

110
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:02,878
Why isn't she here with you?

111
00:11:02,998 --> 00:11:04,256
This is Wilson's show.

112
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:24,646
There was something in it.

113
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:26,750
Brilliant.

114
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:29,488
Something... powerful.

115
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,758
Something alive.

116
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:33,893
And how did you deduce that, 
young lady?

117
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:39,607
Lockwood, this is Natasha Alexander,
my scientific advisor.

118
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,292
Really.

119
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:43,858
Well?

120
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:45,599
I felt it.

121
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:49,885
So did you, didn't you.

122
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,502
This is Lockwood.

123
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:58,280
Priority code 8954B.

124
00:11:58,412 --> 00:12:01,375
Relay me to containment HQ, please.

125
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:04,685
Morning, Sal.

126
00:12:04,747 --> 00:12:05,800
Hi.
How's it going?

127
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,396
Thought you might 
have gone back to bed.

128
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:08,651
What have you got for me?

129
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:11,746
I'm scanning some kind of sheet
left at the scene of the crime.

130
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:16,970
Are you getting this?

131
00:12:17,272 --> 00:12:20,184
Yes, receiving your transmission.
Just cross-referencing.

132
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:23,121
Oh, match's up.

133
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:26,534
Trace of radiation typical of 
Nestene energy readings.

134
00:12:26,587 --> 00:12:27,540
Thought so.

135
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,538
Ramsay, have a
sample of this sheet

136
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:33,014
sent back to Sal for analysis.

137
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:36,336
Sergeant Ramsay 
says hello, by the way, Sal.

138
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:37,496
Hello, Sal?

139
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:38,614
So he does.

140
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Hello, James.

141
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:46,278
Sir.

142
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,930
Let me know when 
you've got something, Sal.

143
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:51,641
Will do.
Bye.

144
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,219
Sorry, old chap.

145
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:55,184
Can't work without back-up.

146
00:12:55,815 --> 00:12:56,868
Hope you don't mind.

147
00:12:58,135 --> 00:12:59,674
What's your assessment?

148
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:06,633
 Nestene energy unit 
put here by someone.

149
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:11,222
Energy unit activates Autons in truck.

150
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:13,913
Autons kill your men...

151
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,215
And drive off in truck.

152
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:17,687
-Where to?
-Well...

153
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:22,014
If we can find out 
where the sheet's from,

154
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:25,368
 we may find out where 
the energy unit came from,

155
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:28,833
and perhaps where 
the Autons have gone.

156
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:30,547
Not necessarily.

157
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:33,400
No, not necessarily, Colonel.

158
00:13:33,776 --> 00:13:37,164
But since your truck seems to have vanished
off the face of the Earth,

159
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:39,684
I've resorted to 
grasping at straws.

160
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:41,755
Who do you think put the 
energy unit there?

161
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:44,440
What a bizarre question, young lady.

162
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,410
If I knew that, I wouldn't be
groping around here.

163
00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:53,186
Well, if you have any more flashes
of insight, do let me know.

164
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:54,603
Come on, Corporal.
Shift it.

165
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,851
You knew that energy unit had been
here before you checked.

166
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:00,192
Oh, yes?

167
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:02,105
And how long have you been psychic?

168
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:03,772
Only since birth.

169
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,490
So you read my mind.

170
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:08,635
No.

171
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,150
It was written all over your face.

172
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:12,590
I think I'll wait in the car.

173
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:28,345
Will everything
be all right now they've arrived?

174
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,813
Yes, of course it will, Daron.

175
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,138
What did you want to see me about, Vicar?

176
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:02,097
Daron... you were always the first.

177
00:15:02,796 --> 00:15:06,128
You were always the one 
with the most fervour.

178
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:13,857
You led the way for the others.

179
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,133
Am I to be the one?

180
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,027
Yes, of course, Daron.

181
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,762
But there is one thing 
I must ask of you.

182
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:27,466
You mean... you mean 
to prove myself worthy.

183
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:28,519
Yes.

184
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:30,271
Are you willing?

185
00:15:31,422 --> 00:15:32,875
There's nothing I won't do.

186
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,281
Good, good.

187
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:36,341
Because there are those 
among our community,

188
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:39,639
mercifully few, I'm glad to say, 
who simply do not believe.

189
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:41,136
Oh, they'll come around, Vicar.

190
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:43,705
-I'm sure of it.
-Time is short, Daron.

191
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:48,164
We have opened our hearts to 
these souls and they have refused us.

192
00:15:48,937 --> 00:15:52,108
That refusal has led them 
straight into the hands of Satan.

193
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,970
Now that our disciples have arrived,

194
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:58,008
these servants of the devil...

195
00:15:58,071 --> 00:15:59,396
must be struck down.

196
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:07,510
You know who they are, don't you?

197
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:15,307
And all you have 
to do is think of them,

198
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:17,773
and they will be delivered from evil.

199
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:22,178
Priority code 8954B.

200
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:23,203
Secure line.

201
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,070
Get me containment HQ, please.

202
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:27,725
Sal?

203
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,775
Hi.
What's up?

204
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,606
I want you to find out all you can
on Natasha Alexander.

205
00:16:33,836 --> 00:16:35,230
-Why?
-Because...

206
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:38,117
All I'm getting 
is a brick wall.

207
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:41,214
-But that's not possible.
-I know.

208
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:45,792
It seems someone doesn't 
want me to know about this.

209
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:49,415
Well, there's nothing on the standard
personnel register.

210
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:51,593
It could mean she's pretty important.

211
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:53,704
Keep looking for me...

212
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:55,947
-Would you?
-Yes.

213
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:57,580
Yeah, okay.

214
00:16:57,857 --> 00:17:01,467
Oh, by the way, I may have something for you
on that sheet sample.

215
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:02,612
Yes?

216
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:04,308
Well, it's old, that's for sure.

217
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,517
It doesn't conform to any types
manufactured within the last ten years.

218
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,751
Oh, here we go.

219
00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:14,461
Oh, you're not going to like this.

220
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:15,716
Try me.

221
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,948
Do you think you can work with him?

222
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:20,211
Oh, yes.

223
00:17:20,593 --> 00:17:22,546
He's not going to make it easy for me,

224
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,570
but we're going to get along just fine.

225
00:17:25,605 --> 00:17:28,194
You are clear about 
your orders, Natasha?

226
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:29,782
Quite clear, Colonel.

227
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,909
Those are the possible points of
origin for the sheet.

228
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,519
This is going to mean an increase
in manpower.

229
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:40,789
-Can't we narrow it down?
-Afraid not.

230
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:43,117
Those are all the locations
where that make of sheet

231
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:45,271
has been available within
a hundred mile radius.

232
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:46,391
This is ridiculous.

233
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,889
Just because the sheet comes
from one area doesn't

234
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:49,434
mean to say that's where
the truck has gone.

235
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:50,791
No, but it's a start.

236
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:54,549
And I do think you need at least to 
make a start, Colonel Wilson.

237
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,006
You've got a feeling about that sheet,
haven't you, Lockwood.

238
00:17:57,296 --> 00:17:58,296
No.

239
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:00,778
Is someone going to drive me home?

240
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:03,427
You will give me a call,
won't you, Colonel,

241
00:18:03,452 --> 00:18:05,321
when you've come up
with something useful.

242
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:07,822
I'll get in the car.

243
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:08,965
Again.

244
00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:15,631
Can't wait to get 
away from you, can he?

245
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:16,844
Give me a map.

246
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:51,448
Sorry to interrupt.

247
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:55,355
You're not going back 
to containment HQ, Lockwood.

248
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:57,802
We're going to be working together.

249
00:19:58,437 --> 00:20:00,117
It's not my choice.

250
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:02,736
And it's certainly not
your choice, I know.

251
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,313
But you and I don't 
have any choice, do we?

252
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:09,552
That's something the 
stwo of us have in common.

253
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:16,079
They recruited me as a child.

254
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:19,631
Parents didn't want me, 
couldn't cope with their psychic daughter.

255
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:21,551
Couldn't lie to me, you see,

256
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:23,904
and I kept blowing all
the fuses in the house

257
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:25,980
every time I was smacked
and sent to my room.

258
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,079
UNIT's been my life.

259
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,963
Yes, you and I have a
lot in common, Lockwood.

260
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,989
Take a look at these locations.

261
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,660
-Now what?
-Simple psychic trick.

262
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:45,807
My party piece.

263
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:50,397
Remember what you were 
thinking when you first saw that sheet?

264
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:52,634
-I wasn't thinking anything.
-Remember.

265
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,552
Sentinel Island.

266
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:15,677
No, not just bad dreams.

267
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:31,549
It's over.

268
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,497
Is it?

269
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:18,474
She'll come round.

270
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:22,144
I know she will.

271
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,080
I promise.

272
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,862
I swear it.

273
00:22:35,093 --> 00:22:36,123
Of course she will.

274
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:38,409
Of course she will.

275
00:22:39,847 --> 00:22:42,020
Why don't you go and bring her to me?

276
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:44,990
Go on.

277
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:56,667
That's the one.

278
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:58,532
Seconded from Naval Intelligence boys.

279
00:22:59,196 --> 00:23:00,667
That should do the trick.

280
00:23:00,891 --> 00:23:03,447
After all, we don't want to go charging in
like the D-day landings.

281
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,485
This could all be a wild goose chase.

282
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:07,112
It isn't.

283
00:23:07,891 --> 00:23:09,454
Yes, well...

284
00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:12,414
 UNIT High Command won't
get the British government's permission for

285
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:15,080
a full-scale assault on Sentinel 
without concrete evidence.

286
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:19,146
-Did we get the AT36?
-Yes, sir.

287
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:21,133
It's a prototype but fully tested.

288
00:23:21,296 --> 00:23:23,686
All the men have been issued with the new
high-powered ammunition.

289
00:23:24,994 --> 00:23:27,609
No reports of any trouble from
the island, sir. Not a peep.

290
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:31,422
All the same, we need to land 
somewhere quiet, uninhabited.

291
00:23:31,447 --> 00:23:32,447
Shouldn't be too difficult.

292
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,393
There's only one village on the island.

293
00:23:34,701 --> 00:23:36,021
Few outlying houses.

294
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:37,802
There should do.

295
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,956
-Very well. Carry on, Sergeant.
-Sir.

296
00:23:41,397 --> 00:23:42,918
All right, lads, let's get a move on.

297
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,469
-Have you seen Lockwood?
-Yes.

298
00:23:50,747 --> 00:23:51,747
Well, where is he?

299
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:54,622
Making a few discoveries,
I should imagine.

300
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,417
-Ah, Sentinel Island, Got it.
-Interesting?

301
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,062
-You into ley lines?
-What?

302
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:01,435
Ley lines.

303
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,914
There's one that runs 
right through the island.

304
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,316
So there is.

305
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:11,233
And there are some 
ancient burial grounds.

306
00:24:11,258 --> 00:24:13,694
You think the creature from the warehouse
is on this island?

307
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:14,885
Yes, I do.

308
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:17,600
Anything on this Alexander woman?

309
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,227
I'm looking at her record now.

310
00:24:19,252 --> 00:24:21,347
Natasha Alexander.

311
00:24:21,923 --> 00:24:23,976
-She's a psychic. 
-I know. What else?

312
00:24:24,101 --> 00:24:26,119
From the Internal Security Division.

313
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:28,717
Lockwood?

314
00:24:30,091 --> 00:24:31,028
Yes?

315
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,850
You know what the ISD do, don't you?

316
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:33,729
Yes.

317
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:36,040
Well, are they investigating 
you or what?

318
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:38,756
Perhaps.

319
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:40,202
Lockwood, what's happened?

320
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,360
What, have you, I mean, why 
would they be investigating you?

321
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:49,514
-Do they know the truth about you?
-Bound to, I suppose.

322
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:52,571
Something's going on, isn't it?

323
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:57,921
Sal, I remember.

324
00:24:59,036 --> 00:25:02,556
I did authorise the 
transport of those Autons.

325
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:06,302
-Lockwood.
-I have to go, Sal. Bye.

326
00:25:13,426 --> 00:25:14,792
Doctor Arnold.

327
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:18,910
You'd better send them in.

328
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:39,953
Charlie, it's me.

329
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,519
-Is it safe?
-Yes.

330
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,482
What happened?
Did you call the mainland?

331
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,628
Did the police take the vicar away?
What's

332
00:26:09,724 --> 00:26:11,553
It's all right.

333
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:15,179
Everything's going to be all right.

334
00:26:39,526 --> 00:26:40,766
You see, Charlie?

335
00:26:42,548 --> 00:26:44,598
Everything's going to be all right.

336
00:26:45,986 --> 00:26:47,226
Oh, my God.

337
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,856
I have a new member for our congregation.

338
00:27:41,148 --> 00:27:42,384
Thank you, Daron.

339
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:50,563
-There's no need to be afraid, Charlie.
-Who the hell are you?

340
00:27:50,588 --> 00:27:52,457
What are you doing here, 
you murdering.

341
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:55,672
What have you done to Daron?

342
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:00,600
A strong young mind.

343
00:28:01,652 --> 00:28:03,185
Just what we need.

344
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,109
Some do resist more than others.

345
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,932
Personally, I blame
it on your rather

346
00:28:30,957 --> 00:28:33,006
expensive university education.

347
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:35,798
No simple faith.

348
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:53,598
You see?

349
00:28:55,347 --> 00:28:56,932
You can't fight it.

350
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:01,775
This is something far 
older than mankind itself.

351
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:04,850
It's been waiting.

352
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,662
Now it's calling to you for help,

353
00:29:07,805 --> 00:29:09,329
and you
won't want to refuse.

354
00:29:23,988 --> 00:29:25,247
Beautiful, isn't it?

355
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:42,506
-Seems quiet enough.
-Well?

356
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:45,987
-What do you think?
-I think this is Colonel Wilson's show,

357
00:29:46,012 --> 00:29:49,105
and you, Miss Alexander, 
are his scientific advisor.

358
00:29:49,718 --> 00:29:51,559
I'm only here at Geneva's insistence.

359
00:29:55,755 --> 00:29:57,601
Ramsay, have the pilot
drop anchor, get

360
00:29:57,626 --> 00:29:59,148
the men on deck and
prepare the dinghies.

361
00:29:59,173 --> 00:29:59,862
Sir.

362
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:03,930
Let us pray.

363
00:31:57,746 --> 00:31:59,140
Don't tell me.

364
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,917
You've a feeling 
we're being watched.

365
00:32:02,031 --> 00:32:04,946
Ramsay, take one man and scout ahead.

366
00:32:05,287 --> 00:32:07,121
-Stay in contact.
-Sir.

367
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:10,309
Hargreaves, you're with me.

368
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:22,001
The soldiers must not interfere.

369
00:32:41,976 --> 00:32:43,512
Greyhound One to Greyhound Leader.

370
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:44,980
Greyhound Leader.
Go ahead.

371
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,710
No sign of anything suspicious.

372
00:32:46,974 --> 00:32:48,407
Steep incline ahead.

373
00:32:48,432 --> 00:32:49,478
Heavy woodland on top.

374
00:32:50,188 --> 00:32:52,575
Band of the Coldstream Guards could be in
there for all we know.

375
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:53,646
All right, Greyhound One.

376
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,843
Find a way up but 
exercise extreme caution.

377
00:32:56,985 --> 00:33:00,216
We have entered woodland 
and will hold this position. Over.

378
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:04,240
Take cover.

379
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:32,545
Lockwood!

380
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:35,216
What is it?

381
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,780
Autons.

382
00:34:04,716 --> 00:34:06,429
Greyhound One.
Greyhound One.

383
00:34:07,073 --> 00:34:08,073
What's happening, over?

384
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:13,469
Greyhound Leader.

385
00:34:13,748 --> 00:34:15,277
Autons firing from cover.

386
00:34:15,535 --> 00:34:16,756
Hargreaves is dead.

387
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,720
Request covering fire.

388
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:25,631
This is Greyhound Leader to all Greyhounds.
Covering fire.

389
00:34:25,656 --> 00:34:26,656
Covering fire.

390
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,442
Cease fire.
Cease fire.

391
00:34:47,527 --> 00:34:49,591
Are you all right, Ramsay?

392
00:34:50,003 --> 00:34:51,655
Just like old times, Lockwood.

393
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,955
What's the situation, Sergeant?

394
00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:56,222
They can see us.

395
00:34:56,247 --> 00:34:57,328
We can't see them.

396
00:34:57,551 --> 00:34:58,954
They've got us pinned down.

397
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,949
We must assess the 
strength of their force.

398
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:10,021
Do not allow them to leave.

399
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,310
Leave her.

400
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:51,315
-She's not important now.
-I have to go to her.

401
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:55,518
You've experienced the rapture.

402
00:35:57,159 --> 00:35:58,754
You belong with us now.

403
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:05,759
No.

404
00:36:48,747 --> 00:36:50,967
We can't make it back to the boat,
they'll cut us down.

405
00:36:51,646 --> 00:36:52,822
We need reinforcements.

406
00:36:54,074 --> 00:36:55,521
This is Greyhound Leader
to Broadsword.

407
00:36:55,678 --> 00:36:57,425
Greyhound Leader 
calling Broadsword.

408
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,118
Urgent assistance required.

409
00:36:59,237 --> 00:37:00,237
Do you read me?

410
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:03,820
You're wasting your time, Colonel.

411
00:37:04,253 --> 00:37:07,989
The last thing they're going to let us do
is call for the cavalry.

412
00:37:10,613 --> 00:37:12,135
The AT36.

413
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:14,138
Let's show them we mean business.

414
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,402
Davis, prepare the AT36.

415
00:37:30,471 --> 00:37:33,389
-Do we know if this thing works?
-Precisely.

416
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:35,816
It's strange they haven't 
moved in for the kill yet.

417
00:37:35,864 --> 00:37:37,534
All we need now is a target.

418
00:37:41,931 --> 00:37:43,961
Greyhound Four reports movement, sir.

419
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,221
Stand by.

420
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:52,684
Peek-a-boo, 
you plastic bastard.

421
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:55,144
Davis, fire.

422
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:57,701
Yes!

423
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:16,806
This isn't solving anything.

424
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:19,208
We've got to find some answers.

425
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:20,551
Haven't you got any?

426
00:38:21,107 --> 00:38:22,482
You knew they'd be here.

427
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,654
Yes, I suppose I did.

428
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:29,551
Autons are controlled
by the Nestene Consciousness.

429
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,731
We know a damaged
fragment of that escaped

430
00:38:33,756 --> 00:38:36,726
from a top security
warehouse two years ago.

431
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,770
That fragment, that creature, 
must be on this island.

432
00:38:45,076 --> 00:38:48,634
If we can find out what it's doing here, we
might at least be half-way to stopping it.

433
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:52,759
At the moment, we're falling
right into its trap by

434
00:38:52,784 --> 00:38:55,606
participating in a pointless
shoot-out we can't win.

435
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:10,094
All quiet on the Western Front.

436
00:39:12,408 --> 00:39:15,124
It seems they're not
intending to annihilate us.

437
00:39:17,493 --> 00:39:18,524
What is it?

438
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:21,439
Lockwood!

439
00:39:22,868 --> 00:39:23,868
Sir.

440
00:39:25,257 --> 00:39:26,457
Where the hell are they going?

441
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,412
-Ramsay, get them back here.
-Yes, sir.

442
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:44,297
What the hell are you doing?

443
00:39:44,513 --> 00:39:46,401
This place is crawling with Autons.

444
00:39:49,937 --> 00:39:52,707
-One of the locals.
-Perhaps with some answers.

445
00:39:52,913 --> 00:39:53,982
How did you know?

446
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,411
Oh, Lockwood.

447
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,560
Lockwood.

448
00:40:32,538 --> 00:40:33,538
Down!

449
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:35,975
No!

450
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,230
We've got to get out of here.

451
00:40:49,553 --> 00:40:50,613
The, the church.

452
00:40:51,053 --> 00:40:53,478
Something... 
Beneath the church.

453
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:55,054
What is it?

454
00:41:01,888 --> 00:41:04,379
They've cut off our retreat.
We can't get back to the others.

455
00:41:07,344 --> 00:41:08,344
Come on.

456
00:41:22,744 --> 00:41:24,434
Got any more shots 
in that thing, Davis?

457
00:41:24,643 --> 00:41:25,683
Three, sir.

458
00:41:26,509 --> 00:41:28,152
Greyhound Leader
to Greyhound One.

459
00:41:28,313 --> 00:41:30,379
Where are you?
Where are you?

460
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,955
Greyhound Leader, 
say again.

461
00:41:33,854 --> 00:41:34,874
Heavy interference.

462
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:40,929
I'm afraid the signals
it's using to control

463
00:41:40,954 --> 00:41:43,753
the Autons are jamming
our transmissions.

464
00:41:43,778 --> 00:41:44,778
It's?

465
00:41:45,347 --> 00:41:46,547
Let me get this straight.

466
00:41:46,743 --> 00:41:50,763
Are we still dealing with the blob that got
out of the air vents two years ago?

467
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,328
How did it get here?

468
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,839
Your guess is as good as mine.

469
00:41:57,358 --> 00:41:58,961
Something beneath the church.

470
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,073
What?

471
00:42:00,547 --> 00:42:02,982
That's what that girl said, 
before she died.

472
00:42:03,074 --> 00:42:04,714
What's under the church?

473
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:08,746
What's the matter?
Can't you read my mind?

474
00:42:08,807 --> 00:42:11,976
The idea of not being in control
really upsets you, doesn't it?

475
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:15,180
No. What really upsets me...

476
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:24,098
is the idea of being investigated 
by the Internal Security Division.

477
00:42:30,575 --> 00:42:32,569
You're with the ISD?

478
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,564
And you're investigating him?

479
00:42:34,717 --> 00:42:36,571
And she's apparently psychic.

480
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:37,866
When that girl looked at you,

481
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,890
she saw whatever she 
thinks is under the church here.

482
00:42:40,054 --> 00:42:41,209
Wait a minute.

483
00:42:41,983 --> 00:42:44,431
Why are you investigating Lockwood?

484
00:42:44,526 --> 00:42:45,846
He's UNIT's best operative.

485
00:42:46,718 --> 00:42:49,153
We're investigating 
him because his...

486
00:42:49,177 --> 00:42:51,177
special abilities...

487
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,856
 are a two-way street.

488
00:42:53,261 --> 00:42:55,031
Did you think your 
dreams would be exempt?

489
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,341
Dreams?

490
00:42:56,435 --> 00:42:58,363
There must have been 
a moment of contact,

491
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,625
when somehow the 
Nestene Consciousness

492
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,447
has gained a foot-hold in your mind.

493
00:43:02,571 --> 00:43:04,630
I have to know if
it's just taken up

494
00:43:04,655 --> 00:43:06,824
lodgings or whether
it's the landlord.

495
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:08,389
You're mixing your metaphors.

496
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:17,003
Don't you think we'd better 
investigate this church...

497
00:43:17,185 --> 00:43:20,451
before Colonel Wilson is 
obliged to make his last stand?

498
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,733
Well, if the church is the centre
of their operations,

499
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:26,352
that's where we've got to go.

500
00:43:29,258 --> 00:43:31,404
We knock out the blob, 
we stop the Autons, right?

501
00:43:32,282 --> 00:43:33,282
Right.

502
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:36,742
Come on.

503
00:43:38,965 --> 00:43:39,965
Of course...

504
00:43:40,862 --> 00:43:43,321
if I am working 
for the other side,

505
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,511
I may not even be aware of it.

506
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:50,013
Had you thought of that one, 
Miss Alexander?

507
00:43:50,886 --> 00:43:51,886
Oh, yes.

508
00:44:13,798 --> 00:44:14,798
Ramsay...

509
00:44:16,091 --> 00:44:17,583
I want you to go back,

510
00:44:17,923 --> 00:44:20,272
get Wilson and the rest of the men.

511
00:44:21,346 --> 00:44:22,346
No way.

512
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:23,663
Don't argue...

513
00:44:24,475 --> 00:44:25,511
Just go.

514
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,199
What is it?

515
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:33,137
Come on.

516
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,090
Lockwood.

517
00:44:48,928 --> 00:44:50,321
UNIT's creature.

518
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:52,417
At last.

519
00:44:55,748 --> 00:44:57,472
O come, all ye faithful.

520
00:45:12,013 --> 00:45:13,013
Well?

521
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:15,679
Sense of...

522
00:45:15,981 --> 00:45:17,029
Joy...

523
00:45:17,053 --> 00:45:18,785
Overwhelming rapture.

524
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:20,847
Then there's confusion...

525
00:45:21,545 --> 00:45:23,544
And loss...

526
00:45:23,944 --> 00:45:25,412
And fear.

527
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:28,571
Oh, well, that 
explains everything.

528
00:45:29,647 --> 00:45:30,679
Thank you.

529
00:45:30,758 --> 00:45:32,981
Perhaps if you hadn't shut yourself
away all your life,

530
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,163
obsessed by your own uniqueness,

531
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,619
you might be able to admit
some of those things yourself.

532
00:45:39,568 --> 00:45:40,568
I've seen them...

533
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:42,030
In black and white.

534
00:45:42,711 --> 00:45:44,564
Maybe if you could be 
honest with yourself

535
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:47,602
we might  find out what the 
Nestene Consciousness is trying to achieve.

536
00:45:49,592 --> 00:45:50,592
What's the matte...

537
00:45:51,688 --> 00:45:53,800
No sarcastic come-back
at the ready?

538
00:45:54,798 --> 00:45:55,798
No.

539
00:45:57,465 --> 00:45:59,600
You've been betrayed by 
your own people, Lockwood,

540
00:45:59,941 --> 00:46:01,541
 treated as an outsider.

541
00:46:01,877 --> 00:46:03,248
But for the first time in your life,

542
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,898
you feel as if you 
belong to...

543
00:46:06,081 --> 00:46:07,132
Something.

544
00:46:11,831 --> 00:46:16,219
I think this is the moment when
you make a run for it, Miss Alexander.

545
00:46:19,924 --> 00:46:21,065
Don't say I didn't warn you.

546
00:46:23,207 --> 00:46:24,704
Why have you brought me here?

547
00:46:24,729 --> 00:46:26,119
Oh, I think you know.

548
00:46:56,849 --> 00:46:59,167
You should have left when 
you had the chance.

549
00:46:59,595 --> 00:47:01,314
I'm keeping an eye on you.

550
00:47:01,428 --> 00:47:03,338
Your leaving was not an option...

551
00:47:06,965 --> 00:47:08,882
Natasha Alexander.

552
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:12,898
In your own way, you might be as 
helpful to us as Lockwood.

553
00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:14,269
What do you mean?

554
00:47:14,746 --> 00:47:16,617
Our good people of the island here...

555
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:18,958
Are as devoted to us...

556
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:20,632
as they can be...

557
00:47:22,016 --> 00:47:23,941
but their mental energies are,

558
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,366
without exception I'm
afraid, rather modest.

559
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,500
It's been a long, 
laborious job,

560
00:47:30,595 --> 00:47:31,724
but we're
nearly there.

561
00:47:32,706 --> 00:47:34,167
All we need now is...

562
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:35,933
A little push...

563
00:47:37,227 --> 00:47:38,303
From your...

564
00:47:39,032 --> 00:47:42,544
excellently nurtured mental powers, 
Miss Alexander...

565
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:47,488
And Lockwood's special knowledge.

566
00:47:48,716 --> 00:47:51,613
And what special 
knowledge would that be?

567
00:47:52,214 --> 00:47:53,214
Still resisting.

568
00:47:53,372 --> 00:47:55,029
Very commendable, 
Lockwood...

569
00:47:57,314 --> 00:47:58,454
but pointless.

570
00:48:00,523 --> 00:48:01,523
When we last met,

571
00:48:02,499 --> 00:48:04,699
a seed was
 planted in your mind.

572
00:48:05,864 --> 00:48:06,864
Your very...

573
00:48:07,403 --> 00:48:09,403
very special mind, Lockwood.

574
00:48:09,905 --> 00:48:11,621
You're too kind.

575
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:13,849
It's been...

576
00:48:15,278 --> 00:48:16,684
Germinating...

577
00:48:18,715 --> 00:48:20,198
and you don't
want to stop it...

578
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,000
Do you.

579
00:48:32,183 --> 00:48:34,119
What's under this church?

580
00:48:35,008 --> 00:48:36,148
What has always been...

581
00:48:37,243 --> 00:48:39,243
Since long before
the dawn of Mankind.

582
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:42,118
As Lockwood will tell you, 
we have been...

583
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,341
Colonising other planets...

584
00:48:45,516 --> 00:48:48,893
for a thousand million years.

585
00:48:53,737 --> 00:48:56,058
We Nestenes visited this world...

586
00:48:56,478 --> 00:48:58,002
and many others...

587
00:48:58,462 --> 00:49:01,246
Long before 
intelligent life evolved.

588
00:49:01,785 --> 00:49:02,785
We made...

589
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:05,381
Investments...

590
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,553
For the future.

591
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:11,714
Consequently, this ground 
has always been...

592
00:49:12,372 --> 00:49:14,372
Feared...

593
00:49:14,753 --> 00:49:15,764
Revered...

594
00:49:16,502 --> 00:49:17,709
Worshipped!

595
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,600
Many of these sites do survive,

596
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:31,079
but none so 
perfectly intact...

597
00:49:33,087 --> 00:49:34,135
As this.

598
00:49:47,506 --> 00:49:50,205
Lockwood, you've got 
to listen to me.

599
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,800
He belongs to us now.

600
00:49:55,491 --> 00:49:56,523
And so will you.

601
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:15,429
We are awakening one 
of the surviving Nestene creatures.

602
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:19,407
A beacon waiting to be ignited.

603
00:50:19,658 --> 00:50:21,928
Through it we shall 
bring the  entire

604
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,952
Nestene Consciousness to Earth.

605
00:50:25,074 --> 00:50:26,529
Opposition will be...

606
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:30,221
-Impossible.
-Lockwood, can't you see what you're doing?

607
00:50:30,363 --> 00:50:34,159
With Lockwood's knowledge of all UNIT's
plans for combating alien invasion...

608
00:50:34,766 --> 00:50:35,766
We will be...

609
00:50:36,941 --> 00:50:38,133
Invincible.

610
00:50:49,585 --> 00:50:50,577
No!

611
00:51:12,962 --> 00:51:15,217
You said it would be 
me leading the prayer.

612
00:51:17,531 --> 00:51:20,062
That I would 
bring him back to us.

613
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:23,974
Are you all right?

614
00:52:31,422 --> 00:52:32,822
We've succeeded, Lockwood.

615
00:53:06,807 --> 00:53:10,088
It won't be long before 
contact is established.

616
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:12,632
The entire Nestene Consciousness?

617
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,160
Lockwood, you've got to stop it.

618
00:53:15,185 --> 00:53:18,467
They're uploading every scrap 
of information you have access to.

619
00:53:18,665 --> 00:53:21,081
You're going to leave the 
Earth open to invasion.

620
00:53:22,443 --> 00:53:23,443
They'll destroy us all!

621
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,720
But not Lockwood.

622
00:53:25,395 --> 00:53:27,093
He'll live on in the Consciousness.

623
00:53:27,784 --> 00:53:28,784
He'll belong.

624
00:53:29,061 --> 00:53:30,566
He's nothing in 
common with you...

625
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,149
Or the rest
of your race.

626
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,620
What the hell happened here?

627
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:06,201
Get down.

628
00:54:06,657 --> 00:54:08,531
Davis, prepare to give 
it your last shot.

629
00:54:08,556 --> 00:54:09,643
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

630
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:14,613
Sergeant, where the 
hell have you been?

631
00:54:14,744 --> 00:54:15,744
We've got to move fast, sir.

632
00:54:15,902 --> 00:54:17,395
Lockwood and Natasha are in trouble.

633
00:54:17,616 --> 00:54:18,616
They can't be.

634
00:54:18,736 --> 00:54:19,736
What sort of trouble?

635
00:54:21,807 --> 00:54:22,807
That kind of trouble.

636
00:54:27,894 --> 00:54:29,977
Listen to me, 
you stubborn old bastard.

637
00:54:30,284 --> 00:54:31,788
Don't let that
smooth-talking piece

638
00:54:31,813 --> 00:54:33,434
of plastic let you
wallow in self-pity.

639
00:54:33,823 --> 00:54:35,423
Look into my mind.

640
00:54:35,935 --> 00:54:37,826
I know what it's like 
to be the outsider...

641
00:54:38,127 --> 00:54:40,127
but we make 
ourselves outsiders.

642
00:54:40,545 --> 00:54:42,345
The trick is to let people in.

643
00:54:42,855 --> 00:54:44,555
Lockwood, 
I'm letting you in.

644
00:54:45,203 --> 00:54:46,203
You've got to stop...

645
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:22,870
What have you done?

646
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:35,498
What have you done?

647
00:56:00,347 --> 00:56:01,347
What have I done?

648
00:56:04,767 --> 00:56:06,329
You're not off the hook yet.

649
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,138
I haven't finished my investigation.

650
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:36,315
-All right?
-Thank you.

651
00:56:39,204 --> 00:56:41,139
Have you finished 
your investigation?

652
00:56:41,752 --> 00:56:42,752
No.

653
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,180
I'll leave you to it, then.

654
00:56:51,648 --> 00:56:53,266
He's the soul of discretion.

655
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:54,893
Where did that creature go?

656
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,260
It hasn't gone, has it?

657
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,690
