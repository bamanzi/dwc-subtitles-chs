1
00:00:44,207 --> 00:00:45,696
It's you.

2
00:00:45,858 --> 00:00:48,388
The phantom piper!

3
00:00:48,555 --> 00:00:50,479
No!

4
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:53,546
No! I'll not go with you!

5
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:56,721
Do you hear me, piper? No! Leave me!

6
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,742
Leave me. I'll not go with you, do you hear me?

7
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,723
Leave me! No, I'll not go with you!

8
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:06,874
I'll fight you every inch of the way.

9
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:09,041
I'll not go with you.

10
00:01:16,257 --> 00:01:18,261
Leave me, piper.

11
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:22,416
No. Leave me. I'll not go.

12
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,964
Agh!

13
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:32,680
- What's happened?
- It was horrible!

14
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:37,587
- A giant creature like a Cyberman!
- It's all right. Don't be frightened.

15
00:01:37,758 --> 00:01:41,537
- It's gone now.
- The Cyberman was carrying a patient.

16
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:45,162
- Cyberman? What are you talking about?
- I'm sure it was.

17
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:47,217
It's OK. Take it easy.

18
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:50,438
She's right.
There's another one gone.

19
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:55,747
Sam, Jules, you've got to find these men.
They can't just disappear.

20
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:59,410
Search every square inch
till you find them. Now move.

21
00:02:02,077 --> 00:02:05,811
Now, supposing you tell me your story?
What did you see?

22
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,112
I went out to get Jamie some water,

23
00:02:09,284 --> 00:02:15,400
and when I came back,
I saw this giant man or creature or something,

24
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:20,147
just going out of the door,
carrying a patient... like a doll.

25
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:23,970
- I think it was a Cyberman.
- Forget that part. Then what?

26
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:28,560
Then nothing.
The door shut, and then you came in.

27
00:02:30,503 --> 00:02:34,523
- What do you know about all this?
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

28
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:36,855
We'll see about that in a minute.

29
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:41,126
- This thing you saw. What was it like?
- It was enormous, and silver.

30
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,787
- It had holes in its head for eyes, like a robot.
- A robot?

31
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:48,210
But the Cybermen were all killed
when Mondas blew up.

32
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:53,694
Stop this Cyberman nonsense! There were
Cybermen, but they were destroyed ages ago!

33
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:56,547
- So we all thought.
- That's enough.

34
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:59,005
Let's have a little calm thinking.

35
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:04,356
For the past two weeks,
an unknown disease has appeared in the base.

36
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:08,786
People drop in their tracks
and develop a black pattern on their skin.

37
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,879
Then patients disappear.

38
00:03:12,177 --> 00:03:17,444
They can't leave the base without spacesuits,
and there are no spacesuits missing.

39
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:21,311
- It does sound a little odd.
- More than a little.

40
00:03:21,477 --> 00:03:26,299
I do know one thing - a new disease starts,
people disappear, then you turn up.

41
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,043
You think we did it!
We haven't done a thing!

42
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:34,074
I don't know who you are,
what you are, or where you came from,

43
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:36,291
but you can get off the moon now!

44
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:39,753
That suits me fine!
We can't go yet.

45
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:44,866
- Why not? They don't want us here.
- There is something evil here. We must stay.

46
00:03:45,032 --> 00:03:48,329
- Evil? Don't be daft!
- Evil is what I meant.

47
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:53,682
There are some corners of the universe
which have bred the most terrible things.

48
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,911
Things which act against everything
that we believe in. They must be fought.

49
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:04,672
This disease, for instance. It isn't really
a disease at all, but I can help you with it.

50
00:04:04,842 --> 00:04:08,173
You'll see. I'll find the cause for you.

51
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:12,204
- Will you, indeed?
- Yes. I just need to examine a few things.

52
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:15,783
- It should be simple.
- Well, I'm not sure.

53
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:20,664
I'll give you just one Earth-day cycle
to find the cause.

54
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:22,716
- Earth what?
- 24 hours.

55
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,292
- But that's no time at all.
- It's all you're going to get.

56
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:29,520
Then you get off the moon,
with this bloke here.

57
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:32,696
- You can't move him! He's very ill.
- We accept.

58
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:36,484
Now tell me, you have pathological
equipment here, yes?

59
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,472
Yes. Evans was working on
an extensive research project. It's all in here.

60
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:46,991
It's quite a small unit. We're not equipped
to deal with a full-scale epidemic.

61
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:51,053
- Do you think you can manage?
- Yes.

62
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:56,379
Right. I'll leave you to it.
Don't forget - 24 hours.

63
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:07,122
- What are you going to do, Doctor?
- We'll start with this one.

64
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:12,879
- Are you really a medical doctor?
- Yes, I think I was once, Polly.

65
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:16,861
I think I took a degree once, in Glasgow.

66
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:22,023
1888, I think. Lister. Hold that for me, will you?

67
00:05:24,443 --> 00:05:27,821
- Oh!
- All right. He's quite unconscious.

68
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:37,196
- What can we do to help?
- I shall need to examine everything.

69
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:43,403
Clothes, boots, food, towels, soap -
everything. Will you get them for me, please?

70
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:47,828
- Have you any idea what it might be?
- No. Not an idea.

71
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:49,520
But we'll find it out.

72
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:09,129
I don't understand it. I'm sure
there's a lack of co-ordination somewhere.

73
00:06:09,297 --> 00:06:12,515
- Yes, but where?
- On the indicators. Look!

74
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:16,905
- It should be steady as a rock.
- The fault must be in the Gravitron.

75
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:19,679
- Nils, here.
- Yes.

76
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:24,633
Move the probe. We'll see if the indicators
move the right distance on the map.

77
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:28,371
- Keep an eye on the probe itself, will you?
- OK.

78
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:31,236
- All yours.
- Right.

79
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:47,182
Deflect probe five degrees... now.

80
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:57,966
Way off. Five degrees should put them
over Iceland. Move the probe back again.

81
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:03,805
The probe deflects all right.

82
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:09,002
The fault's here. This could be a disaster
if we can't stabilise the Earth's field.

83
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,903
If we lose that hurricane,
all hell will break loose on Earth.

84
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:16,167
- I have a wife and family.
- You're not the only one.

85
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:19,107
Roget, check the potentiometers.

86
00:07:19,276 --> 00:07:22,494
Nils, check the gravitation units.

87
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:25,955
Shake it up.
We haven't got much time.

88
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,540
- The field is stabilising at 48, Mr Hobson.
- Prepare to move probe.

89
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,714
Check co-ordinates.

90
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:42,585
We've got to hold that hurricane in the Pacific.

91
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:45,967
Stand by... Now!

92
00:07:58,774 --> 00:08:00,778
20-degree tilt complete.

93
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:03,639
The field's not correcting.

94
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:11,892
- We'll have to increase the reactor power.
- You can't do that. The torus will burn out.

95
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:13,389
It's all we can do.

96
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:19,185
<i>International Space Control.
Earth calling Moon Weather Control. Stand by.</i>

97
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,594
This is Moonbase. Come in, please.

98
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:26,269
<i>- We wish to speak to Mr Hobson.
- Hobson speaking.</i>

99
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:32,150
<i>- Stand by for the Controller.
- He's actually going to speak to us this time!</i>

100
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:36,092
<i>Controller Rinberg speaking.</i>

101
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:39,961
<i>- Is that you, Hobson?
- Yes, Rinberg.</i>

102
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,663
<i>The directional fields are showing
a progressive error.</i>

103
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,330
<i>There are widespread pressure fluctuations
in Atlantic Zone 6.</i>

104
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,397
<i>You must get the Gravitron back into balance.</i>

105
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,019
We're trying to compensate
by realigning the probe.

106
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:57,508
We have an error in the servos.

107
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,692
<i>Well, there's no sign
of any improvement here.</i>

108
00:09:00,861 --> 00:09:03,713
<i>We've just had a report from Miami, Florida.</i>

109
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:08,381
<i>30 minutes ago, they were enjoying
clear skies and a heatwave.</i>

110
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:11,563
<i>Now Hurricane Lucy is right overhead.</i>

111
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:15,958
- The only thing we can do is shut it down.
- Switch the Gravitron off?

112
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:19,453
- It's the only chance.
- The collapse of the gravity

113
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:21,708
would devastate half the globe.

114
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,379
<i>- There'd be storms, hurricanes...
- I overheard your conversation.</i>

115
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:28,152
<i>It's out of the question.</i>

116
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:33,554
<i>You're not to shut down the Gravitron
under any circumstances. That's an order.</i>

117
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:40,673
<i>Perhaps you don't appreciate
how serious the situation already is.</i>

118
00:09:40,843 --> 00:09:42,847
I bet he gets a knighthood

119
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:49,213
<i>We spent years negotiating methods
of agreement between farmers and landowners.</i>

120
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,192
<i>Now the weather's out of control,
they're after our blood.</i>

121
00:09:53,365 --> 00:10:00,087
<i>I must say, I can't blame them. You've
got to get that thing under control - quickly.</i>

122
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,254
<i>Now please get on with it.</i>

123
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:04,795
<i>Earth Control over and out.</i>

124
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:09,748
Well, we've got trouble. Bad trouble.
We haven't got much time.

125
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:15,262
We're going to run through every circuit,
every field pattern, every nut and bolt

126
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,441
until Charlie boy's running sweet and smooth.

127
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:24,406
You all know what to do. Let's get on with it.
We'll start on the main tape programme.

128
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:35,197
It's running now.

129
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,692
Give me the analogue value
on module six, will you?

130
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:41,474
They look all right.

131
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,046
A at ten millivolts.

132
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:46,223
B at 15 millivolts.

133
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:51,500
- C at 26. That fits, doesn't it?
- Yes, they're at normal levels.

134
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:56,248
Finish checking here, will you?
The answer may be in the control panel.

135
00:10:56,418 --> 00:11:00,999
I'll sing out the binary conversion values.
You check them on readout.

136
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:03,174
Channel one.

137
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:05,348
- Eight...
- Right.

138
00:11:05,518 --> 00:11:07,522
- One.
- Mm.

139
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:09,696
- Three. Four.
- Yeah.

140
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:13,245
- Six. Eight. Twelve.
- Yeah.

141
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,379
All spot-on.

142
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:20,892
Qu'est-ce que vous fabriquez ici? Vous croyez
que nous sommes en train de nous amuser?

143
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,999
<i>- Come on. Get out of the way!
- Enchanté, monsieur</i>

144
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:28,177
Now, where were we?

145
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:33,409
Ah, yes, the fluid servo primers.
I reckon this is probably where the fault is.

146
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:36,879
- Do you want them all?
- The main tank will do.

147
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:41,070
- Header one. 45 pounds.
- Yes.

148
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:43,075
- Header two. 47.
- Yes.

149
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,249
- Three. 42.
- Yes.

150
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:49,236
Sine values equivalent.

151
00:11:49,406 --> 00:11:52,703
They all fit. Nothing there.

152
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:55,880
It must be the potentiometer net, then.

153
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:01,076
It'll take us some time to do that.
We'll need the digital voltmeter.

154
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,945
What the blazes are you doing?

155
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:09,207
- I'm collecting specimens.
- Specimens?

156
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:11,426
Oh, yes... Well, get on with it.

157
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:19,476
We're nearly out of this interferon stuff.

158
00:12:19,644 --> 00:12:22,975
- You'd better ask Mr Hobson where the rest is.
- Right.

159
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:34,292
It's all right, Jamie. It's all right.
You're going to get better but you must lie still.

160
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:38,033
What is this place?
Is it the home of the piper?

161
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:41,583
No, we're on the moon.
You know, the moon up in the sky.

162
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:43,592
No, I can't be alive.

163
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,086
I've just seen the piper.

164
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:08,441
The piper! I knew!

165
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:43,634
Polly! What's happened?

166
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,088
Polly.

167
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:48,381
Are you all right?

168
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:06,983
Anything out on the probe servers?

169
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:10,205
There's a slight discrepancy... in normal limits.

170
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:14,182
- Check the overall feedback valve.
- That's an idea.

171
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:19,058
I don't think it's likely to be a mechanical fault.

172
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:23,040
An air pressure drop again.
Lasts about five seconds.

173
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:29,122
Something's odd. It's not the pumps.
Has anyone asked permission to leave the base?

174
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:31,777
No. The compression chamber's empty.

175
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:36,176
If anybody's been fooling about in there,
I'll tear the hides off them!

176
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,442
- The pressure's up again now, sir.
- Thank heaven.

177
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:09,997
- I'll check over the control loop monitor.
- You're wasting your time.

178
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:13,413
Nothing's a waste of time till we trace this fault!

179
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:18,565
You saw what's happening on Earth.
We can't afford to miss anything. Get on with it!

180
00:15:18,737 --> 00:15:22,471
I've found something.
It's one of the probe control antennae.

181
00:15:22,643 --> 00:15:27,188
- What's wrong with it?
- Two pieces are missing. It's not co-ordinating.

182
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:29,358
- Missing?
- Meteorites?

183
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:33,227
Could be. There could be a simpler explanation.

184
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:36,448
When did these people arrive here?

185
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:40,397
The end of period 11 in this present lunar day.

186
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,866
- When did the Gravitron start playing up?
- The beginning of period 12.

187
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:49,049
- When was the last time anyone was outside?
- During period 13.

188
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:52,068
- Two men realigned a solar mirror.
- That's it!

189
00:15:52,237 --> 00:15:54,401
- I'm not with you.
- It's simple.

190
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:56,335
Strangers arrive period 11.

191
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:59,802
- The Gravitron fails period 12.
- I understand, but...

192
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:04,792
It's time we put that Doctor and his friend
in cold storage.

193
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,670
Just a second. Get two men outside
to look at the antennae, will you?

194
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:15,865
Joe, tell Jules and Franz
I want them here pretty sharpish.

195
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:18,689
- What is it?
- Another patient's gone, sir.

196
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:20,775
What?! Come on!

197
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:30,600
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

198
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:34,942
- Isn't there any clue at all?
- No. It's a complete blank.

199
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:40,459
All the tests are negative. As far as I can see,
this whole ridiculous place is sterile.

200
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:46,861
- We'll have to tell Mr Hobson, I suppose.
- I simply don't understand it.

201
00:17:47,874 --> 00:17:51,940
Doctor, it couldn't have
anything to do with Lister, could it?

202
00:17:52,102 --> 00:17:54,507
- Lister?
- Well, I mean, you did say

203
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:57,691
that you took your degree in Glasgow in 1888.

204
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,471
That's an awfully long time from now, 2070.

205
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,814
Are you saying that I'm not confident
to carry out these tests?

206
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:10,094
No, I just wondered if there was anything
that Joseph Lister didn't know in 1888

207
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:14,567
- that might help you now.
- Ssh! Somebody's coming!

208
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:19,155
It's Mr Hobson. Out for blood - ours. Look busy!

209
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,740
That's the third person
to disappear in the past few hours.

210
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,647
- It's completely illogical.
- Do you mind?

211
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:32,238
Would you mind standing away from the door
and allowing it to close? The slides. The dust!

212
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,737
It must be you people.
We've got some straight talking to do, you and I.

213
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:43,272
- Polly. Another boot.
- Do you hear me?

214
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:47,091
- This is extraordinary.
- Excuse me, please.

215
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:51,286
- Look here...
- Excuse me. We ARE trying to help you.

216
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:55,677
- Help? You can all get off the moon now.
- You said...

217
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,808
- I don't care what I said!
- Ah!

218
00:18:57,974 --> 00:19:01,305
- Have you found something?
- I think perhaps I have.

219
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:07,265
Yes, I may be onto something,
but I must have some room.

220
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:12,177
How can I work under these conditions?
Outside. I'm trying to work in here!

221
00:19:12,348 --> 00:19:15,920
- Ben, see that they stay outside.
- Did you mean that?

222
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:18,256
- What?
- You've found something?

223
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:21,964
Oh, Polly, I only wish I had.

224
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,879
Keep them happy with coffee
while I think of something.

225
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:29,048
All right.

226
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:07,024
Here, Doctor.

227
00:20:07,992 --> 00:20:10,477
- Completed your examination?
- Yes.

228
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,589
- Have you poked into everything?
- Yes, clothes, boots, food.

229
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:17,573
- And you've found...
- Absolutely nothing.

230
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:21,756
Just as I thought, so what I told you still stands.

231
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:24,133
Ah, coffee. Splendid.

232
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,837
Thank you, Polly.
I think we could all do with a cup!

233
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:30,374
See how Jules and Franz are getting on.

234
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,063
Right.

235
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:41,688
Coffee? Sugar?
Thank you.

236
00:20:43,747 --> 00:20:47,365
- It's very hot. Doctor, what about you?
- Thank you, Polly.

237
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:52,558
Doctor, as I was saying, you've had
your chance and come up with nothing.

238
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:00,937
Don't touch him!

239
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,589
Let me look.

240
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:16,761
Charlie and you, Ben,
give us a hand to get him into the medical unit.

241
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:19,408
Try not to touch his skin.

242
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:40,713
Don't drink that! It's the sugar!

243
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:46,550
That's why the disease doesn't affect everyone.
It's the sugar. Not everyone takes it.

244
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,723
Don't touch it.

245
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,183
- What are you doing?
- Just be patient.

246
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:17,720
Just as I thought.

247
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:21,419
A large neurotropic virus.

248
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:24,165
- Like the space plague?
- No.

249
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:28,104
It's a large infective agent
that only attacks the nerves.

250
00:22:28,271 --> 00:22:33,620
Lines appear on faces and hands where it
follows the course of the nerves under the skin.

251
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:35,757
How did it get in here?

252
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:40,788
It is the Cybermen. I believe
they have deliberately infected the base.

253
00:22:40,955 --> 00:22:45,902
We've searched the base. There's no space
to hide a cat, let alone a Cyberman.

254
00:22:46,068 --> 00:22:48,518
Anyhow, how did they get in?

255
00:22:49,732 --> 00:22:51,977
- One moment.
- What is it?

256
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,380
- You say you searched all the base?
- Yes. What of it?

257
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,729
- No chance of anyone hiding anywhere?
- None whatever.

258
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:06,955
Did your men search in here? Did they?

259
00:23:07,126 --> 00:23:10,183
- People were in here, so...
- Did they search in here?

260
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:14,366
- No.
- There's nowhere in here they could hide.

261
00:23:45,497 --> 00:23:49,070
Oh, no!
Back!

262
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:50,844
Back.
