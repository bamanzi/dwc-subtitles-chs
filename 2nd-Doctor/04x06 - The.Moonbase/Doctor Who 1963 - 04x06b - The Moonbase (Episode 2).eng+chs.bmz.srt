你会看到, 我会帮你们找到原因

<i>Now the weather's out of control,
they're after our blood.</i>
现在天气失控了, 他们会要我们的命的

124
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:59,487
<i>I must say, I can't blame them.
You've got to get that thing under control - quickly.</i>
我得说, 我不怪他们．你们得把那个东西回归可控状态 - 要快

125
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,654
<i>Now please get on with it.</i>
现在请去干吧

126

<i>Earth Control over and out.</i>
地球控制中心结束退出

127
00:10:04,361 --> 00:10:09,148
Now you're all in the picture. Well, we've got trouble.
Bad trouble. We haven't got much time.
现在, 整体情况大家都知道了．我们有了麻烦, 大麻烦．我们没有太多时间

128
00:10:09,314 --> 00:10:14,662
We're going to run through every circuit,
every field pattern, every nut and bolt
我要去检查每个线路, 每个域模式, 每个螺母和螺栓

129
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,841
until Charlie boy's running sweet and smooth.
A full class A test, in fact.
直到那玩意儿重新欢快平顺地跑起来．事实上, 要做一次完整的A级测试

130
00:10:18,011 --> 00:10:23,806
You all know what to do. Let's get on with it.
We'll start on the main tape programme.
你们都知道要做什么了．我们开始干吧．我们从主磁带程序开始

131
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:34,597
It's running now.
开始运行了

132
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,092
Give me the analogue value on module six, will you?
给我模块６的模拟数值, 好吗

133
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,874
They look all right.

00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:50,900
- C at 26. That fits, doesn't it?
- Yes, they're at normal levels.
- C 是 26．这没问题, 是吧?  - 是的, 他们都在正常水平

137
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:55,648
Finish checking here, will you?
The answer may be in the control panel.
你完成这里的检查, 行吗？答案也许在控制面板上

138
00:10:55,818 --> 00:11:00,399
I'll sing out the binary conversion values.
You check them on readout.
我来唱读二元转换读书, 你负责核对

139
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:02,574
Channel one.
第一通道

140
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:04,748
- Eight...   - Right.
- 八...  - 对

141
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:06,922
- One.    - Mm.

All spot-on.
都没问题

145
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:20,292
Qu'est-ce que vous fabriquez ici? Vous croyez
que nous sommes en train de nous amuser?
(法语)

146
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,399
<i>- Come on. Get out of the way!
- Enchant, monsieur</i>
- 嘿, 别在这里碍事  - ... (法语)

147
00:11:25,573 --> 00:11:27,577
Now, where were we?
现在, 我们到哪儿了

148
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:32,809
Ah, yes, the fluid servo primers.
I reckon this is probably where the fault is.
啊, 是了, 流体伺服器油泵．我觉得这可能是问题所在了

149
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:36,279
- Do you want them all?
- The main tank will do.
- 所有你都要吗？  - 主箱的就行了

150
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:40,470

152
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:44,649
- Three. 42.
- Yes.
- 三号枪, 42  - 好

153
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,636
Sine values equivalent.

154
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:52,103
They all fit. Nothing there.
都没问题, 没啥了

155
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:55,280
It must be the potentiometer net, then.
那就肯定是电位计了

156
00:11:55,449 --> 00:12:00,476
It'll take us some time to do that.
We'll need the digital voltmeter.
这要费点时间, 我们需要数字电压表

157
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:05,345
What the blazes are you doing?
你到底在搞什么鬼啊

158
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:08,607
- I'm collecting specimens.
- Specimens?
- 我在采集样本  - 样本？

159
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:10,826
Oh, yes... Well, get on with it.
哦, 是了...好了, 干吧

160
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:18,876
We're nearly out of this interferon stuff.
这些干扰素快用完了

161
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:22,375
- You'd better ask Mr Hobson where the rest is.
- Right.
- 你最好去问问 Hobson 先生剩余的在那里  - 好

162
00:12:28,022 --> 00:12:33,692
It's all right, Jamie. It's all right.
You're going to get better but you must lie still.
没事的, Jamie, 没事．你会好起来的, 但你必须要躺好

163
00:12:33,861 --> 00:12:37,433
What is this place? Is it the home of the piper?
这是什么地方？这是风笛手的家吗？

164
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:40,983
No, we're on the moon. You know, the moon up in the sky.
不, 我们在月球上．你知道吗, 天上的月亮

165
00:12:41,148 --> 00:12:42,992
No, I can't be alive.

166
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,486
I've just seen the piper.

00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:07,841
The piper! I knew!
风笛手！我就知道！

168
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:43,034
Polly! What's happened?
Polly! 发生了什么事？

169
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,488
Polly.

170
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:47,781
Are you all right?
你没事吧？

171
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:06,383
Anything out on the probe servers?
外面探针服务器有问题吗？

172
00:14:06,548 --> 00:14:09,605
There's a slight discrepancy... in normal limits.

173
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:13,582
- What about the overall feedback valve? We haven't checked it.
- That's an idea.
- 总反馈阀怎么样？我们还没检查过它
- 是个主意

174
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:18,058
You know I don't think it's likely to be a mechanical fault.
知道吗，我觉得这不太可能是机械故障

175
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:20,340
- Mr. Hobson, an air pressure drop again.
- Same as before? /20.3
- Hobson 先生，又一次出现气压了。 - 跟以前一样吗

176
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:22,440
Yes. Just the same. Lasts about five seconds.
是的, 一样，持续了大约5秒钟

177
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:26,402
Something's odd. It's not the pumps. I'm sure of that./26.4
这很奇怪，不是泵的问题。我肯定。

178
00:14:20,422 --> 00:14:28,522
Has anyone asked permission to leave the base?
有人请求离开基地吗？

179
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:31,177
No. As far as I know, the compression chamber's empty.
不。就我所知，压缩舱是空的

180
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:35,576
If I find anybody's been fooling about in there
without my permission, I'll tear the hides off them!
如果我发现谁没有得到允许就在那里面瞎搞，我要把他们的皮都撕掉!

181
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,842
- The pressure's up again now, sir.
- Thank heaven.
- 压力又回升了，头儿  - 感谢上天

182
00:15:05,011 --> 00:15:09,397
- I'll check over the control loop monitor.
- You're wasting your time.
- 我会检查控制回路监视器  - 你是在浪费时间

183
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:12,813
Nothing's a waste of time till we trace this fault!
只要能找到问题没什么是浪费时间

184
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:17,965
You saw what's happening on Earth.
We can't afford to miss anything. Get on with it!
你都看见地球上发生了什么。遗漏了什么地方我们承担不起。赶紧吧

185
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:21,871
I've found something.
It's one of the probe control antennae.
我发现点问题，是其中一个探针控制天线

186
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:26,588
- What's wrong with it?
- Two pieces are missing. It's not co-ordinating.
- 它怎么了  - 有

187
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:28,758
- Missing?
- Meteorites?

188
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,627
Could be. There could be a simpler explanation.

189
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:35,848
When did these people arrive here?

190
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:39,797
The end of period 11 in this present lunar day.

191
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,266
- When did the Gravitron start playing up?
- The beginning of period 12.

192
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:48,449
- When was the last time anyone was outside?
- During period 13.

193
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:51,468
- Two men realigned a solar mirror.
- That's it!

194
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:53,801
- I'm not with you.
- It's simple.

195
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:55,735
Strangers arrive period 11.

196
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:59,202
- The Gravitron fails period 12.
- I understand, but...

197
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:04,192
It's time we put that Doctor and his friend
in cold storage.

198
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,070
Just a second. Get two men outside
to look at the antennae, will you?

199
00:16:11,406 --> 00:16:15,265
Joe, tell Jules and Franz
I want them here pretty sharpish.

200
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,089
- What is it?
- Another patient's gone, sir.

201
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:20,175
What?! Come on!

202
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:30,000
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
没有，什么都没有

203
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:34,342
- Isn't there any clue at all?
- No. It's a complete blank.
- 一点线索也没有吗？  - 没有, 完全的空白

204
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:39,859
All the tests are negative. As far as I can see,
this whole ridiculous place is sterile.
所有测试结果都是阴性的．就我所看到的来说, 这整个破地方都是无菌的

205
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,061
- We'll have to tell Mr Hobson, I suppose.
- 我们不得不跟 Hobson 先生说了, 我想

206
00:17:43,093 --> 00:24:48,261
I don't like it very much. I simply don't understand it.
我不喜欢这个结果。我就是想不明白

207
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:51,340
Doctor, it couldn't possibly have
anything to do with Lister, could it?
博士, 这会不会跟李斯特有关, 可能吗？

208
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:53,907
- Lister?
- Well, I mean, you did say...
- 李斯特  - 这样, 我是说, 你不是说

209
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,091
that you took your degree in Glasgow in 1888.
你1888年在格拉斯哥拿到了学位

210
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,871
That's an awfully long time from now, 2070, whatever it is.
那可是一段好长的时间了, 现在是2070年了

211
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:04,214
Polly, are you suggesting that
I'm not confident to carry out these tests?
Polly, 你是不是想说我并没有能力进行这些检测？

212
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:09,494
No, No, I'm just wondering if there was anything
that Joseph Lister didn't know in 1888
不, 不, 我只是在想会不会有些什么东西是约瑟夫-李斯特在1888年不知道的

213
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:13,967
- that might help you now.
- Ssh! Somebody's coming!
- 说不定可以帮上你  - 嘘, 有人来了！

214
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:18,555
It's Mr Hobson. Out for blood - ours. Look busy! Quick!
是 Hobson 先生． 去拿血样 - 我们的．装作忙碌, 快！

215
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,140
That's the third person to disappear in the past few hours.
这是在过去几个小时内消失的第三个人了

216
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,047
- It's completely illogical.
- Do you mind?
- 这完全没逻辑  - 可以吗？

217
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:31,638
Would you mind standing away from the door
and allowing it to close? The slides. The dust!
你别站在门边可以吗, 让门可以关上？检测片. 灰尘！

218
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:40,137
It must be you people.
We've got some straight talking to do, you and I.
肯定是你的人．我们得好好谈一谈了, 你跟我

219
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:42,672
- Polly. Another boot.
- Do you hear me?
- Polly, 再来一下  - 你听到我的话了吗？

220
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:46,491
- This is extraordinary. Look here.
- Excuse me, please.
- 这真是不寻常啊, 看这里  - 借过一下, 请

221
00:18:47,388 --> 00:18:50,686
Excuse me. We ARE trying to help you.
对不起, 我们正在试图帮你忙呢

222
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:55,077
- Help? Is that what you call it? You can all get off the moon now.
- No, wait a minute. You said...
- 帮忙？你管这个叫帮忙？你们现在就可以离开月球了 - 不, 等一下, 你说过...

223
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,208
- I don't care what I said!  - Ah!
- 我不管我说过什么！  - 哈！

224
00:18:57,374 --> 00:19:00,705
- Have you found something?
- I think perhaps I have.
- 你发现什么了吗？  - 我想也许我发现了

225
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:06,665
Yes, I may be onto something, but I must have some room.
是的, 我可能找到点头绪, 但我必须得有空间

226
00:19:06,836 --> 00:19:11,577
How can I work under these conditions? Now, please,
come along. Outside. I'm trying to work in here!
在这种条件下我怎么工作？ 现在, 请过来, 外面去．我在这里尽力工作呢

227
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:15,320
- Ben, see that they stay outside.
- Did you mean that?
- Ben, 确保他们待在外面  - 你真的吗？

228
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:17,656
- What?
- You've found something?
- 什么？  - 你发现了点什么？

229
00:19:18,512 --> 00:19:21,364
Oh, Polly, I only wish I had.
哦, Polly, 我也期望我是

230
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,279
Keep them happy with coffee while I think of something.
用咖啡让他们乐呵乐呵, 我再想想怎么弄

231
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:28,448
All right.
好吧

00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:06,424
Here, Doctor.

233
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:09,877
- Completed your examination?

Just as I thought, so what I told you still stands.

Ah, coffee. Splendid.

Thank you, Polly. I think we could all do with a cup!
谢谢你, Polly．我觉得我们都需要一杯

239
00:20:27,403 --> 00:20:29,774
See how Jules and Franz are getting on.

240
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,463
Right.
好的

241
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:41,088
- Coffee? Sugar?
- Hello, Doctor. Thank you.
- 要咖啡不？ 糖？  - 你好, 博士．谢谢你

- Thank you, Polly.
- 这很热. 博士, 你要吗？ - 谢谢你, Polly

243
00:20:46,931 --> 00:20:51,958
Doctor, as I was saying, you've had your chance.
You come up with absolutely nothing.
博士, 如我之前说过的, 给过你们机会了．但你什么也没有发现

00:20:58,688 --> 00:21:00,337
Don't touch him!

Let me look.

to get him into the medical unit.

247
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:18,808
Try not to touch his skin.

248
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:40,113
Don't drink that! It's the sugar!
不要喝那个！是糖！

249
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:45,950
Don't you see? That's why the disease doesn't affect everyone.
你明白了吗？那就是为什么这个病没有感染每一个人

250
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:48,123
It's the sugar. Not everyone takes it.

00:21:49,519 --> 00:27:51,523
Don't touch it.
别碰它TS

252
