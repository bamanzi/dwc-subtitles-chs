00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,339
Anyone would think we got rats up here.

8
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:31,974
WHO IS THAT?!

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Who is it?

15
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:05,839
Doctor, do something!

16
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:07,616
I'm trying to!

17
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:23,077
Everything back under control again.

18
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:28,667
Here, we're landing! Look!

19
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:50,302
Oh, thank the lord for that. You know, Doctor,
I'll never ask you to do that again.

20
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:55,638
There must be a reason for that.

21
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:03,991
Hey, wait a mo! This doesn't look like Mars to me.

22
00:04:04,198 --> 00:04:05,933
How do you know? You never seen it.

23
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:10,359
No, Duchess, but I have seen pictures of the moon surface
and that's what this looks like.

24
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:12,024
That's the moon?

25
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,623
Doctor, is it the moon?

26
00:04:18,414 --> 00:04:22,354
Oh well, you weren't too far out, were you?
Only two hundred million miles!

27
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:27,552
All right, let's move on - while we can.

28
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:33,269
- What!
- Now wait a minute! You don't expect to land us
on the moon and let us fly off just like that, do you?

29
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:34,704
Yeah, at least let us have a look around!

30
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:38,654
That picture canna be the moon? The moon's way up in the sky.

31
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:39,925
Where do you think you're going?

32
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,508
You're not going to tell us there is no shore leave?

33
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:45,047
Oh please Doctor. The TARDIS isn't out of control or anything is it?

34
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:47,795
Oh no, no, no. Just a bumpy landing. That's all

35
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:48,934
Yeah?

36
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:52,351
Well, if you must go ashore... only half an hour.

37
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,043
- Right.
- Superb

38
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,993
You can't go ashore like that!
You need space suits, there's no atmosphere out there.

39
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:58,733
Come on, there's some in the chest.

40
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:07,221
Maybe we'll meet the old man in the moon.

41
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,330
You won't meet anybody mate if you don't get some gear on.

42
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:12,491
What? Oh aye.

43
00:05:26,948 --> 00:05:29,094
Hey, look at this.

44
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:30,862
Its deserted.

45
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:32,638
Yeah, I don't think I like it.

46
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,063
Hey, what do we need this great clogs for?

47
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:39,008
Try a little jump.

48
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:41,547
All right.

49
00:05:57,717 --> 00:06:01,893
Careful! One tear in that space suit and you'll suffocate.

50
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,082
Come on, it's easy.

51
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,474
Look out, here I come.

52
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:16,482
Where's he gone?

53
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,447
Over there.

54
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:27,124
What on Earth? Look!

55
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:28,872
Blimey! What is it?

56
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:30,348
Doctor, what is it?

57
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:31,932
I don't know.

58
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:33,945
Hey, I can see Jamie, there he is.

59
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:36,613
Hey, there's somebody coming out.

60
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:39,360
Come on, let's go.

61
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,744
And... Jules, you take over.

62
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:28,015
There must be some source to this infection.

63
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,215
Look, then get the lads in here and tell them what's happening.

64
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:31,915
Get them on the blower would you, Nils.

65
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,865
Hello. Where did you lot spring from? /

66
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,765
Don't tell me the shuttle rocket arrived already?

67
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:43,689
No, it hasn't.

68
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:47,815
There was another one with them, sir.
Bob taken him along to the Medical unit.

69
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:49,815
He's all right. He's just knocked himself out or something.

70
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,191
Oh no, if we haven't got enough troubles already.

71
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:55,990
We don't want to cause you any trouble.
Just let us collect our young friend and we'll be off.

72
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,795
Hey, not so fast.

73
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,696
Please let me go and see Jamie.

74
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,849
I will take you there Mademoiselle. If you come with me.

75
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,301
All right, young lady. You can carry on.

76
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,589
This way.

77
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:10,474
Well, you know what this place is?

78
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:15,054
Well, it looks like some sort of weather control centre.

79
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:19,529
Ah, yes. And that's the thing with which
you control the weather. That's the culprit then.

80
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:20,414
Hey?

81
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:23,337
Hmmm. That's what gave us a bumpy landing.

82
00:08:23,343 --> 00:08:24,174
- Hm-Hmm.
- I see

83
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:27,943
The gravitron controls the tides, the tides controls the weather.

84
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:30,949
And from this console we can plot it all on that map.

85
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:32,557
Simple, eh?

86
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,150
Yeah, very simple.

87
00:08:42,294 --> 00:08:44,443
It's Jim. Quick Francois, take over.

88
00:08:57,438 --> 00:09:02,407
International Space Control Earth calling
Weather Control Moon - come in please.

89
00:09:02,597 --> 00:09:03,786
Moonport - standing by.

90
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:06,471
Ever seen anything like that before, Doctor?

91
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:07,479
Hobson here.

92
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:17,074
What's happening up there? The hurricane you were guiding
is now 45 degrees off course. It's threatening Hawaii.

93
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:20,533
One of my men were taken ill. We're operational again now.

94
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,418
The controller would like to know the cause of the illness.

95
00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:29,633
Yes, so would we. We now have three men down

96
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:33,233
with this mysterious virus in the past few hours
- including the Doctor.

97
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:39,478
One moment please. Stand by for further instructions.

98
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:46,137
Just hang on for another couple of minutes lads.
We better hear what the great Mr. Rinberg has to say.

99
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:47,582
We're being monitored again.

100
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:48,733
Monitored?

101
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:54,274
Someone, not too far away from the base,
is listening to every word we say.

102
00:09:55,885 --> 00:10:00,738
"Moonbase, Moonbase, come in Moonbase. "

103
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:02,566
Still standing by.

104
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:07,389
If you radio information about this virus,

105
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:10,589
we can do our best to identify it and suggest treatment.

106
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:13,164
I demand to speak to Rinberg.

107
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:20,580
The controller is busy - I'm sorry. Over and out.

108
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:26,522
That whole conversion was monitored by someone or something.

109
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:30,250
Oh, never mind about that now.
That Rinberg fellow won't talk to you.

110
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:34,250
How can we trace down this mystery illness
with the Doctor himself down with it.

111
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:38,391
We better get out of these things and see how Jamie is.
Perhaps I can be of help in the sick bay now.

112
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,242
Anything you can do... Bob!

113
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:41,385
Yes, Mr Hobson?

114
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:42,694
Show them to the Medical unit will you?

115
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,021
Yes, of course. Now, if you will come this way, please?

116
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:46,974
Yes. Thank you.

117
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:54,452
Well, you all heard the position. We don't know
what this infection is and how it got into the base

118
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:58,452
but I want you all to take extra precautions
while this emergency is on

119
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:01,952
We may be short-handed for quite a while.

120
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:03,282
Is this how its goes, Doctor?

121
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:08,607
Yes, that's right. Then, this unit automatically
controls the pulse, the temperature and the breathing.

122
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:10,161
A sort of electronic Doctor.

123
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,210
Yes.

124
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:12,832
And it even give you medicines too?

125
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:14,888
Yes. It will do very nearly everything.

126
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:16,667
How do you think he is, Doctor?

127
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,392
Oh, he's not too bad. He's a bit concussed
and feverish but he'll be all right with rest.

128
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:26,161
The Piper! The McCrimmon Piper! Don't let him get me!

129
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:27,246
Piper?

130
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:34,334
Some legend of his clan. As far, as I can make out
- this piper appears to a McCrimmon just before he dies.

131
00:11:34,473 --> 00:11:36,749
Has this phantom piper appeared to Jamie yet?

132
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,368
You don't believe it, do you?

133
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:40,754
No, but he does. It's important to him.

134
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:43,412
He keeps asking us to keep the piper away from him.

135
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:46,756
Good. We can see if we can do just that.

136
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,216
Well, carry on Nurse.

137
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:55,531
Well, at least I try to help. There's a ward full of sick men
and no doctor. Somebody got to do something.

138
00:11:58,494 --> 00:11:59,555
I wonder who this is?

139
00:11:59,815 --> 00:12:02,886
Don't get too near. Have a look on his chart.

140
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:04,645
That's a good idea.

141
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:05,897
It's Dr. Evans.

142
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,837
Oh, yes. The station doctor. He was the first one to get it.

143
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,604
He looks one of the worst.

144
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,150
There's something about this epidemic
that I... I just don't understand.

145
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:19,150
It's not like a real disease at all! It's almost like...

146
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:20,980
Not real! What more do you want?

147
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:25,350
I don't know. But there are certain signs and symptoms
which don't add up.

148
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,214
Ben, I want you to go to the control room and keep an eye on things.

149
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,093
But how?

150
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:32,610
Give a hand, do anything but keep your eyes and ears open.

151
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:33,494
Right.

152
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:37,087
There's something very wrong here. Something very wrong indeed.

153
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:48,063
Still up, Nobby. Why not take a rest. Go and get some sleep.

154
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:53,334
Oh, How can I rest with that thing up the spout.
You know the score as well as I do.

155
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:56,834
Five units off centre and we lift half London into space!

156
00:12:56,954 --> 00:12:59,934
Five more and the Atlantic water level goes up three feet!

157
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:03,334
Rinberg don't understand the pressure we're under.

158
00:13:03,436 --> 00:13:06,497
Hey you! What do you thinking you are doing?! Skulking here?

159
00:13:06,692 --> 00:13:08,690
Just wondering if I can help, sir.

160
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,064
Well, how can you help?

161
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,570
We can do with an extra pair of hands - he can help me.

162
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:14,665
Well, keep him away from me, that's all.

163
00:13:14,763 --> 00:13:17,165
All right, I'll go and lie down. Call me if anything happens.

164
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,240
Yes, of course.

165
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:23,251
Oh, by the way, there were two more of those momentary drops
in air pressure while I was on.

166
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:24,151
I have put them in the log.

167
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,097
Right.

168
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:27,554
What is that?

169
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:32,829
Shhhh, it's all right Polly. It's only me.
We don't want to wake everybody up do we?

170
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:41,140
You look if you can do with some sleep yourself.

171
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:44,285
I'm all right.

172
00:13:44,544 --> 00:13:45,868
What have you got there?

173
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:48,258
Oh, I been doing a little investigation.

174
00:13:48,874 --> 00:13:50,929
A piece of silver paper. What is it?

175
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:51,988
I don't know.

176
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:53,714
What's happened?!

177
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:56,951
Oh, it's nothing. It probably just a changeover in the time cycle.

178
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,518
What do you mean?

179
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:01,314
Oh, you see - it's rather interesting really

180
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:05,314
you see on the moon, they have a fortnight of days
and a fortnight of nights.

181
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:06,282
Well?

182
00:14:06,653 --> 00:14:11,099
Well, it's oblivious isn't it? They have to
make their own day and night artificially up there

183
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:13,799
Or it would upset their own biological time clock.

184
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:15,074
Their what?

185
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,876
They won't know if they were coming or going. Get it?

186
00:14:19,137 --> 00:14:20,023
Yes.

187
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:23,825
Clever girl. QED. That's why it's dark up here.

188
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:27,277
Oh, I see what you mean. Yes, of course. How stupid of me.

189
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:30,714
Of course along the control centre it's probably broad daylight.

190
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,793
Polly, you wouldn't be making fun of me would you?

191
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:35,057
No.

192
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,372
Dr. Evans.

193
00:14:40,098 --> 00:14:53,471
The hand. No, don't touch me. No. The silver hand.

194
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:04,945
Doctor, is he...

195
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:09,382
Yes, I'm afraid he is.

196
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:19,418
What are we gone to do?

197
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:24,488
What does he means by the silver hand.
I better report this to Mr. Hobson.

198
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:48,205
What's the matter?

199
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:50,329
Something just went out of that door!

200
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:51,817
Nils! John!

201
00:15:51,986 --> 00:15:53,051
What was it?

202
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:00,630
Nothing. Nothing there.

203
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:10,295
Your nerves are getting the better of you. Where's Evan's body?

204
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:11,521
Over there.

205
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,402
All right, let's get it over with.

206
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:29,679
Is this somebody's idea of a particularly bad joke?

207
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:31,285
This is no joke, believe me!

208
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:33,456
Mr. Hobson, Mr. Hobson, you are wanted!

209
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:37,856
Another man's collapsed at the controls
and the Gravitron has been thrown off alignment again.

210
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:38,390
Come on!

211
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,463
And you better find that Doctor's body or out you all go
- quarantine or no quarantine.

212
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:50,552
I don't understand what could have happened.
I must have dozed off or something

213
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:55,252
but one thing I am sure of
- something went out of that door just as you came in.

214
00:16:55,301 --> 00:16:59,180
That body can't just have vanished.
Polly, I am going to leave you alone...

215
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,356
...just for a minute.

216
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:01,789
All right.

217
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:05,102
Water. Water.

218
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,133
I'll go and get you some.

219
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:08,461
Water!

220
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:38,696
It's you.

221
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,588
The phantom piper!

222
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:43,679
No!

223
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:46,746
No! I'll not go with you!

224
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:49,921
Do you hear me, piper? No! Leave me!

225
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,942
Leave me. I'll not go with you, do you hear me?

226
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,923
Leave me! No, I'll not go with you!

227
00:17:57,096 --> 00:18:00,074
I'll fight you every inch of the way.

228
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:02,241
I'll not go with you.

229
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:11,461
Leave me, piper.

230
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:15,616
No. Leave me. I'll not go.

231
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,164
Agh!

232
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:25,880
- Polly, what's happened?
- Oh, Doctor, it was horrible!

233
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:30,387
- A giant creature like a Cyberman!
- It's all right. Don't be frightened.

234
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:34,737
- Whatever it was, it's gone now.
- It's the... Doctor, the Cyberman was carrying a patient.

235
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:38,362
- Cyberman? What are you talking about?
- I'm sure it was.

236
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:40,417
- I'll not go with you.
- It's OK. It's safe now. Take it easy.

237
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:43,638
She's right. There's another one gone.

238
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:48,947
Sam, Jules, you've got to find these men.
They can't just disappear in a place this size.

239
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:52,610
Search every square inch, don't come back
until you find them. Now move.

240
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:59,011
Now, supposing you tell me your story? What did you see?

241
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:02,312
I went out to get Jamie some water,

242
00:19:02,484 --> 00:19:08,600
and when I came back,
I saw this giant man or creature or something,

243
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:13,347
just going out of the door,
carrying one of the patients... like a doll.

244
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:17,170
- I think it was a Cyberman.
- Forget that part. Then what?

245
00:19:18,107 --> 00:19:21,760
Then nothing. The door shut, and then you came in.

246
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:27,723
- What do you know about all this?
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

247
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:30,055
We'll see about that in a minute.

248
00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:34,326
- This thing you saw. What was it like?
- It was enormous, and silver.

249
00:19:34,494 --> 00:19:37,987
- It had holes in its head for eyes, like a robot.
- A robot?

250
00:19:38,158 --> 00:19:41,410
But the Cybermen were all killed when Mondas blew up.

251
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:42,494
Stop this Cyberman nonsense!

252
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:46,894
There were Cybermen, every child knows that,
but they were destroyed ages ago!

253
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:49,747
- So we all thought.
- That's enough.

254
00:19:49,915 --> 00:19:52,205
Let's have a little calm thinking.

255
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:57,556
For the past two weeks,
a complete unknown disease has appeared in the base.

256
00:19:57,726 --> 00:20:01,986
People drop in their tracks
and develop a black pattern on their skin.

257
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:04,079
Then some of the patients disappear, right?

258
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:10,644
They can't leave the base without wearing spacesuits,
and there are no spacesuits missing. So where are they?

259
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:14,511
- I must say, It does sound a little odd.
- More than a little.

260
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:19,499
I do know one thing - a new disease starts,
people disappear, and then you turn up.

261
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,243
- And you think we did it!
- Oh, come on, we haven't done a thing!

262
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:27,274
Perhaps maybe, I don't know who you are,
what you are, or where you came from,

263
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:29,491
but you can get off the moon now!

264
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:32,953
- Well, that suits me fine, the sooner the better!
- No, Ben, we can't go yet.

265
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:38,066
- Why not? They don't want us here.
- Because there is something evil here. We must stay.

266
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:41,529
- Evil? Don't be daft!
- Evil is what I meant.

267
00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:46,882
There are some corners of the universe
which have bred the most terrible things.

268
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,111
Things which act against everything
that we believe in. They must be fought.

269
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:57,872
This disease, for instance. It isn't really
a disease at all, but I can help you with it.

270
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:01,373
You'll see. I'll find the cause for you.

271
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:05,404
- Will you, indeed?
- Yes, certainly. I just need to examine a few things. That's all.

272
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:08,983
- It should be simple.
- Well, I'm not sure.

273
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,864
I'll give you just one Earth-day cycle to find the cause.

274
00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:15,916
- Earth what?
- 24 hours.

275
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,492
- But that's no time at all.
- It's all you're going to get.

276
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:22,720
Then you get off the moon, with this bloke here.

277
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:25,896
- You can't move him! He's very ill.
- We accept.

278
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:29,684
Now tell me, you have pathological equipment here, yes?

279
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,672
Yes. Evans was working on an extensive research project.
It's all in here.

280
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:40,191
It's quite a small unit. We're not equipped
to deal with a full-scale epidemic.

281
00:21:41,449 --> 00:21:44,253
- Do you think you can manage?
- Yes. I think I can.

282
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:49,579
Right. I'll leave you to it. Don't forget - 24 hours.

283
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,322
- What are you going to do, Doctor?
- We'll start with this one.

284
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:05,779
- Are you really a medical doctor?
- Yes, I think I was once

285
00:22:05,848 --> 00:22:10,061
Polly, I think I took a degree once, in Glasgow.

286
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:15,923
1888, I think. Lister. Hold that for me, will you?

287
00:22:17,643 --> 00:22:21,021
- Oh!
- All right. He's quite unconscious.

288
00:22:50,822 --> 00:22:56,492
It's all right, Jamie. It's all right.
You're going to get better but you must lie still.

289
00:22:56,661 --> 00:23:00,233
What is this place? Is it the home of the piper?

290
00:23:00,405 --> 00:23:03,783
No, we're on the moon. You know, the moon up in the sky.

291
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:05,792
No, I can't be alive.

292
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:08,286
I've just seen the piper.

293
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,641
The piper! I knew!

294
00:24:02,957 --> 00:24:05,534
Polly! What's happened?

295
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,488
Polly.

296
00:24:07,651 --> 00:24:09,781
Are you all right?

297
00:24:12,644 --> 00:24:15,300
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

298
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:19,642
- Isn't there any clue at all?
- No. It's a complete blank.

299
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:25,159
All the tests are negative. As far as I can see,
this whole ridiculous place is sterile.

300
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:28,561
We'll have to tell Mr Hobson, I suppose.

301
00:24:28,693 --> 00:24:31,561
I don't like it very much. I simply don't understand it.

302
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:36,940
Doctor, it couldn't possibly have
anything to do with Lister, could it?

303
00:24:37,002 --> 00:24:39,407
- Lister?
- Well, I mean, you did say...

304
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,591
that you took your degree in Glasgow in 1888.

305
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,871
That's an awfully long time from now, 2070, whatever it is.

306
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:49,714
Polly, are you suggesting that
I'm not confident to carry out these tests?

307
00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:54,994
No, No, I'm just wondering if there was anything
that Joseph Lister didn't know in 1888

308
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:59,467
- that might help you now.
- Ssh! Somebody's coming!

309
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:04,855
It's Mr Hobson. Out for blood - ours. Look busy! Quick!

310
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,640
That's the third person to disappear in the past few hours.

311
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,547
- It's completely illogical.
- Do you mind?

312
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:17,138
Would you mind standing away from the door
and allowing it to close? The slides. The dust!

313
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:25,637
It must be you people.
We've got some straight talking to do, you and I.

314
00:25:25,802 --> 00:25:28,172
- Polly. Another boot.
- Do you hear me?

315
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:31,991
- This is extraordinary. Look here.
- Excuse me, please.

316
00:25:32,888 --> 00:25:36,186
Excuse me. We ARE trying to help you.

317
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:40,577
- Help? Is that what you call it? You can all get off the moon now.
- No, wait a minute. You said...

318
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,708
- I don't care what I said!
- Ah!

319
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:46,205
- Have you found something?
- I think perhaps I have.

320
00:25:47,584 --> 00:25:52,165
Yes, I may be onto something, but I must have some room.

321
00:25:52,336 --> 00:25:57,077
How can I work under these conditions? Now, please,
come along. Outside. I'm trying to work in here!

322
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,820
- Ben, see that they stay outside.
- Did you mean that?

323
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,156
- What?
- You've found something?

324
00:26:04,012 --> 00:26:06,864
Oh, Polly, I only wish I had.

325
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:34,488
- Coffee? Sugar?
- Hello, Doctor. Thank you.

326
00:26:36,547 --> 00:26:40,165
- It's very hot. Doctor, what about you?
- Thank you, Polly.

327
00:26:40,331 --> 00:26:45,358
Doctor, as I was saying, you've had your chance.
You come up with absolutely nothing.

328
00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:53,737
Don't touch him!

329
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,389
Let me look.

330
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:09,561
Charlie and you, Ben, give us a hand
to get him into the medical unit.

331
00:27:09,724 --> 00:27:12,208
Try not to touch his skin.

332
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:33,513
Don't drink that! It's the sugar!

333
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:37,350
Don't you see? That's why the disease doesn't affect everyone.

334
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:39,350
It's the sugar. Not everyone takes it.

335
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,523
Don't touch it.

336
00:27:54,578 --> 00:27:56,983
- What are you doing?
- Just be patient.

337
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:10,520
Just as I thought.

338
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:14,219
A large neurotropic virus.

339
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:16,965
- Like the space plague?
- No.

340
00:28:17,126 --> 00:28:20,904
It's a large infective agent that only attacks the nerves.

341
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:23,920
That's why these patients got these lines
appear on faces and hands.

342
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:26,920
It follows the course of the nerves under the skin.

343
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:28,557
That's _ it well. But how did it get in here?

344
00:28:28,722 --> 00:28:33,800
It is the Cybermen. I believe they have
deliberately infected the base.

345
00:28:33,855 --> 00:28:36,602
My men have searched every square of the base.

346
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:39,202
There's no space to hide a cat, let alone a Cyberman.

347
00:28:39,268 --> 00:28:41,318
Anyhow, how did they get in?

348
00:28:42,532 --> 00:28:44,777
- One moment.
- What is it?

349
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:51,180
- You say you searched all the base?
- Yes. What of it?

350
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:55,529
- No chance of anyone hiding anywhere?
- None whatever.

351
00:28:56,423 --> 00:28:59,755
Did your men search in here? Did they?

352
00:28:59,926 --> 00:29:03,883
- There was'nt people in here, so...
- Did they search in here?

353
00:29:03,947 --> 00:29:07,166
- No.
- There's nowhere in here they could hide.

354
00:29:38,297 --> 00:29:41,870
Oh, no! Back!

355
00:29:42,042 --> 00:29:43,644
Back.

356
00:29:52,231 --> 00:29:56,854
Stand back, stand back from that door.

357
00:29:58,742 --> 00:29:59,901
You're right! It is them!

358
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:10,554
Quick! Get out of it!

359
00:30:10,747 --> 00:30:11,368
No!

360
00:30:18,432 --> 00:30:19,984
Remain still.

361
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:24,662
You devils! You killed him! An unarmed man!

362
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:25,775
Get up.

363
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,823
You are known to us.

364
00:30:33,743 --> 00:30:34,640
And you to me.

365
00:30:36,905 --> 00:30:39,656
Who is in command?

366
00:30:40,147 --> 00:30:41,034
I am.

367
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:43,374
You will be needed.

368
00:30:43,797 --> 00:30:45,364
What have you done with my men?

369
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,007
They will return.

370
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:49,771
They're not dead?!

371
00:30:50,305 --> 00:30:54,689
No. They are not dead. They are altered.

372
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,394
Altered? What have you done to them?

373
00:30:56,475 --> 00:30:58,485
They are now controlled.

374
00:30:59,848 --> 00:31:01,402
If you do anything to my...

375
00:31:01,477 --> 00:31:03,114
You will do nothing.

376
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:07,976
You will now take us to the control centre.

377
00:31:08,237 --> 00:31:10,053
I'll be damned...

378
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:14,054
Through here.

379
00:31:17,452 --> 00:31:25,202
You will remain here. If you leave
you will be converted like the others.

380
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:43,658
Survey party, come in, we are not receiving you, over.

381
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:50,785
Can we see the control antenna from here?

382
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,334
No, Roger. It's just around that first block
just outside the main port.

383
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,647
So, we have to send somebody outside so get ready...

384
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:57,567
We have to...

385
00:31:57,773 --> 00:31:59,492
Get back! Get back! These things are lethal!

386
00:31:59,772 --> 00:32:02,324
None will move.

387
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:04,402
If you move you will be killed.

388
00:32:05,147 --> 00:32:06,732
What are they?! How did they get in!?

389
00:32:06,964 --> 00:32:11,067
Silence! We are Cybermen!

390
00:32:11,313 --> 00:32:13,171
But you were all killed!

391
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,506
We are going to take over the Gravitron

392
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:23,506
And use it to destroy the surface of the Earth
by changing the weather.

393
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,046
But that will kill everybody on the Earth.

394
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,243
Yes.

395
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:32,039
You're supposed to be so advanced. Here you are,
taking your revenge like children.

396
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:35,216
Revenge? What is that?

397
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:37,506
A feeling people have...

398
00:32:37,741 --> 00:32:44,168
Feelings? Yes, we know of this weakness of yours.

399
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:49,268
We are fortunate. We do not posses feelings.

400
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:51,157
Then why are you here?

401
00:32:51,486 --> 00:32:54,367
To eliminate all dangers.

402
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:57,948
But you kill every single thing on the Earth!

403
00:32:58,162 --> 00:33:02,282
Yes. All dangers will be eliminated.

404
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:05,953
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

405
00:33:07,274 --> 00:33:08,616
You seem to be better.

406
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:09,973
Aye, I feel myself again.

407
00:33:10,163 --> 00:33:11,061
Lie back there!

408
00:33:11,294 --> 00:33:12,098
But I'm better!

409
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:14,681
Oh, my head.

410
00:33:14,898 --> 00:33:16,183
Well, take it easy, mate.

411
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:19,156
At least, you know it is not your McCrimmon piper.

412
00:33:19,384 --> 00:33:21,573
It had me worried though, I admit that.

413
00:33:21,763 --> 00:33:23,748
Yeah, those Cybermen have got us all worried mate.

414
00:33:23,763 --> 00:33:25,248
We see them in action before.

415
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,869
They must have some weakness.

416
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:30,910
Well, in my day, they used to sprinkle witches with holy water.

417
00:33:31,174 --> 00:33:32,837
Fat lot of use that would be on them.

418
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,279
Sprinkle... Holy Water... Ben!

419
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:39,694
What are the Cybermen covered in?

420
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,804
As far as I know, their suit is a metal of some sort.

421
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:48,935
What about that thing on their chests? You know the part
that replaced their heart and lungs.

422
00:33:49,136 --> 00:33:50,286
Some kind of plastic I think.

423
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:56,800
I thought so. You see, it's simple.
Nail vanish remover dissolves nail vanish.

424
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:02,005
Nail vanish is a plastic. So we do what Jamie says,
we sprinkle them, see?!

425
00:34:02,144 --> 00:34:03,848
No, clear as mud if you ask me.

426
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:05,766
Anyway, I am going to try an experiment.

427
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:08,161
Yes, Professor.

428
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,284
Dr. Evans! I thought he was dead.
I thought that they were all dead!

429
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:28,903
Bet if they were by the look of it.

430
00:34:39,636 --> 00:34:45,247
Tell the operators in the power unit to come out.

431
00:34:45,578 --> 00:34:46,861
Now.

432
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:56,391
All right, you can all see what is happening.

433
00:34:56,435 --> 00:34:59,891
Come on out, leave the machine and don't try anything.

434
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:11,009
They will now take over the Gravitron power unit.

435
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,161
Yes.

436
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:34,016
But you can't send them in their without protected helmets.

437
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:35,203
Why?

438
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:38,170
The machine produces very intense sonic fields.

439
00:35:38,275 --> 00:35:41,170
Without the helmets, those men will be insane in a few hours!

440
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:43,225
How many hours?

441
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:44,681
Twelve possibly.

442
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:47,426
Then there is no problem.

443
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:48,276
Why?

444
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:52,074
Our purpose will be achieved before that.

445
00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:54,371
But what about the men?

446
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:58,338
They will be disposed of.

447
00:36:06,136 --> 00:36:08,218
Now, keep your fingers crossed.

448
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:12,258
It works!

449
00:36:12,522 --> 00:36:14,007
But I still don't know what you are on about.

450
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:18,103
If we can sprinkle some of that on their chest units,
it might help to soften them.

451
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,095
I get it! You mean it will clobber their controls or something.

452
00:36:21,298 --> 00:36:22,173
Yes, that's it.

453
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:33,076
May the power into the vortex generators now.

454
00:36:37,173 --> 00:36:39,257
What is happening?

455
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:41,902
There is loss of control.

456
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:03,199
Now look, we only have one chance at this.

457
00:37:03,201 --> 00:37:05,799
When I open the door, drop down as low as you can,

458
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:08,799
aim this things... at their chests and squirt like mad. Right?

459
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:09,603
Right.

460
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:10,456
Get ready.

461
00:37:10,486 --> 00:37:12,688
Someone is there.

462
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,613
Quick, get their chest things!

463
00:37:41,603 --> 00:37:43,298
Quick, get these things off their heads!

464
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:53,339
Come on! Quick, there isn't a moment to lose./

465
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:56,039
We got to get the Gravitron down to safe level.

466
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,287
What about those poor men?

467
00:37:57,496 --> 00:37:59,466
Shift them off to the medical unit, as quick as you can.

468
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:09,524
We are not receiving you. We are not receiving you.

469
00:38:10,517 --> 00:38:13,590
They must have failed.

470
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:20,817
Yes. We must invade now. Prepare the weapons.

471
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:22,352
Yes.

472
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:28,964
Now listen everybody. I don't know how many more
of these Cybermen there are, /

473
00:38:28,991 --> 00:38:33,164
but our point of view we are under siege.
I'll reckon they will be back in a bit...

474
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:36,802
Now communications. Charlie, keep trying
to get through to Earth. Right?

475
00:38:36,974 --> 00:38:37,608
Right, will do.

476
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:40,322
The rest of you, lower the armoured doors at all exits./

477
00:38:40,407 --> 00:38:43,822
Make up as much of that gubbins that you got, we may need it.

478
00:38:44,004 --> 00:38:47,389
Mr Hobson, how far can the probe be lowered down?

479
00:38:47,717 --> 00:38:48,717
About thirty degrees.

480
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:49,524
That's no good.

481
00:38:49,677 --> 00:38:50,553
What do you mean?

482
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,435
Can any other part be lowered?

483
00:38:52,777 --> 00:38:56,271
Well, the main coil lenses can be shifted about
without too much trouble but...

484
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:57,400
There's something outside there!

485
00:38:57,579 --> 00:38:58,227
What is it?

486
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,212
It's a long way off.

487
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:00,340
I'll come.

488
00:40:39,716 --> 00:40:43,146
They can't just march in here, can they?

489
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,646
Not now. We've discovered how they got in.

490
00:40:44,717 --> 00:40:46,807
Yes. They tunnelled into the storeroom.

491
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,317
- Doctor, Mr. Hobson, come quickly!
- What is it?

492
00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:58,287
<i>Moonbase, Moonbase</i>

493
00:40:58,454 --> 00:41:02,609
<i>- They've got our wavelength. We hear you.
- You are surrounded.</i>

494
00:41:02,772 --> 00:41:05,550
<i>All resistance is useless.</i>

495
00:41:05,718 --> 00:41:08,863
<i>You must open the entry port.</i>

496
00:41:09,028 --> 00:41:14,835
Let me. You're wasting your time.
We've discovered your passageway and blocked it.

497
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,189
<i>- You cannot enter now.
- Resistance is useless.</i>

498
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:22,377
- Can they get in?
- I don't know, but I'm not stopping to find out.

499
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:25,083
- Get me Earth as quick as you can.
- Right.

500
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,269
Weather Control Moon calling Earth. Come in.

501
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:38,033
<i>Emergency! Emergency!</i>

502
00:41:38,202 --> 00:41:41,623
<i>There is a spaceship approaching from Earth.</i>

503
00:41:41,794 --> 00:41:47,522
<i>It will arrive on the lunar surface in 15 minutes.</i>

504
00:41:47,686 --> 00:41:52,003
<i>Immediate offensive action must be taken.</i>

505
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:55,941
<i>They have blocked up our way into the base.</i>

506
00:41:56,114 --> 00:42:00,465
<i>Other methods to gain entry will be tried.</i>

507
00:42:01,326 --> 00:42:05,068
<i>The machine from Earth must first be destroyed.</i>

508
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:08,466
<i>There are 14 minutes left.</i>

509
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:10,399
<i>Understood.</i>

510
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:23,720
<i>Transmit control signal.</i>

511
00:43:34,954 --> 00:43:41,112
<i>You will listen to me and follow my instructions.</i>

512
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:43,901
Here we are. I've brought some coffee to keep us awake.

513
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:47,008
- Without sugar this time, I hope?
- Of course. Don't remind me.

514
00:43:47,177 --> 00:43:50,241
- Take some to the Doctor. He's in the Dome.
- Right.

515
00:44:17,082 --> 00:44:23,854
<i>You will now change field co-ordinates as instructed.</i>

516
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:31,003
Doctor, they've spotted it on the scanner - the relief ship.

517
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,094
- Ben, where?   - Over here.   - Let's see.

518
00:44:33,264 --> 00:44:36,570
- Well?
- No doubt about it. I told you they would be on their way!

519
00:44:36,762 --> 00:44:38,208
It's not far off.

520
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:41,636
Far off? It's coming in now off parking orbit.
It will be down in six minutes.

521
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:45,308
- Don't think you ought to warn them?
- Yes, the Cybermen will be waiting for them.

522
00:44:45,479 --> 00:44:49,358
Don't worry. They've got their own warning system and weapons.

523
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:54,235
They'll blast the Cybermen and their spaceship
to kingdom come in about four minutes from now.

524
00:44:56,255 --> 00:44:58,263
Come on!

525
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:01,097
It seems to move so slowly.

526
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:10,258
- What are they doing?
- Looks like they've changed direction.

527
00:45:11,147 --> 00:45:14,372
They've changed into an escape orbit. Follow it.

528
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:17,762
- It's going too fast. I can't keep up with it.
- Keep trying.

529
00:45:17,927 --> 00:45:23,552
- I can't hold it. It's accelerating too fast.
- Look out man. You're on the sun.

530
00:45:23,614 --> 00:45:27,041
- That's where it's heading.
- The acceleration is.. it's gigantic!

531
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:32,568
- Get R/T contact with the ship.
- It's no good, sir...the doppler effect...It's going too fast.

532
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:36,842
They've had it, I'm afraid.

533
00:45:37,015 --> 00:45:39,391
- The sun...
- Yes.

534
00:45:39,557 --> 00:45:42,576
Will somebody please tell us what it all means?

535
00:45:42,746 --> 00:45:47,222
The rocket has been deflected towards the sun.
Nothing can save them now.

536
00:45:47,387 --> 00:45:51,048
- Save them? What are you talking about?
- From plunging into the sun.

537
00:45:51,221 --> 00:45:53,516
But the sun's millions of miles away.

538
00:45:53,683 --> 00:45:58,113
Once they get into the sun's gravity belt,
they can't change course.

539
00:45:58,283 --> 00:46:01,509
It may take a week but they'll end up there.

540
00:46:01,673 --> 00:46:04,899
What on earth could have caused it?

541
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:08,530
The rocket was deflected off course, but why, and how?

542
00:46:08,696 --> 00:46:10,704
Deflected?

543
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:15,905
- Yes, of course. The Gravitron!
- Have the Cybermen got a gravity weapon, do you think?

544
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:17,851
- No, they haven't, but we have.
- You're not suggesting...?

545
00:46:18,017 --> 00:46:23,547
The only one way that rocket could be deflected
into the sun... was this very room.

546
00:46:23,618 --> 00:46:24,324
I see what you mean.

547
00:46:24,394 --> 00:46:26,529
Of course - the Gravitron.

548
00:46:26,694 --> 00:46:31,114
- Benson! He must...
- I said he'd been on duty too long.

549
00:46:31,286 --> 00:46:32,696
If it IS Benson...

550
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,819
It's Evans!

551
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:51,356
- He was in the medical room.
- The Cybermen have control of them again.

552
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,737
- And the other men in there?
- They may not be affected yet.

553
00:46:54,904 --> 00:46:57,996
Get down to the medical room.
Barricade the door with everything you can find.

554
00:46:58,004 --> 00:46:59,496
- Keep them in there at all costs!  - Right.

555
00:47:21,392 --> 00:47:23,848
What is he doing in there?

556
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:29,705
Look at the field reactors. We must get back control soon.

557
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:33,576
He could flood half of Europe
if he keeps the Gravitron aligned with spring tides.

558
00:47:33,741 --> 00:47:36,679
That settles it. We'll have to rush him.
Get those weapons out.

559
00:47:42,338 --> 00:47:45,356
<i>Resistance is useless.</i>

560
00:47:45,526 --> 00:47:49,872
<i>All further ships from Earth will be deflected.</i>

561
00:47:49,938 --> 00:47:52,048
<i>Open the air lock to us.</i>

562
00:47:52,221 --> 00:47:55,687
<i>If you do not, we shall destroy the base,</i>

563
00:47:55,853 --> 00:47:58,343
<i>and you will be eliminated.</i>

564
00:47:58,516 --> 00:48:00,043
Can you hear me?

565
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:05,284
<i>Everything you have said
in the past half-hour has been overheard.</i>

566
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:10,624
You can hear this, too, then: we're not done yet,
and we'll fight you to the last man.

567
00:48:10,785 --> 00:48:14,894
<i>- You'll never get inside this base!
- We are in it already.</i>

568
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:20,308
They've punctured the dome!

569
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:24,098
The oxygen masks.
Everyone take a mask over there!

570
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:35,839
I hope that we don't lose too much oxygen.

571
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:39,073
- Can we patch it, do you think?
- We can try.

572
00:48:39,237 --> 00:48:41,246
Give me a hand off with this.

573
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:45,044
Doctor, I can't breathe.

574
00:48:49,447 --> 00:48:52,190
Thank heavens! I can breathe again.

575
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,428
Oh, no!

576
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,744
- What can we patch it with?
- Nothing.

577
00:49:00,908 --> 00:49:02,642
Wait...

578
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:04,458
Over there.

579
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,053
Slide it to me but don't let go of it.

580
00:49:11,401 --> 00:49:14,910
We have to do it in one action. No second chance. Are you ready?

581
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,403
Now!

582
00:49:23,751 --> 00:49:26,000
Stopped them for the moment.

583
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:29,994
- I wonder for how long.
- Let's have a look.

584
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:41,424
Polly! Are you all right?

585
00:49:42,436 --> 00:49:44,089
Yes.

586
00:49:45,786 --> 00:49:49,331
- Where's that air coming from?
- Reserve tanks of oxygen.

587
00:49:49,498 --> 00:49:53,733
- Why couldn't we have had those before?
- And lose all our oxygen?

588
00:49:53,897 --> 00:49:55,905
I see.

589
00:50:01,403 --> 00:50:04,708
- It's so quiet!  - Yes, it is, isn't it?

590
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:07,410
The Gravitron's stopped!

591
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:12,693
Quick. Before he comes to. Ben! Jamie!

592
00:50:13,874 --> 00:50:15,446
Joe!

593
00:50:15,609 --> 00:50:19,636
We've barricaded the sick bay with half the chairs and tables in the base, but it won’t hold them for ever.

594
00:50:19,703 --> 00:50:22,628
- Well done. - Here's another one for you.

595
00:50:22,793 --> 00:50:25,731
- What do we do with him, Doctor?
- That's your problem.

596
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,794
Just make sure he doesn’t come back here for a while.

597
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:31,425
I’ll be after a job as a copper when I get
back to 1966!

598
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:36,828
Mr Hobson, I've got an idea.

599
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:41,184
- Doctor, what do you make of this?
- Made by a laser beam, I think.

600
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:46,429
- Is there anything known to science the Cybermen haven't got?
- They haven’t got a Gravitron. Or they wouldn't be after yours.

601
00:50:46,497 --> 00:50:49,516
We'll have to stand guard here

602
00:50:49,685 --> 00:50:54,564
Not much use. They're getting
reinforcements. Looks like another spaceship.

603
00:50:55,376 --> 00:50:57,304
Just there.

604
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:58,792
Another one!

605
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,250
<i>We have brought
reinforcements with other weapons.</i>

606
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,897
<i>You have one chance.
You must open the entry port.</i>

607
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:19,984
<i>You cannot stop us now.
You will all be completely destroyed.</i>

608
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:25,321
- What does he mean, other weapons?
- We'll soon find out. You stay here. I must report this to Mr. Hobson.

609
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,504
<i>I shall count to ten.</i>

610
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:39,403
<i>If you still stupidly remain silent, we shall fire.</i>

611
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:41,737
<i>One...</i>

612
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:47,839
- Hurry! They've got another weapon. They're going to ...
- Yes, I know. There it is.

613
00:51:48,001 --> 00:51:51,869
Everybody take cover. Get down, all of you! Doctor!

614
00:51:52,037 --> 00:51:54,099
- Is the Gravitron still switched on?  - Yes.

615
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:55,854
Then I shall certainly stay here.

616
00:51:56,864 --> 00:52:01,456
<i>.. nine, ten... Fire!</i>

617
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,079
<i>Again. Fire.</i>

618
00:52:22,612 --> 00:52:26,354
- What happened?
- It just deflected over the dome.

619
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:28,260
- Are you all right?  - Yes.

620
00:52:28,424 --> 00:52:33,624
- The Gravitron deflected it. The force field.
- Yes. And that gives me an idea.

621
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:36,454
What are they doing now?

622
00:52:41,337 --> 00:52:43,231
They're packing it away.

623
00:52:43,395 --> 00:52:46,414
What will they cook up next?

624
00:52:49,893 --> 00:52:55,862
How far down can this be aimed? Can it be
brought to bear on the surface of the moon?

625
00:52:56,027 --> 00:52:58,483
- I see!  - Well...

626
00:52:58,651 --> 00:53:01,509
- Has it ever been tried?  - No, but we shall try.

627
00:53:01,677 --> 00:53:05,625
- With Evans gone, the Gravitron is all yours.
- Je m'en occupe!

628
00:53:05,794 --> 00:53:09,054
Any further down, and the field may affect the base.

629
00:53:09,224 --> 00:53:11,887
- What does that matter now?
- Ah, I suppose you're right.

630
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:16,560
- Get someone to stand by that window
and relay instructions direct to Benoit.
- Right!

631
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:30,121
- He's ready.  - Start moving the probe down.

632
00:54:24,813 --> 00:54:27,912
- That's as far as it will go.
- What?

633
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:30,217
But it's way over their heads.

634
00:54:30,382 --> 00:54:33,963
There's one chance. We'll try bringing it down by hand.

635
00:54:34,136 --> 00:54:37,154
- Is this still switched off?
- No, No.. Yes, of course.

636
00:54:43,054 --> 00:54:46,440
- It won't go.
- All your weight. Once more.

637
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:52,567
- It's no use. It won't shift.
- Ah, stupid of me! Of course it won't!

638
00:54:52,636 --> 00:54:54,872
- Why?
- The angular cut-out. It's obvious!

639
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,168
There's got to be a safety cut-out
on the angle of the probe.

640
00:55:01,336 --> 00:55:03,258
Otherwise, it might affect the whole base.

641
00:55:03,336 --> 00:55:07,258
That's done it. Stand back. Benoit can do it now.

642
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,082
Switch on!

643
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:48,506
Well, that's taken care of the Cybermen!

644
00:55:48,674 --> 00:55:54,034
We've got to get this Gravitron in operation as fast as we can!

645
00:55:54,203 --> 00:55:57,026
- I'm so sorry we damaged it.  - What? Oh, yes...

646
00:55:58,279 --> 00:56:02,193
Nils, rig up a temporary aerial. Call up Space Control.

647
00:56:02,355 --> 00:56:07,761
Tell Rinberg we'll be operational in about two hours.
It's the best we can do.

648
00:56:07,924 --> 00:56:13,125
Two hours! That's all we've got to
get the world's weather under control again.

649
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:17,160
Benoit, take charge of your side.
And, Doctor... What the...

650
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:22,767
It's just as well. We've enough madmen here already!

651
00:56:22,937 --> 00:56:26,518
I want to see your first weather plot in two minutes!

652
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:28,022
Come on, boys.

653
00:56:50,057 --> 00:56:51,388
Doctor, look.

654
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:56,099
- Could that be them?  - Possibly.

655
00:56:56,272 --> 00:56:59,210
And I hope it's the last we see of them.

656
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:22,988
There we are. In perfect flight.

657
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:28,440
- Yes, and look what happened last time!
- Just a bumpy landing. It won't happen again.

658
00:57:28,608 --> 00:57:29,973
- I know.
- What you're up now?

659
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:33,160
- Let's have a look at the Time Scanner. - The what?

660
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:38,496
The Time Scanner. Instead of showing where we are,
it gives you a glimpse of the future.

661
00:57:38,657 --> 00:57:41,802
The second sight? Very dangerous.

662
00:57:41,966 --> 00:57:46,719
Nonsense! I haven't used it very much.
It's not very reliable, as you can see.

663
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,302
Doctor...
