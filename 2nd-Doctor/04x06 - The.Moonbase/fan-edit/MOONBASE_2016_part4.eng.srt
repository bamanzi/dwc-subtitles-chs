1
00:40:39,716 --> 00:40:44,146
- They can't just march in here, can they?
- Not now we've discovered how they got in.

2
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,807
Yes. They tunnelled into the storeroom.

3
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,917
- Doctor, Mr. Hobson, come quickly!
- What is it?

4
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:57,887
<i>MoonbaseI MoonbaseI</i>

5
00:40:58,054 --> 00:41:02,209
<i>- They've got our wavelength. We hear you.
- You are surrounded.</i>

6
00:41:02,372 --> 00:41:05,150
<i>All resistance is useless.</i>

7
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:08,463
<i>You must open the entry port.</i>

8
00:41:08,628 --> 00:41:14,435
Let me. You're wasting your time. We've
discovered your passageway and blocked it.

9
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,789
<i>- You cannot enter now.
- Resistance is useless.</i>

10
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,977
- Can they get in?
- I don't know, but I'm not stopping to find out.

11
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,683
- Get me Earth as quick as you can.
- Right.

12
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,869
Weather Control Moon calling Earth.
Come in.

13
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:37,633
<i>Emergency! Emergency!</i>

14
00:41:37,802 --> 00:41:41,223
<i>There is a spaceship
approaching from Earth.</i>

15
00:41:41,394 --> 00:41:47,122
<i>It will arrive on the lunar surface
in 15 minutes.</i>

16
00:41:47,286 --> 00:41:51,603
<i>Immediate offensive action must be taken.</i>

17
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:55,541
<i>They have blocked up our way into the base.</i>

18
00:41:55,714 --> 00:42:00,065
<i>Other methods to gain entry will be tried.</i>

19
00:42:01,326 --> 00:42:05,068
<i>The machine from Earth
must first be destroyed.</i>

20
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:08,466
<i>There are 14 minutes left.</i>

21
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:10,399
<i>Understood.</i>

22
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:23,720
<i>Transmit control signal.</i>

23
00:43:34,954 --> 00:43:41,112
<i>You will listen to me
and follow my instructions.</i>

24
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:43,901
Here we are. I've brought some coffee to keep us awake.

25
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:47,008
- Without sugar this time, I hope?
- Of course. Don't remind me.

26
00:43:47,177 --> 00:43:50,241
- Take some to the Doctor. He's in the Dome.
- Right.

27
00:44:17,082 --> 00:44:23,854
<i>You will now change
field co-ordinates as instructed.</i>

28
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:31,003
Doctor, they've spotted it
on the scanner - the relief ship.

29
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,094
- Ben, where?
- Over here.
- Let's see.

30
00:44:33,264 --> 00:44:36,570
- Well?
- No doubt about it. I told you they would be on their way!

31
00:44:36,762 --> 00:44:38,208
It's not far off.

32
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:41,636
Far off? It's coming in now off parking orbit. It will be down in six minutes.

33
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:45,308
- Don't think you ought to warn them?
- Yes, the Cybermen will be waiting for them.

34
00:44:45,479 --> 00:44:48,658
Don't worry. They've got their own warning system and weapons.

35
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:54,235
They'll blast the Cybermen and their spaceship
to kingdom come four minutes from now.

36
00:44:56,255 --> 00:44:58,263
Come on!

37
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:01,097
It seems to move so slowly.

38
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:10,258
- What are they doing?
- Looks like they've changed direction.

39
00:45:11,147 --> 00:45:14,372
They've changed into an escape orbit.
Follow it.

40
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:17,762
- It's going too fast. I can't keep up with it.
- Keep trying.

41
00:45:17,927 --> 00:45:23,252
- I can't hold it. It's accelerating too fast.
- Look out man. You're on the sun.

42
00:45:23,414 --> 00:45:27,041
- That's where it's heading.
- The acceleration's gigantic!

43
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:32,568
- Get R/T contact with the ship.
- It's no good, sir...the
doppler effect...It's going too fast.

44
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:36,842
They've had it, I'm afraid.

45
00:45:37,015 --> 00:45:39,391
- The sun...
- Yes.

46
00:45:39,557 --> 00:45:42,576
Will somebody please tell us
what it all means?

47
00:45:42,746 --> 00:45:47,222
The rocket has been deflected
towards the sun. Nothing can save them now.

48
00:45:47,387 --> 00:45:51,048
- Save them? What do you mean?
- From plunging into the sun.

49
00:45:51,221 --> 00:45:53,516
But the sun's millions of miles away.

50
00:45:53,683 --> 00:45:58,113
Once they get into the sun's gravity belt,
they can't change course.

51
00:45:58,283 --> 00:46:01,509
It may take a week but they'll end up there.

52
00:46:01,673 --> 00:46:04,899
What on earth could have caused it?

53
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:08,530
The rocket was deflected off course,
but why, and how?

54
00:46:08,696 --> 00:46:10,704
Deflected?

55
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:15,905
- Yes, of course. The Gravitron!
- Have the Cybermen got a gravity weapon, do you think?

56
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:17,851
- No, they haven't, but we have.
- You're not suggesting...?

57
00:46:18,017 --> 00:46:22,447
The only one way that rocket could be deflected into the sun
was from this very room.

58
00:46:22,618 --> 00:46:24,224
I see what you mean.

59
00:46:24,394 --> 00:46:26,529
Of course - the Gravitron.

60
00:46:26,694 --> 00:46:30,614
- Benson! He must...
- I said he'd been on duty too long.

61
00:46:30,986 --> 00:46:32,696
If it IS Benson...

62
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,819
It's Evans!

63
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:51,356
- He was in the medical room.
- The Cybermen have control of them again.

64
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,737
- And the other men in there?
- They may not be affected yet.

65
00:46:54,904 --> 00:46:59,496
- Get down to the medical room. Barricade the door with everything
you can find. Keep them in there at all costs!
- Right.

66
00:47:21,392 --> 00:47:23,848
What is he doing in there?

67
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:30,105
Look at the field reactors. We must get back control soon. 
He could flood half of Europe

68
00:47:30,271 --> 00:47:33,576
if he keeps the Gravitron
aligned with spring tides.

69
00:47:33,741 --> 00:47:36,679
That settles it. We'll have to rush him.
Get those weapons out.

70
00:47:42,338 --> 00:47:45,356
<i>Resistance is useless.</i>

71
00:47:45,526 --> 00:47:49,072
<i>All further ships from Earth will be deflected.</i>

72
00:47:49,638 --> 00:47:52,048
<i>Open the air lock to us.</i>

73
00:47:52,221 --> 00:47:55,687
<i>If you do not, we shall destroy the base,</i>

74
00:47:55,853 --> 00:47:58,343
<i>and you will be eliminated.</i>

75
00:47:58,516 --> 00:48:00,043
Can you hear me?

76
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:05,284
<i>Everything you have said
in the past half-hour has been overheard.</i>

77
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:10,624
You can hear this, too, then. We're not done
yet, and we'll fight you to the last man.

78
00:48:10,785 --> 00:48:14,894
<i>- You'll never get inside this base!
- We are in it already.</i>

79
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:20,308
They've punctured the dome!

80
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:24,098
The oxygen masks.
Everyone take a mask over there!

81
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:35,839
I hope that we don't lose too much oxygen.

82
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:39,073
- Can we patch it, do you think?
- We can try.

83
00:48:39,237 --> 00:48:41,246
Give me a hand off with this.

84
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:45,044
Doctor, I can't breathe.

85
00:48:49,447 --> 00:48:52,190
Thank heavens! I can breathe again.

86
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,428
Oh, no!

87
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,744
- What can we patch it with?
- Nothing.

88
00:49:00,908 --> 00:49:02,642
Wait...

89
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:04,458
Over there.

90
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,053
Slide it to me but don't let go of it.

91
00:49:11,401 --> 00:49:14,510
We have to do it in one action. No second chance. Are you ready?

92
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,403
Now!

93
00:49:23,751 --> 00:49:26,000
Stopped them for the moment.

94
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:29,994
- I wonder for how long.
- Let's have a look.

95
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:41,424
Polly! Are you all right?

96
00:49:42,436 --> 00:49:44,089
Yes.

97
00:49:45,786 --> 00:49:49,331
- Where's that air coming from?
- Reserve tanks of oxygen.

98
00:49:49,498 --> 00:49:53,733
- Why couldn't we have had those before?
- And lose all our oxygen?

99
00:49:53,897 --> 00:49:55,905
I see.

100
00:50:01,403 --> 00:50:04,708
- It's so quiet!
- Yes, it is, isn't it?

101
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:07,410
The Gravitron's stopped!

102
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:12,693
Quick. Before he comes to. Ben! Jamie!

103
00:50:13,874 --> 00:50:15,446
Joe!

104
00:50:15,609 --> 00:50:19,636
We've barricaded the sick bay with half the chairs and tables in the base, but it won’t
hold them for ever.

105
00:50:19,703 --> 00:50:22,628
Well done.
Here's another one for you.

106
00:50:22,793 --> 00:50:25,731
- What do we do with him, Doctor?
- That's your problem.

107
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,794
Just make sure he doesn’t come
back here for a while.

108
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:31,425
I’ll be after a job as a copper when I get
back to 1966!

109
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:36,828
Mr Hobson, I've got an idea.

110
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:41,184
- Doctor, what do you make of this?
- Made by a laser beam, I think.

111
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:46,429
- Is there anything the Cybermen haven't got?
- They haven’t got a Gravitron. Or they wouldn't be after yours.

112
00:50:46,497 --> 00:50:49,516
We'll have to stand guard here
with their cyberguns.

113
00:50:49,685 --> 00:50:54,564
Not much use. They're getting
reinforcements. Looks like another spaceship.

114
00:50:55,376 --> 00:50:57,304
Just there.

115
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:58,792
Another one!

116
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,250
<i>We have brought
reinforcements with other weapons.</i>

117
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,897
<i>You have one chance.
You must open the entry port.</i>

118
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:19,984
<i>You cannot stop us now.
You will all be completely destroyed.</i>

119
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:25,321
- What does he mean, other weapons?
- We'll soon find out. You stay here. I must report this to Mr. Hobson.

120
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,504
<i>I shall count to ten.</i>

121
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:39,403
<i>If you still stupidly remain silent,
we shall fire.</i>

122
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:41,737
<i>One...</i>

123
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:47,839
- Hurry! They've got another weapon. They're going to ...
- Yes, I know. There it is.

124
00:51:48,001 --> 00:51:51,869
Everybody take cover.
Get down, all of you! Doctor!

125
00:51:52,037 --> 00:51:54,099
- Is the Gravitron still switched on?
- Yes.

126
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:55,854
Then I shall certainly stay here.

127
00:51:56,864 --> 00:52:01,456
<i>.. nine, ten... FireI</i>

128
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,079
<i>Again. Fire.</i>

129
00:52:22,612 --> 00:52:26,354
- What happened?
- It just deflected over the dome.

130
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:28,260
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

131
00:52:28,424 --> 00:52:33,624
- The Gravitron deflected it. The force field.
- Yes. And that gives me an idea.

132
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:36,454
What are they doing now?

133
00:52:41,337 --> 00:52:43,231
They're packing it away.

134
00:52:43,395 --> 00:52:46,414
What will they cook up next?

135
00:52:49,893 --> 00:52:55,862
How far down can this be aimed? Can it be
brought to bear on the surface of the moon?

136
00:52:56,027 --> 00:52:58,483
- I see!
- Well...

137
00:52:58,651 --> 00:53:01,509
- Has it ever been tried?
- No, but we shall try.

138
00:53:01,677 --> 00:53:05,625
- With Evans gone, the Gravitron is all yours.
- Je m'en occupe!

139
00:53:05,794 --> 00:53:09,054
Any further down,
and the field may affect the base.

140
00:53:09,224 --> 00:53:11,887
- What does that matter now?
- Ah, I suppose you're right.

141
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:16,560
- Get someone to stand by that window
and relay instructions direct to Benoit.
- Right!

142
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:30,121
- He's ready.
- Start moving the probe down.

143
00:54:24,813 --> 00:54:27,912
- That's as far as it will go.
- What?

144
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:30,217
But it's way over their heads.

145
00:54:30,382 --> 00:54:33,963
There's one chance.
We'll try bringing it down by hand.

146
00:54:34,136 --> 00:54:37,154
- Is this still switched off?
- No, No.. Yes, of course.

147
00:54:43,054 --> 00:54:46,440
- It won't go.
- All your weight. Once more.

148
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:52,567
- It's no use. It won't shift.
- Ah, stupid of me! Of course it won't!

149
00:54:52,636 --> 00:54:54,872
- Why?
- The angular cut-out. It's obvious!

150
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,168
There's got to be a safety cut-out
on the angle of the probe.

151
00:55:01,336 --> 00:55:07,258
Otherwise, it might affect the whole base.
That's done it. Stand back. Benoit can do it now.

152
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,082
Switch on!

153
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:48,506
Well, that's taken care of the Cybermen!

154
00:55:48,674 --> 00:55:54,034
We've got to get this Gravitron
in operation as fast as we can!

155
00:55:54,203 --> 00:55:57,026
- I'm so sorry we damaged it.
- What? Oh, yes...

156
00:55:58,279 --> 00:56:02,193
Nils, rig up a temporary aerial.
Call up Space Control.

157
00:56:02,355 --> 00:56:07,761
Tell Rinberg we'll be operational
in about two hours. It's the best we can do.

158
00:56:07,924 --> 00:56:13,125
We've only two hours to get
the world's weather under control again.

159
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:17,160
Benoit, take charge of your side.
And, Doctor... What the...

160
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:22,767
It's just as well.
We've enough madmen here already!

161
00:56:22,937 --> 00:56:26,518
I want to see
your first weather plot in two minutes!

162
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:28,022
Come on, boys.

163
00:56:50,057 --> 00:56:51,388
Doctor, look.

164
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:56,099
Could that be them?
Possibly.

165
00:56:56,272 --> 00:56:59,210
And I hope it's the last we see of them.

169
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:33,160
- Let's have a look at the Time Scanner.
- The what?

170
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:38,496
The Time Scanner. Instead of showing where
we are, it gives you a glimpse of the future.

171
00:57:38,657 --> 00:57:41,802
The second sight? Very dangerous.

172
00:57:41,966 --> 00:57:46,719
Nonsense! I haven't used it very much.
It's not very reliable, as you can see.

173
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,302
Doctor...

174
00:57:48,464 --> 00:57:50,277
Look!

175
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,500
Next: The Macra Terror
