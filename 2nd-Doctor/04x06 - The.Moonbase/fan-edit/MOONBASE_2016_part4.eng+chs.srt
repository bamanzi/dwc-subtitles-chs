Deflected?
导偏？

- 是了, 当然, 引力创！  - 赛博人有引力武器吗, 你觉得？

56
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:17,851
- No, they haven't, but we have.
- You're not suggesting...?
- 不, 他们没有, 但我们有  - 你不是想说...？

The only one way that rocket could be deflected
into the sun... was this very room.

64
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,737

- They may not be affected yet.
- 那里的其他人呢？  - 他们可能还未受影响

65
00:46:54,904 --> 00:46:57,996
Get down to the medical room.
Barricade the door with everything you can find.
赶紧去医务室, 用所有能找到的东西把门堵上

What is he doing in there?
他在那里面做什么？

68
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:29,705
Look at the field reactors. We must get back control soon. 
看看域反应器(?), 我们必须赶紧夺回控制权

69
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:33,576
He could flood half of Europe
if he keeps the Gravitron aligned with spring tides.
他可能都淹了半个欧洲了，如果他一直让引力创定在涨潮位置的话

70
00:47:33,741 --> 00:47:36,679
That settles it. We'll have to rush him.
Get those weapons out.

and we'll fight you to the last man.
你还能听到这个：咱们没完，我们会跟你们战斗到最后一个人

00:48:10,785 --> 00:48:14,894
<i>- You'll never get inside this base!
- We are in it already.</i>
- 你们永远进不了这个基地  - 我们已经进来了

80
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:20,308
They've punctured the dome!
他们打穿了穹顶！

81
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:24,098
The oxygen masks.
Everyone take a mask over there!
氧气面罩！所有人都那儿去带上氧气面罩！

82
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:35,839
I hope that we don't lose too much oxygen.
我期望我们没丧失多少氧气

83
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:39,073

Slide it to me but don't let go of it.

Stopped them for the moment.

- Reserve tanks of oxygen.
- 那些空气哪里来的？ - 预备的氧气瓶

99
00:49:49,498 --> 00:49:53,733
- Why couldn't we have had those before?
- And lose all our oxygen?
- 之前为什么没有？ - 你是说失去我们所有的氧气？

100
00:49:53,897 --> 00:49:55,905

104
00:50:13,874 --> 00:50:15,446
Joe!

105
00:50:15,609 --> 00:50:19,636
We've barricaded the sick bay with half the chairs and tables in the base, but it won’t hold them for ever.
我们堵住了医务室，用了基地半数的椅子和桌子，但没法永远挡住他们

106
00:50:19,703 --> 00:50:22,628

Just make sure he doesn’t come back here for a while.
只是要确保短时间内他不能回到这里来

back to 1966!
等我回到1966年，我要去找个当警察的职业干干

- 博士，你觉得这是怎么造成的  - 激光束，我想是

112
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:46,429
- Is there anything known to science the Cybermen haven't got?
- They haven’t got a Gravitron. Or they wouldn't be after yours.
科学上已知的东西里面有没有什么赛博人没掌握的？
他们还没有引力创，否则他们不会来抢你们的

113
00:50:46,497 --> 00:50:49,516
We'll have to stand guard here
with their cyberguns.

114
00:50:49,685 --> 00:50:54,564
Not much use. They're getting
reinforcements. Looks like another spaceship.

现在你们阻挡不了我们了. 你们全部都会被完全消灭

120
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:25,321

- We'll soon find out. You stay here. I must report this to Mr. Hobson.
他什么意思，“其它武器”？

127
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:55,854
Then I shall certainly stay here.
那我就一定还得留在这里

128
00:51:56,864 --> 00:52:01,456
<i>.. nine, ten... Fire!</i>
...九，十...开火！

129
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,079
<i>Again. Fire.</i>
再来，开火！

130
00:52:22,612 --> 00:52:26,354
- What happened?
- It just deflected over the dome.
- 什么情况？ - 它刚才转弯从穹顶上飞过去了

131
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:28,260
- Are you all right?  - Yes.
- 你没事吧？  - 没事

132
00:52:28,424 --> 00:52:33,624
- The Gravitron deflected it. The force field.
- Yes. And that gives me an idea.
- 引力创弹歪了它，力场的作用  - 是的，这给了我一个主意

133
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:36,454
What are they doing now?
他们现在在干什么？

134
00:52:41,337 --> 00:52:43,231
They're packing it away.
他们在收拾走人

135
00:52:43,395 --> 00:52:46,414
What will they cook up next?
他们下一步想炮制什么？

136
00:52:49,893 --> 00:52:55,862
How far down can this be aimed? Can it be
brought to bear on the surface of the moon?
这个最低可以瞄准哪里？能否牵引到对准月球表面？

137
00:52:56,027 --> 00:52:58,483
- I see!  - Well...
- 我明白了  - 这个...

138
00:52:58,651 --> 00:53:01,509
- Has it ever been tried?  - No, but we shall try.
- 试过这样吗？  - 没，但我们得试试

139
00:53:01,677 --> 00:53:05,625
- With Evans gone, the Gravitron is all yours.
- Je m'en occupe!
- 现在 Evans 走了，引力创归你了 - 我会处理好的（法语）

140
00:53:05,794 --> 00:53:09,054
Any further down, and the field may affect the base.
再低一点，力场就会影响基地了

141
00:53:09,224 --> 00:53:11,887
- What does that matter now?
- Ah, I suppose you're right.
- 到现在了，那又有什么关系   - 啊，我想你是对的

142
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:16,560
- Get someone to stand by that window
and relay instructions direct to Benoit.
- Right!
找个人站到那个窗户旁边，将指令转述给 Benoit

143
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:30,121
- He's ready.  - Start moving the probe down.
- 他就绪了  - 开始向下移动探测器

144
00:54:24,813 --> 00:54:27,912
- That's as far as it will go.
- What?
- 最多也就能到这个位置了
- 什么？

145
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:30,217
But it's way over their heads.
但高出他们的头太多了

146
00:54:30,382 --> 00:54:33,963
There's one chance. We'll try bringing it down by hand.
只有一次机会，我们得用手把它拉下来

147
00:54:34,136 --> 00:54:37,154
- Is this still switched off?
- No, No.. Yes, of course.
- 这个仍然是关着的吗？   - 不，不，对了，当然

148
00:54:43,054 --> 00:54:46,440
- It won't go.
- All your weight. Once more.
- 它没动  - 用上全部力气，再来一次

149
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:52,567
- It's no use. It won't shift.
- Ah, stupid of me! Of course it won't!
- 没用，它一动不动  - 啊，我真蠢，当然它不会动了

150
00:54:52,636 --> 00:54:54,872
- Why?
- The angular cut-out. It's obvious!
- 为什么？  - 角度阻断器，很显然

151
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,168
There's got to be a safety cut-out
on the angle of the probe.
探测器的角度必须得有一个安全阻断器

152
00:55:01,336 --> 00:55:03,258
Otherwise, it might affect the whole base./
否则，它就会影响整个基地

152
00:55:03,336 --> 00:55:07,258
That's done it. Stand back. Benoit can do it now.
这下可以了。往后站。Benoit 现在可以操作了

153
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,082
Switch on!
现在启动！

154
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:48,506
Well, that's taken care of the Cybermen!
好了，它可以照料赛博人了

155
00:55:48,674 --> 00:55:54,034
We've got to get this Gravitron in operation as fast as we can!
我们得尽快让引力创重新运转起来！

156
00:55:54,203 --> 00:55:57,026
- I'm so sorry we damaged it.  - What? Oh, yes...
- 很抱歉我们毁坏了它  - 什么？噢，是的...

157
00:55:58,279 --> 00:56:02,193
Nils, rig up a temporary aerial. Call up Space Control.
Nils, 架一个临时天线，联系控制中心

158
00:56:02,355 --> 00:56:07,761
Tell Rinberg we'll be operational in about two hours.
It's the best we can do.
告诉 Rinberg 我们将在大约两小时后恢复运作。最好我们也就能这样了

159
00:56:07,924 --> 00:56:13,125
Two hours! That's all we've got to 
get the world's weather under control again.
两小时，那是我们能有的时间，要让地球天气重新处于掌控之中

160
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:17,160
Benoit, take charge of your side.
And, Doctor... What the...
Benoit, 负责你那边的事情。而博士...怎么...

161
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:22,767
It's just as well. We've enough madmen here already!
这样也行吧，我们这里疯子已经够多了

162
00:56:22,937 --> 00:56:26,518
I want to see your first weather plot in two minutes!
我期望在两分钟之内见到你的天气运行图

163
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:28,022
Come on, boys.
加油，小伙子们

164
00:56:50,057 --> 00:56:51,388
Doctor, look.
博士，看

165
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:56,099
- Could that be them?  - Possibly.
- 会是他们吗？  - 很可能

166
00:56:56,272 --> 00:56:59,210
And I hope it's the last we see of them.
我期望这是我最后一次看见他们

167
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:22,988
There we are. In perfect flight.
好啦，进入完美的飞行了

168
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:28,440
- Yes, and look what happened last time!
- Just a bumpy landing. It won't happen again.
- 是啊，看看上次都发生了什么！
- 只是着陆有点颠簸，不会再发生了

169
00:57:28,608 --> 00:57:29,973
- I know.
- What you're up now?
- 我知道  - 你又在干什么？

170
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:33,160
- Let's have a look at the Time Scanner. - The what?
- 我们来看看时间扫描仪  - 看什么？

171
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:38,496
The Time Scanner. Instead of showing where we are, 
it gives you a glimpse of the future.
时间扫描仪。不是显示我们在哪儿，而是让你瞥一眼未来

172
00:57:38,657 --> 00:57:41,802
The second sight? Very dangerous.
第二视觉？这太危险了

173
00:57:41,966 --> 00:57:46,719
Nonsense! I haven't used it very much.
It's not very reliable, as you can see.
胡说！我用它的次数不多，它不是太可靠，你们可以看到

174
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,302
Doctor...
博士...

175
00:57:48,464 --> 00:57:50,277
Look!
快看！

176
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,500
