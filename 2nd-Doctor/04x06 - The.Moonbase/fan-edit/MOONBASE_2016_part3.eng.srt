1
00:29:52,231 --> 00:29:56,854
Stand back, stand back from that door.

2
00:29:58,742 --> 00:29:59,901
You're right! It is them!

3
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:10,554
Quick! Get out of it!

4
00:30:10,747 --> 00:30:11,368
No!

5
00:30:18,432 --> 00:30:19,984
Remain still.

6
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:24,662
You devils! You killed him! An unarmed man!

7
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:25,775
Get up.

8
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,823
You are known to us.

9
00:30:33,743 --> 00:30:34,640
And you to me.

10
00:30:36,905 --> 00:30:39,656
Who is in command?

11
00:30:40,147 --> 00:30:41,034
I am.

12
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:43,374
You will be needed.

13
00:30:43,797 --> 00:30:45,364
What have you done with my men?

14
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,007
They will return.

15
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:49,771
They're not dead?!

16
00:30:50,305 --> 00:30:54,689
No. They are not dead. They are altered.

17
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,394
Altered? What have you done to them?

18
00:30:56,475 --> 00:30:58,485
They are now controlled.

19
00:30:59,848 --> 00:31:01,402
If you do anything to my...

20
00:31:01,477 --> 00:31:03,114
You will do nothing.

21
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:07,976
You will now take us to the control centre.

22
00:31:08,237 --> 00:31:10,053
I'll be damned...

23
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:14,054
Through here.

24
00:31:17,452 --> 00:31:25,202
You will remain here. If you leave you will be converted like the others.

25
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:43,658
Survey party, come in, we are not receiving you, over.

26
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:50,785
Can we see the control antenna from here?

27
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,334
No, Roger. It's just around that first block just outside the main port.

28
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,647
So, we have to send somebody outside so get ready...

29
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:57,567
We have to...

30
00:31:57,773 --> 00:31:59,492
Get back! Get back! These things are lethal!

31
00:31:59,772 --> 00:32:02,324
None will move.

32
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:04,402
If you move you will be killed.

33
00:32:05,147 --> 00:32:06,732
What are they?! How did they get in!?

34
00:32:06,964 --> 00:32:11,067
Silence! We are Cybermen! 

35
00:32:11,313 --> 00:32:13,171
But you were all killed!

36
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:23,506
We are going to take over the Gravitron and use it to destroy the surface of the Earth by changing the weather.

37
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,046
But that will kill everybody on the Earth.

38
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,243
Yes.

39
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:32,039
You're supposed to be so advanced. Here you are, taking your revenge like children.

40
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:35,216
Revenge? What is that?

41
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:37,506
A feeling people have...

42
00:32:37,741 --> 00:32:49,468
Feelings? Yes, we know of this weakness of yours. We are fortunate. We do not posses feelings.

43
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:51,557
Then why are you here?

44
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,767
To eliminate all dangers.

45
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:58,348
But you kill every single thing on the Earth!

46
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:02,682
Yes. All dangers will be eliminated.

47
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:06,353
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

48
00:33:07,674 --> 00:33:09,016
You seem to be better.

49
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:10,373
Aye, I feel myself again.

50
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:11,461
Lie back there!

51
00:33:11,694 --> 00:33:12,498
But I'm better!

52
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:15,081
Oh, my head.

53
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:16,583
Well, take it easy, mate.

54
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:19,556
At least, you know it is not your McCrimmon piper.

55
00:33:19,784 --> 00:33:21,973
It had me worried though, I admit that.

56
00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:25,648
Yeah, those Cybermen have got us all worried mate. We see them in action before.

57
00:33:25,987 --> 00:33:28,269
They must have some weakness.

58
00:33:28,395 --> 00:33:31,310
Well, in my day, they used to sprinkle witches with holy water.

59
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:33,237
Fat lot of use that would be on them.

60
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,679
Sprinkle... Holy Water... Ben!

61
00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:40,094
What are the Cybermen covered in?

62
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,804
As far as I know, their suit is a metal of some sort.

63
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:48,935
What about that thing on their chests? You know the part that replaced their heart and lungs.

64
00:33:49,136 --> 00:33:50,286
Some kind of plastic I think.

65
00:33:50,909 --> 00:34:02,005
I thought so. You see, it's simple. Nail vanish remover dissolves nail vanish. Nail vanish is a plastic so we do what Jamie says, we sprinkle them, see?!

66
00:34:02,144 --> 00:34:03,848
No, clear as mud if you ask me.

67
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:05,766
Anyway, I am going to try an experiment.

68
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:08,161
Yes, Professor.

69
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,284
Dr. Evans! I thought he was dead. I thought that they were all dead!

70
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:28,903
Better if they were by the look of it.

71
00:34:39,636 --> 00:34:45,247
Tell the operators in the power unit to come out.

72
00:34:45,578 --> 00:34:46,861
Now.

73
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:59,891
All right, you can all see what is happening. Come on out, leave the machine and don't try anything.

74
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:11,009
They will now take over the Gravitron power unit.

75
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,161
Yes.

76
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:34,016
But you can't send them in their without protected helmets.

77
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:35,203
Why?

78
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:41,170
The machine produces very intense sonic fields. Without the helmets, those men will be insane in a few hours!

79
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:43,225
How many hours?

80
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:44,681
Twelve possibly.

81
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:47,426
Then there is no problem.

82
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:48,276
Why?

83
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:52,074
Our purpose will be achieved before that.

84
00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:54,371
But what about the men?

85
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:58,338
They will be disposed of.

86
00:36:06,136 --> 00:36:08,218
Now, keep your fingers crossed.

87
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:12,258
It's works!

88
00:36:12,522 --> 00:36:14,007
But I still don't know what you are on about.

89
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:18,103
If we can sprinkle some of that on their chest units, it might help to soften them.

90
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,095
I get it! You mwan it will clobber their controls or something.

91
00:36:21,298 --> 00:36:22,173
Yes, that's it.

92
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:33,076
Main power into the vortex generators now.

93
00:36:37,173 --> 00:36:39,457
What is happening?

94
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:41,902
There is loss of control.

95
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:08,799
Now look, we only have one chance at this. When I open the door, drop down as low as you can, aim this things... at their chests and squirt like mad. Right?

96
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:09,603
Right.

97
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:10,456
Get ready.

98
00:37:10,486 --> 00:37:12,688
Someone is there.

99
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,613
Quick, get their chest things!

100
00:37:41,603 --> 00:37:43,298
Quick, get these things off their heads!

101
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:56,039
Come on! Quick, there isn't a moment to lose. We got to get the Gravitron down to safe level.

102
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,287
What about those poor men?

103
00:37:57,496 --> 00:37:59,466
Shift them off to the medical unit, as quick as you can.

104
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:09,524
We are not receiving you. We are not receiving you.

105
00:38:10,517 --> 00:38:13,590
They must have failed.

106
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:20,817
Yes. We must invade now. Prepare the weapons.

107
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:22,352
Yes.

108
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:33,164
Now listen everybody. I don't know how many more of these Cybermen there are, but our point of view we are under siege. I'll reckon they will be back in a bit...

109
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:36,802
Now communications. Charlie, keep trying to get through to Earth. Right?

110
00:38:36,974 --> 00:38:37,608
Right, will do.

111
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:43,322
The rest of you, lower the armoured doors at all exits. Make up as much of that gubbins that you got, we may need it.

112
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:47,389
Mr Hobson, how far can the probe be lowered down?

113
00:38:47,717 --> 00:38:48,717
About thirty degrees.

114
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:49,524
That's no good.

115
00:38:49,677 --> 00:38:50,553
What do you mean?

116
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,435
Can any other part be lowered?

117
00:38:52,777 --> 00:38:56,271
Well, the main coil lenses can be shifted about without too much trouble but too much trouble...

118
00:38:56,565 --> 00:38:57,400
There's something outside there!

119
00:38:57,579 --> 00:38:58,227
What is it?

120
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,212
It's a long way off.

121
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:00,340
I'll come.
