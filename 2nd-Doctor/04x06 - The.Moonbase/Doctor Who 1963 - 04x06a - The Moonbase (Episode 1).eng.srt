1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,039
Doctor, do something!

3
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:38,816
I'm trying to!

4
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,277
Everything back under control again.

5
00:00:56,986 --> 00:00:58,167
Here, we're landing! Look!

6
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:00,066
Coming at a fair rate!

7
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:08,102
Oh, thank the lord for that. You know, Doctor, I'll never ask you to do that again.

8
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:13,438
There wasn't any call for that.

9
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:23,526
Anyway, Doctor, you... you've done it. It's Mars! It must be. You've landed the TARDIS exactly where you said you would.

10
00:01:46,798 --> 00:01:50,391
Hey, wait a mo! This doesn't look like Mars to me.

11
00:01:50,598 --> 00:01:52,333
How do you know? You never seen it.

12
00:01:52,555 --> 00:01:56,759
No, Duchess, but I have seen pictures of the moon surface and that's what this looks like.

13
00:01:57,194 --> 00:01:58,424
That's the moon?

14
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,023
Doctor, is it the moon?

15
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:08,754
Oh well, you weren't too far out, were you? Only two hundred million miles!

16
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:13,952
All right, let's move on - while we can.

17
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:15,814
What?

18
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:21,169
Now wait a minute! You don't expect to land us on the moon and let us fly off just like that, do you?

19
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:22,554
Yeah, at least let us have a look around!

20
00:02:22,757 --> 00:02:26,254
That picture canna be the moon? The moon's way up in the sky.

21
00:02:26,436 --> 00:02:27,525
Where do you think you're going?

22
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,108
You're not going to tell us there is no shore leave.

23
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:32,647
Oh please Doctor. The TARDIS isn't out of control or anything is it?

24
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:35,495
Oh no, no, no. Just a bumpy landing.

25
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,634
Yeah?

26
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,051
Well, if you must go ashore... only half an hour.

27
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:40,743
Right.

28
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:41,381
Super.

29
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:46,733
You can't go ashore like that! You need space suits, there's no atmosphere out there. Come on, there's some in the chest.

30
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,521
Maybe we'll meet the old man in the moon.

31
00:02:56,274 --> 00:02:58,630
You won't meet anybody mate if you don't get some gear on.

32
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:00,791
What? Oh aye.

33
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:14,812
Come on now, lets go over here.

34
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:17,394
Hey, look at this.

35
00:03:17,676 --> 00:03:19,162
Its deserted.

36
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,938
Yeah, I don't think I like it.

37
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,006
Look, over there.

38
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,554
I'll don't see anything.

39
00:03:35,238 --> 00:03:36,703
What did you see?

40
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:39,344
Some sort of great glow in the sky.

41
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:43,009
Probably your eyes getting used to the lunar light. Hey, Doctor?

42
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:44,394
Possibly.

43
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:53,663
Hey, what do we need this great clogs for?

44
00:03:53,954 --> 00:03:55,608
Try a little jump.

45
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:58,147
All right.

46
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:18,493
Careful! One tear in that space suit and you'll suffocate.

47
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:21,170
You never told me that you took ballet lessons, Ben.

48
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,082
Come on, it's easy.

49
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:32,474
Look out, here I come.

50
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:39,482
Where's he gone?

51
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,447
Over there.

52
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:50,124
What on Earth? Look!

53
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:51,872
Blimey! What is it?

54
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:53,348
Doctor, what is it?

55
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:54,932
I don't know.

56
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:56,945
Hey, I can see Jamie, there he is.

57
00:04:57,973 --> 00:04:59,613
Hey, there's somebody coming out.

58
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:02,360
Come on, let's go.

59
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:33,594
What on Earth is it?

60
00:06:35,248 --> 00:06:38,944
I don't know. Get him along to the Medical unit.

61
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:41,127
But Doctor Evans has gone down with it as well.

62
00:06:41,362 --> 00:06:45,535
Yes, I know that but the relief doctor from Earth should be here on the next shuttle. Roger.

63
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:47,287
Yes, of course. Bob, give me a hand, will you?

64
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,314
Yes, right.

65
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:57,044
And... Jules, you take over.

66
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:01,382
Come on, he won't bite you.

67
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:10,615
There must be some source to this infection. We better get the lads in here and tell them what's happening. Get them on the blower will you, Nils.

68
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:11,792
Okay Nobby.

69
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:20,532
Nils, speaking. We, er... We got a bit of a flap on up here...

70
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:26,652
Mr. Hobson wants a word with you all...

71
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:32,265
Hello. Where did you lot spring from? Don't tell me the shuttle rocket arrived already?

72
00:07:32,474 --> 00:07:33,289
No, it hasn't.

73
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:39,315
There was another one with them, sir. Bob taken him along to the Medical unit. He's all right. He's just knocked himself out or something.

74
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:43,291
Oh no, if we haven't got enough troubles already. They've been through the sterile room?

75
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:44,084
Yes, Nobby.

76
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:47,590
We don't want to cause you any trouble. Just let us collect our young friend and we'll be off.

77
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:49,595
Hey, not so fast.

78
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:51,496
Please let me go and see Jamie.

79
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:54,649
I will take you there Mademoiselle. If you come with me.

80
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,501
All right, young lady. You can carry on.

81
00:07:57,785 --> 00:07:58,419
This way.

82
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:02,165
But I just like to have a word with you two.

83
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:05,117
You can do with a extra bactical check by the look of it.

84
00:08:05,308 --> 00:08:06,235
Bactical check?

85
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:07,193
That's what I said.

86
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:08,215
Well, thanks.

87
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:10,761
I'll let you know that our TARDIS is as sterile...

88
00:08:10,994 --> 00:08:11,650
TARDIS?

89
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:12,903
Our space craft.

90
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:15,034
They're all here, sir. Any time you're ready.

91
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:21,694
Right. Well, we'll learn about your spacecraft a little later. Meanwhile, you better come along with me and meet my team and listen to what I have to say.

92
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:22,787
Thank you very much.

93
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:29,874
Well, you know what this place is?

94
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:34,754
Well, it looks like some sort of weather control centre.

95
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:39,429
Ah, yes. And that's the thing with which you control the weather. That's the culprit then.

96
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:40,314
Hey?

97
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:46,237
Hmmm. That's what gave us a bumpy landing. Some sort of gravity device.

98
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,593
Some sort of Gravity device?! You are from Earth aren't you?

99
00:08:51,594 --> 00:08:52,335
Yes.

100
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:56,782
Well, where have you been for the past 20 years. Every school kid knows about the Gravitron in there.

101
00:08:57,074 --> 00:09:01,982
Ah, yes. It must be about the year 2050, Ben.

102
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:04,709
We've got a proper Rip Van Winkle here.

103
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:07,278
It's 2070, in case you like to know.

104
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,114
There you are - I was only twenty years out.

105
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:14,198
Well, before we all forget what century we're in, I'd better tell you why I have called you here.

106
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:17,976
Won't you introduce us first. I am a Doctor.

107
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:21,474
The Doctor? You're arrived just in time. We need your help.

108
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,456
Do you?

109
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:23,834
I'll see you in a moment.

110
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:25,981
Now, this virus...

111
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:28,825
I may be able to help you if you introduce us.

112
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:40,921
Right, Doctor. You'd better meet them all. We're all scientists you see. No room for idle hands, I see to that. Roger Benoit, beside you here, is my assistant. He takes over as Chief Scientist if anything happens to me.

113
00:09:41,138 --> 00:09:55,515
He's a physicist like us and Joe Bentsburg. Nils, our mad Dane, is an astronomer and mathematician as is Charlie here. Ralph, Jules and Frances are geologists. When they are not acting as cooks, looks-outs, general... you know... handyman.

114
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:58,758
And this is where you control the Earth's weather.

115
00:09:59,003 --> 00:09:59,874
Hm-Hmm.

116
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:00,978
I see.

117
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,643
The gravitron controls the tides, the tides controls the weather.

118
00:10:04,862 --> 00:10:07,649
And from this console we can plot it all on that map.

119
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,257
Simple, eh?

120
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:10,850
Yeah, very simple.

121
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:14,604
Wish we had this back in 1966.

122
00:10:15,024 --> 00:10:16,460
Why? Was it a bad year...

123
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:21,243
It's Jim. Quick Francois, take over.

124
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:38,021
Cursor Five over the Pacific is starting to move.

125
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,167
What does that mean?

126
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,131
Some form of change in the weather.

127
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:42,946
We're soon hear from Earth what it means.

128
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:44,078
Here it comes!

129
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:49,207
International Space Control Earth calling Weather Control Moon - come in please.

130
00:10:49,397 --> 00:10:50,586
Moonport - standing by.

131
00:10:50,762 --> 00:10:53,271
It's never done that before, Doctor.

132
00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:54,279
Hobson here.

133
00:10:56,904 --> 00:11:03,874
What's happening up there? The hurricane you were guiding is now 45 degrees off course. It's threatening Hawaii.

134
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:07,333
One of my men were taken ill. We're operational again now.

135
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,218
The controller would like to know the cause of the illness.

136
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:20,033
Yes, so would we. We now have three men down with this mysterious virus in the past few hours - including the Doctor.

137
00:11:20,756 --> 00:11:26,278
One moment please. Stand by for further instructions.

138
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:32,937
Just hang on for a few moments lads. We better hear what the great Mr. Rinberg has to say.

139
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:33,995
Nobby?

140
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:34,797
Yes.

141
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:37,172
There it is again. I'll play it back to you.

142
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:44,784
"Yes, so would we. We now have three men down with this mysterious virus in the past few hours - including the Doctor. "

143
00:11:46,726 --> 00:11:53,354
"One moment please. Stand by for further instructions. "

144
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:57,882
Here the big noise ratio on that re-run. We're being monitored again.

145
00:11:58,132 --> 00:11:59,133
Monitored?

146
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:04,674
Someone, not too far away from the base, is listening to every word we say.

147
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:11,138
"Moonbase, Moonbase, come in Moonbase. "

148
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:12,966
Still standing by.

149
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:28,481
Well?

150
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:35,125
Your instruction's to send blood samples back to Earth for investigation.

151
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:41,011
Well, when can we do that? The next shuttle rocket's not for another month.

152
00:12:42,676 --> 00:12:48,347
Then they must be put on that rocket. In the meantime the Moonbase is to put into quarantine.

153
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:52,941
Quarantine! What if these men aren't fit enough to get back to work. I shall need replacements.

154
00:12:55,093 --> 00:13:01,189
If you radio information about this virus, we can do our best to identify it and suggest treatment.

155
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:03,764
I demand to speak to Rinberg.

156
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:11,180
The controller is busy - sorry. Over and out.

157
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:17,422
That whole conversion was monitored by someone or something.

158
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:25,250
Oh, never mind about that now. That Rinberg fellow won't talk to you. How can we trace down this mystery illness with the Doctor himself down with it.

159
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:29,191
We better get out of these things and see how Jamie is. Perhaps I can be of help in the sick bay.

160
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,142
Anything you can do... Bob!

161
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:32,285
Yes, Mr Hobson?

162
00:13:32,454 --> 00:13:33,594
Show them to the Medical unit will you?

163
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,921
Yes, of course. If you will come this way.

164
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,874
Yes. Thank you.

165
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:51,852
Well, you all heard the position. We don't know what this inflection is and how it got into the base but I want you all to take extra precautions while this emergency is on. We may be short-handed for quite a while.

166
00:13:52,869 --> 00:13:54,082
Is this how its goes, Doctor?

167
00:13:54,314 --> 00:13:59,407
Yes, that's right. Then, this unit automatically controls the pulse, the temperature and the breathing.

168
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:00,961
A sort of electronic Doctor.

169
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,810
Yes. Almost got stripe trousers.

170
00:14:03,992 --> 00:14:05,532
It even give you medicines too.

171
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:07,588
Yes. It will do very nearly everything.

172
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:11,667
Can't be nice to him. How do you think he is, Doctor?

173
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,992
Oh, he's not too bad. He's a bit concussed and feverish but he'll be all right with rest.

174
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:20,761
The Piper! The McCrimmon Piper! Don't let him get me!

175
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:21,846
Piper?

176
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:27,634
Some legend of his clan. As far, as I can make out - this piper appears to a McCrimmon just before he dies.

177
00:14:29,273 --> 00:14:31,149
Has this phantom piper appeared to Jamie yet?

178
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:32,768
You don't believe it, do you?

179
00:14:33,007 --> 00:14:35,154
No, but he does. It's important to him.

180
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:37,812
He keeps asking us to keep the piper away from him.

181
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:41,156
Good. We can see if we can do just that.

182
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,616
Well, carry on Nurse.

183
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:49,931
Well, at least I try to help. There's a ward full of sick men and no doctor. Somebody got to do something.

184
00:14:52,894 --> 00:14:53,955
I wonder who this is?

185
00:14:54,215 --> 00:14:57,286
Don't get too near. Have a look on his chart.

186
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:59,045
That's a good idea.

187
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:00,297
It's Dr. Evans.

188
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,237
Oh, yes. The station doctor. He was the first one to get it.

189
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:05,004
He looks one of the worst.

190
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:13,550
There's something about this epidemic that I... I just don't understand. It's not like a real disease at all! It's almost like...

191
00:15:13,736 --> 00:15:15,380
Not real! What more do you want?

192
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:19,750
I don't know. But there are certain signs and symptoms which don't add up.

193
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,014
Ben, I want you to go to the control room and keep an eye on things.

194
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:24,993
How?

195
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:28,110
Give a hand, do anything but keep your eyes and ears open.

196
00:15:28,354 --> 00:15:29,194
Right.

197
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:32,587
There's something very wrong indeed.

198
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:43,063
Still up, Nobby. Why not take a rest. Go and get some sleep.

199
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:57,834
How can I rest with that thing up the spout. You know the score as well as I do. Five units off centre and we lift half London into space! Five more and the Atlantic water level goes up three feet! Rinberg don't understand the pressure we're under.

200
00:15:58,136 --> 00:16:01,197
Hey you! What do you thinking you are doing?! Skulking here?

201
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:03,390
Just wondering if I can help, sir.

202
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,764
Well, how can you help?

203
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,270
We can do with an extra pair of hands - he can help me.

204
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:11,865
Well, keep him away from me, that's all. All right, I'll go and lie down. Call me if anything happens.

205
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,940
Yes, of course.

206
00:16:13,147 --> 00:16:18,851
Oh, by the way, there were two more of those momentary drops in air pressure while I was on. I have put them in the log.

207
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,897
Right.

208
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:31,166
Well, there are some coffee cups to clear away if you want to be helpful. And... oh and Ralph, no. 14, needs a hand down in the food store. Can you find your way there?

209
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:32,227
I'll find it.

210
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,293
Good boy.

211
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,439
Anyone would think we got rats up here.

212
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:15,678
Who's that?!

213
00:17:21,762 --> 00:17:22,874
WHO IS THAT?!

214
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:24,481
Only me, mate.

215
00:17:24,914 --> 00:17:28,542
Oh, for heaven's sake. Don't go sneaking about like that!

216
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:30,367
Blimey! You lot aren't half edgy.

217
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:33,355
You would be too, mate, if you have been up here long enough.

218
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:38,189
Say, are you responsible for the broken bags here.

219
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:40,876
Come off it, I only just arrived, haven't I?

220
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:46,255
Okay. See and you can find that lamp. Round the back, most likely.

221
00:17:46,494 --> 00:17:47,595
Okay.

222
00:17:51,700 --> 00:18:00,137
Let's see. Still need some more... Milk and Sugar.

223
00:18:17,978 --> 00:18:18,919
Ralph!

224
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:23,848
Where are you?

225
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:29,202
Scarpered. Funny bloke.

226
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:34,554
What is that?

227
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:38,429
Shhhh, it's all right Polly. It's only me. We don't want to wake everybody up do we?

228
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:47,540
You look if you can do with some sleep yourself.

229
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:50,685
I'm all right.

230
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:52,268
What have you got there?

231
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,658
Oh, I been doing a little investigation.

232
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:56,829
A piece of silver paper. What is it?

233
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:57,988
I don't know.

234
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,114
What's happened?!

235
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:03,351
Oh, it's nothing. It probably just a changeover in the time cycle.

236
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,918
What do you mean?

237
00:19:05,215 --> 00:19:11,714
Oh, you see - it's rather interesting really - you see on the moon, they have a fortnight of days and a fortnight of nights.

238
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:12,682
Well?

239
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:20,199
Well, it's oblivious isn't it? They have to make their own day and night artificially up there - or it would upset their own biological time clock.

240
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,474
Their what?

241
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,276
They won't know if they were coming or going. Get it?

242
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:26,423
Yes.

243
00:19:26,813 --> 00:19:29,525
Clever girl. QED. That's why it's dark up here.

244
00:19:30,243 --> 00:19:33,477
Oh, I see. Yes, of course. How stupid of me.

245
00:19:33,683 --> 00:19:36,514
Of course along the control centre it's probably broad daylight.

246
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:39,593
Polly, you wouldn't be making fun of me would you?

247
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:40,857
No.

248
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,172
Dr. Evans.

249
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:59,271
The hand. No, don't touch me. No. The silver hand.

250
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,245
Doctor, is he...

251
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,682
Yes, I'm afraid he is.

252
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:25,818
What are we gone to do?

253
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:30,888
What does he means by the silver hand. I better report this to Mr. Hobson.

254
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:39,486
Can't find him! Ralph!?

255
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:42,065
Well, I was helping him load some stores and he just disappeared.

256
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:45,109
What! In this place. Well, there are only nineteen of us.

257
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:46,646
Have you tried his quarters?

258
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:47,384
Yes.

259
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:48,962
Why didn't you report this to me?

260
00:20:49,154 --> 00:20:50,596
Well, I just telling you now, aren't I?

261
00:20:50,774 --> 00:20:51,647
What is it now?

262
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,121
Terribly sorry. It's Dr. Evans.

263
00:20:53,303 --> 00:20:54,002
Well?

264
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:55,373
I'm afraid he's dead.

265
00:20:55,597 --> 00:20:59,383
Dead? No.

266
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:01,434
This must be reported at once.

267
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:08,720
Yes, yes... No! No, we haven't got enough data yet. You know what they're like down there. I'll come to the sick bay with you. Come on.

268
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:14,529
Here.

269
00:21:15,384 --> 00:21:17,392
Gently, Jamie.

270
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,239
Jamie!

271
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,405
What's the matter?

272
00:21:45,626 --> 00:21:47,529
Something just went out of that door!

273
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:49,017
Nils! John!

274
00:21:49,686 --> 00:21:50,751
What was it?

275
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,330
Nothing. Nothing there.

276
00:22:04,201 --> 00:22:07,595
Your nerves are getting the better of you. Where's Evan's body?

277
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:08,821
Over there.

278
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:18,702
All right, let's get it over with.

279
00:22:24,365 --> 00:22:27,479
Is this somebody's idea of a particularly bad joke?

280
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:29,085
This is no joke, believe me!

281
00:22:29,256 --> 00:22:34,256
Mr. Hobson, Mr. Hobson, you are wanted! Another man's collapsed at the controls and the Gravitron has been thrown off alignment again.

282
00:22:34,447 --> 00:22:35,190
Come on!

283
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,263
And you better find that Doctor's body or out you all go - quarantine or no quarantine.

284
00:22:44,838 --> 00:22:52,802
I don't understand what could have happened. I must have dozed off or something but one thing I am sure of - something went out of that door just as you came in.

285
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:56,880
That body can't just have vanished. Polly, I am going to leave you alone...

286
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:58,056
...just for a minute.

287
00:22:58,685 --> 00:22:59,489
All right.

288
00:22:59,935 --> 00:23:02,802
Water. Water.

289
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,833
I'll go and get you some.

290
00:23:05,044 --> 00:23:06,161
Water!

291
00:23:35,318 --> 00:23:39,826
It's you! The phantom piper!
