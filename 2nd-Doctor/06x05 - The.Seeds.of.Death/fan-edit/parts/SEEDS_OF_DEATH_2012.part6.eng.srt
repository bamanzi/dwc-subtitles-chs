00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:05,247
It's hopeless, Doctor! 
You'll never get that thing going again!

2
00:46:05,318 --> 00:46:08,476
I'm not so sure, Jamie. After all, it's only the controls that are damaged.

3
00:46:08,638 --> 00:46:10,029
The workings are all right.

4
00:46:10,198 --> 00:46:12,468
If we can bypass the controls...

5
00:46:12,638 --> 00:46:16,790
Have you got your knife on you?
Lend it me, will you? Be careful.

6
00:46:16,958 --> 00:46:21,748
Thank you. There we are.
Now, what have we got here?

7
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:26,275
Ah, yes... Yes, yes.

8
00:46:26,438 --> 00:46:31,193
Yes, well, it's just a question
of sorting this lot out. That's all.

9
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:36,146
All is prepared, Grand Marshal.

10
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:46,792
I shall return to our ship
to finalise invasion plans.

11
00:46:50,598 --> 00:46:56,393
Right, now then, Zoe, let's see what happens when we try to connect these two together.

12
00:46:57,598 --> 00:47:00,158
No, I don't think so somehow!

13
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,309
What about these two?

14
00:47:05,398 --> 00:47:10,233
Ah! That's better! I think
I've succeeded in re-establishing

15
00:47:10,398 --> 00:47:12,628
one of these rain circuits, Jamie.

16
00:47:12,798 --> 00:47:14,789
Well, it's not raining yet!

17
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:18,492
Oh, Jamie! Weather Control
is a very difficult technology.

18
00:47:18,558 --> 00:47:20,147
You can't expect immediate results.

19
00:47:20,218 --> 00:47:25,069
- Are you sure you're getting it right?
- Yeah, I hope so, Zoe. Just have to hope for the best. That's all.

20
00:47:25,138 --> 00:47:27,688
I must get on as there's another little job I want to do.

21
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:36,675
We should have some nice heavy rain before long!

22
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:39,272
- Ah, there we are!
- Yes, the satellite.

23
00:47:39,438 --> 00:47:41,394
(ELDRED) Isn't that a beautiful sight!

24
00:47:42,798 --> 00:47:45,790
- We've finished and installed the homing device. It's working perfectly.
- Well done.

25
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:49,011
Doctor, I know we're sending up a false signal,

26
00:47:49,178 --> 00:47:52,250
but aren't some of the Martian ships bound to follow the right one?

27
00:47:52,418 --> 00:47:55,476
There isn't going to be a right one, there's going to be only ours, the wrong one,

28
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:59,277
and that's going to lead the entire Martian fleet
into an orbit round the sun!

29
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:02,228
- What about Slaar's signal?
- Obviously that has to be stopped.

30
00:48:02,348 --> 00:48:04,308
- But how?
- Well, as soon as that satellite is up

31
00:48:04,398 --> 00:48:07,747
I shall T-Mat myself to the moon
and destroy their homing device.

32
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:09,870
- They'll kill you on sight!
- No, I don't think so.

33
00:48:09,998 --> 00:48:13,235
I rigged up an interesting device here.

We're picking up the aliens'
homing signal from the moon.

37
00:48:29,338 --> 00:48:31,752
That means their invasion fleet is getting closer. There's no time to lose.

38
00:48:31,818 --> 00:48:36,512
Are you quite clear? As soon as I have succeeded destroying their signal,

39
00:48:36,778 --> 00:48:38,688
you must activate our signal in the satellite.

40
00:48:38,758 --> 00:48:40,713
- We'll be ready.
- Right, then I'll be off.

41
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:44,967
- Doctor, do be careful, won't you?
- Don't worry, Zoe, I will.

42
00:48:45,138 --> 00:48:49,177
- Are you ready, Miss Kelly?
- Doctor, our control of T-Mat hasn't been tested!

43
00:48:49,338 --> 00:48:52,136
Then now's the time to test it!
