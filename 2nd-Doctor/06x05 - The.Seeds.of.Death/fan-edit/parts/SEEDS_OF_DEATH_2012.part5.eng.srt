- Yes, I am. I think so.
- Where's Phipps?

3
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:57,290
He's dead. An Ice Warrior killed him.

4
00:35:57,361 --> 00:35:58,640
How did you manage to escape?

5
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:02,037
- The other man helped me.
- Fewsham? I thought he was working for them?

6
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:04,874
- He saved my life.
- Doesn't sound much like Fewsham.

7
00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:08,820
- He attacked the Ice Warrior. He's also got T-Mat working again.
- (DOCTOR) Do I gether we can get back to Earth?

8
00:36:08,981 --> 00:36:11,541
- I think so.

All right, Fewsham. There'll be a full inquiry when we get back to Earth. Tell them.

13
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:51,671
No more time to waste.
We must T-Mat back to Earth immediately.

14
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:55,516
- But if we all are going, who is going to dispatch us?
- There's a way of doing that.

15
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:58,712
Here, this time switch delays
transportation by ten seconds.

16
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:02,312
Oh, I see, how genius. I'll dispatch you and follow you using the time switch.

17
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:05,598
Right, so Zoe, Jamie, come along. I think this could be quite fun!

18
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:09,754
Fewsham, that time switch was down on the maintenance report for being  inoperable.

19
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:11,559
We repaired it!

21
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:19,309
In you get, Miss Kelly. I'll use the time switch.

22
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:22,196
You better hurry. Those Ice Warriors will be back any minute.

23
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:29,360
Do you know, I find T-Mat travel
rather disappointing.

24
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:31,477
There's no sensation at all!

25
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:34,031
Where have you been? And what were you being up to all this time?

26
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:36,792
Where's... Miss Kelly! What's happening up there?

27
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:39,337
Will someone tell me
what's happening down here?!

28
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:41,615
Who are these people? Is T-Mat working?

29
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:45,572
Now, please, don't... Let us just one question at a time!

30
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:48,075
Doctor, do you know there's been an alien here?

31
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:51,213
- An Ice Warrior HERE?!
- Jamie, I am not surprised.

32
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:53,372
They have taken over the whole Moonbase.

33
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:56,613
- What about the crew?
- All dead except Fewsham.

34
00:37:56,781 --> 00:38:00,251
- You left him there?
- He said he'd follow using the time switch.

35
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:03,140
He should be back.

36
00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:07,532
What's happening?

37
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:09,834
I thought so!
The time switch is still out of order.

38
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:13,590
- What? But he said he had repaired it.
- He was lying.

39
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:16,316
- Why?
- Obviously he's working for them!

40
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:19,472
Then why did he let us escape?

41
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:28,511
(HISSING, LABOURED BREATHING)

42
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,440
(HISSING, LABOURED BREATHING)

43
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:12,173
But don't you see, gentlmen? 
The invasion of Moonbase,
the taking over of T-Mat, 

44
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:16,050
the seed pods, the arrival of the Ice Warrior,
they're all part of the same plan.

45
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,700
Plan? What plan?

46
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:21,631
These incidents seem unrelated.
This fungus everywhere,
what's that got to do with it?

47
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:24,454
I'm not quite sure yet. Have you people been able to make anything of it?

48
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:28,734
It's indestructible.
We've attacked it with every possible way, but without success.

49
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:31,495
Yes, but have you tried to understand it?

50
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,334
You suggest we should psychoanalyse it, Doctor?

51
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:38,779
I'm merely suggesting that rather than destroy it, you should
find out its composition and purpose.

52
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:41,751
I have some laboratory equipment
in my workshop. You could use that.

53
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:44,614
- Good. Then we need a sample.
- No problem about that.

54
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:47,275
- The gardens are full of the stuff.
- Fine. The let no time to be lost.

55
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:48,965
I'll get some equipment for you.

56
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:52,850
Doctor, do be careful. Those pod things are deadly.

57
00:39:52,921 --> 00:39:56,038
Don't worry. I've already had experience. I'll be careful.

58
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:02,657
(DOCTOR) Yes... It's organic.

59
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:04,812
It's alive.

60
00:40:04,981 --> 00:40:07,814
It's definitely a fungus composition.

61
00:40:07,981 --> 00:40:11,615
- Are you sure this is correct?
- As far as I can make out, it is.

62
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:15,276
A molecule of five atoms...absorbs oxygen.

63
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:18,438
You know,  a complete blanket of this

64
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:23,199
would reduce the oxygen content
of the Earth's atmosphere drastically.

65
00:40:23,261 --> 00:40:26,936
According to my calculations,
to one twentieth normal.

66
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:30,299
It would make the Earth's atmosphere
uninhabitable to the human race,

67
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,680
but exactly like the atmosphere of Mars!

68
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:39,752
Look at that. Even without vegetation
to feed on, it's still active. Oh!

69
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:42,879
(ELDRED) If that thing explodes here, the fumes will kill us! Come on, Doctor!

70
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,714
Just a minute. There must be some way of...

71
00:40:51,441 --> 00:40:54,831
(ELDRED) Come on!
(DOCTOR) Sulphuric acid!

72
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,356
Hydrochloric acid!

73
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:01,312
Acetic acid!

74
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:13,192
(ELDRED) You've done it!

75
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:16,034
Well, what was it? What did you throw on it?

76
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:21,451
- You really think it would work?
- Well It could be less effective than Moonbase, of course.

which handles up to two million microwave channels simultaneously,

78
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:26,675
the satellite would just take a few thousand.

79
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:28,791
That would be enough for vital food supplies.

80
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:32,410
But we can't use normal communications satellites.
They are not programmed for T-Mat.

81
00:41:32,581 --> 00:41:34,474
No. We have to send up a specially       programmed one.

82
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,151
That would mean using a rocket, wouldn't it? I thought no one use them nowadays.

83
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:40,814
Not manned rockets, but we do send up satellites for communications.

84
00:41:40,981 --> 00:41:44,796
- How soon can you get one up?
- Well, I don't know. If we're given top priority...

<i>- Water! Ordinary water!</i>

<i>- There's no time to explain now.</i>

00:42:41,081 --> 00:42:43,952
- What do you want me to do?
- <i>Get hold of the Weather Control Bureau people</i>

101
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:47,655
<i>and to make rain, as much rain as possible</i>
<i>over the entire country!</i>

- Yes.
- Quickly! Manage it. It's vital!

Of course not, but since their fuel
supplies are at a marginal level,
