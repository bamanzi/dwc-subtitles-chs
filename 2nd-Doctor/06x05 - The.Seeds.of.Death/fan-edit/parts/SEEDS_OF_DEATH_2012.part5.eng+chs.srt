00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:31,795
I realise the importance of that.
If we overshoot the moon,
我明白这个的重要性．如果我们跑偏了

129
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:36,591
nothing will stop them from going
straight into an orbit around the sun.
他们就会直接进入太阳轨道, 没有什么能拦得住

130
00:44:36,761 --> 00:44:38,752
They will not overshoot!
他们不会跑偏！

131
00:44:38,921 --> 00:44:43,312
Of course not, but since their fuel
supplies are at a marginal level,
当然不会, 但他们的燃料并不是太多

132
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:47,918
if anything did go wrong,
they'd never be able to regain moon orbit.
如果出现什么意外, 他们无法重新进入月球轨道

133
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:59,630
This video device is operating!
这个视频设备在运转！

134
00:44:59,801 --> 00:45:02,554
You have betrayed us!

<i>(COMPUTER) Countdown in minus three minutes.</i>

139
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:30,072
Cancel the launch! We can use that
satellite to mislead the Martian fleet!
取消发射！我们可以用那个火箭将火星舰队引开！

140
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:34,972
Don't you see? Poor Fewsham deliberately
let us overhear their homing signal.
你没明白吗？可怜的 Fewsham 有意让我们听到了他们的引导信号

141
00:45:35,141 --> 00:45:39,612
We can imitate that signal
with a homing device in the satellite!
我们可以用一个引导装置模拟那个信号, 再把引导装置装进火箭里

142
00:45:39,861 --> 00:45:44,412
Commander Radnor, top priority message
to satellite launching site!
我是指挥官 Radnor, 给火箭发射场发送最高优先级的消息！

- <i>(COMPUTER) Message understood.</i>
- 取消发射！重复, 取消发射！  - 消息已收到

如果我们能把他们的舰队引开, 这场仗我们就赢了一半了

145
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:55,979
- But still, that fungus stuff is everywhere.
- We solved that one with H2O - water!
- 但是, 那些泡沫还是到处都是  - 我们已经发现H2O可以解决那个问题 - 水！

146
00:45:56,141 --> 00:46:00,293
Water? Well, all we need to do is to make it rain!
水？那, 我们唯一要做的就是造雨！
