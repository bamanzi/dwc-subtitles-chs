I can assure you I've never met them before in my life.

105
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:33,159

you turn up on their very heels!

would be financed by government funds!

You could have come over with me.
We are friends. You can join us.

115
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:03,357
Yes, and worked as Miss Kelly's assistant perhaps

We don't miss very much, you know.

120
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,680

137
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:13,778
and a large sum of government funds
wouldn't come amiss, would they?

138

To go to the moon? We'd probably overshoot
by a few million years!

161
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:55,355
Yes, or by a few million miles!

162
00:09:55,524 --> 00:09:58,596
I'm afraid the Tardis is not suited to short-range travel.

163
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,573
Still I think we should help them if we can.

164

- Aye.  - Yes.

165
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:10,243
- Well, I think I could get your rocket to the moon.  - You?

166
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:14,399
Yes, I have considerable experience in space travel,
and so have my two companions.

Doctor, that's splendid! Thank you!

00:10:16,024 --> 00:10:20,717

00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:23,657
How much more work is required?

170
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,896
It needs fuel and a complete computerised check.

- I can order that.
- No! I would not allow it! The risk is too great!

If there was some other way,

173
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:34,302

- Yes, Miss Kelly?

201
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:23,556
Do you think it's wise letting
these people crew the rocket?

202
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:26,736
Wise? No, of course it is not wise.
But what's the alternative?

203
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:28,236
We gave up training astronauts years ago.

204
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:31,514
- But Who are they?
- Some of Eldred's crazy friends, I imagine,

205
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,718
But the man who calls himeself the Doctor
said he knows this space travel.

206
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:36,554
- How can you be sure?

207
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,202
He and the girl know more
about space flight than Eldred.

208
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:42,634
- What about the boy?
- Yes, I'm not sure about him.

- Yes!

213

Commander, I think I should go as crew on the rocket.

214

Don't be ridiculous, you're too valuable here!

215

- Osgood's dead.

- He's incapable of doing it! I think I should go!

No! You're the only one who really understands T-Mat.

Don't worry, Miss Kelly we'll be perfectly all right!

Osgood, it must have been space madness.

He just went berserk! Pretty mad.
It was terrifying.

272

Osgood? But he'd be the last man, I'd have thought!

00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:19,064
- So did we.
- Where are the others?

00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:22,829
When Osgood fused the controls,
Locke tried to stop him.

- Osgood killed him.
- This is fantastic!

- He was injured too and I put him under sedation.

Jamie and I have met them before.
They come from the planet Mars.

- What do they want?
- Mars is a dying planet.

- I imagine that they want a new home.
- Why the moon?

- I think it's just a stepping stone.
- What did you say? They're...Ice Warriors?

Yes, you know, Mars is a cold planet
and they've adapted to that.

- Oh!

338
00:20:41,476 --> 00:20:44,471
- Mr Phipps, I presume?
- Yes, but where did you come from?

339
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:47,814
From the rocket. We were talking on the radio.

340
00:20:47,976 --> 00:20:51,188
- Thank heavens you've made it. Are the others here too?
- Yeah, They're still in the rocket.

341
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:55,149
- How many Ice Warriors are there?
- Those creatures you mean?

342
00:20:55,216 --> 00:20:58,328
- Not many, but they're deadly.
- They have their weak points.

343
00:20:58,396 --> 00:21:02,631
Look, they've killed everybody here,
except Fewsham, who's helping them.

344
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:06,069
I see. Well, there's only one thing for it.

345
00:21:06,136 --> 00:21:09,024
- We shall have to destroy T-Mat.

346
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:14,451
You will shortly dispatch a cargo
to certain cities on Earth.

347
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:16,853
Cargo? What sort of cargo?

348
00:21:24,896 --> 00:21:28,491
That's an Ice Warrior.
It's got Miss Kelly, but how...?

349
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:32,892
Run!

350
00:22:40,336 --> 00:22:41,735
Oh!

351
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,575

352
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:48,967

361
00:23:19,716 --> 00:23:23,391
This human was in the corridors.

362

363

and bring her back here!

365

- He's not one of the crew.

366
00:23:37,156 --> 00:23:39,590
I don't know this man.
He must have just arrived here.

367
00:23:39,756 --> 00:23:43,112
Impossible - we control T-Mat.
How did you get here?

368
00:23:43,276 --> 00:23:46,348
Our resources are not limited
to T-Mat, you know!

369
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:51,207
- You arrived by other means? By space craft?
- Rockets haven't been used for years.

370
00:23:51,276 --> 00:23:53,665
Then you are lying!

371

There is no defence against our plans.

386
00:25:09,356 --> 00:25:12,985
All I know is they want me to send
something to Earth by T-Mat.

387
00:25:13,156 --> 00:25:16,944
- I suppose that's what's in it.
- I shall have to look inside,

388

389
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:21,109
The Doctor's been captured?
But couldn't you help him?

390
00:25:21,296 --> 00:25:23,809
I'm sorry, but there was nothing we could do.

391
00:25:23,876 --> 00:25:26,573
- We had a job to reach here ourselves.
- Aye. So did we!

392
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:28,190
Are you sure the Ice Warriors
don't know about this place?

393
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:31,101
- One of them did find it, but I managed to deal with it.
- How?

394
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,301
I fixed up some kind of a booby trap
to the solar energy power line.

- That's right!

The heating system of the entire base
is controlled from the Centre.

398
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,350
Now if we can reach those control,
we can turn up the heating.

399
00:25:44,516 --> 00:25:47,147
But how can we get there?
Ice Warriors are patrolling those corridors.

00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:06,820
He attacked the Ice Warrior.
He's also got T-Mat working again./?

505
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:08,820
(DOCTOR) Do I gether we can get back to Earth?

506
00:36:08,981 --> 00:36:11,541
- I think so.
- Let's not waste any more time!

507
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
<i>(Weather Control Center)</i>

508
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:45,457
I had to help them or they would have killed me!

509
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:48,030
All right, Fewsham. There'll be a full inquiry
when we get back to Earth. Tell them.

510
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:51,671
No more time to waste.
We must T-Mat back to Earth immediately.

511
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:53,516
But if we all are going, who is going to dispatch us?

512
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:58,712
There's a way of doing that. Here, this time switch
delays transportation by ten seconds.

513
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:02,312
- Oh, I see, how genius.
- I'll dispatch you and follow you using the time switch.

514
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:05,598
Right, so Zoe, Jamie, come along.
I think this could be quite fun!

515
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:09,754
Fewsham, that time switch was down
on the maintenance report for being inoperable.

516
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:11,559
We repaired it!

517
00:37:11,721 --> 00:37:14,519
(TRILLING)

518
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:19,309
In you get, Miss Kelly.
I'll use the time switch.

519
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:22,196
You better hurry.
Those Ice Warriors will be back any minute.

520
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:29,360
Do you know, I find T-Mat travel rather disappointing.

521
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:31,477
There's no sensation at all!

522
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:34,031
Where have you been?
And what were you being up to all this time?

523
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:36,792
Where's... Miss Kelly! What's happening up there?

524
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:39,337
Will someone tell me what's happening down here?!

525
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:41,615
Who are these people? Is T-Mat working?

526
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:45,572
Now, please, don't...
Let us just one question at a time!

527
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:48,075
Doctor, do you know there's been an alien here?

528
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:51,213
- An Ice Warrior HERE?!
- Jamie, I am not surprised.

529
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:53,372
They have taken over the whole Moonbase.

530
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:56,613
- What about the crew?
- All dead except Fewsham.

531
00:37:56,781 --> 00:38:00,251
- You left him there?
- He said he'd follow using the time switch.

532
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:03,140
He should be back.

533
00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:07,532
What's happening?

534
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:09,534
I thought so! The time switch is still out of order.

535
00:38:09,651 --> 00:38:13,590
- What? But he said he had repaired it.
- He was lying.

536
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:16,316
- Why?  - Obviously he's working for them!

537
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:19,472
Then why did he let us escape?

538
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:28,511
(HISSING, LABOURED BREATHING)

539
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,440
(HISSING, LABOURED BREATHING)

540
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:09,373
But don't you see, gentlmen?

541
00:39:09,441 --> 00:39:13,273
The invasion of Moonbase,
the taking over of T-Mat, the seed pods,

542
00:39:13,341 --> 00:39:16,050
the arrival of the Ice Warrior,
they're all part of the same plan.

543
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,700
Plan? What plan?

544
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:19,331
These incidents seem unrelated.

545
00:39:19,461 --> 00:39:21,631
This fungus everywhere,
what's that got to do with it?

546
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:24,454
I'm not quite sure yet. Have your people
been able to make anything of it?

547
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:28,734
It's indestructible. We've attacked it
with every possible way, but without success.

548
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:31,495
Yes, but have you tried to UNDERSTAND it?

549
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,334
You suggest we should psychoanalyse it, Doctor?

550
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:38,779
I'm merely suggesting that rather than destroy it,
you should find out its composition and purpose.

551
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:41,751
I have some laboratory equipment
in my workshop. You could use that.

552
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:44,614
- Good. Then we need a sample.
- No problem about that.

553
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:47,275
- The gardens are full of the stuff.
- Fine. The let no time to be lost.

554
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:48,965
I'll get some equipment for you.

555
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:52,850
Doctor, do be careful. Those pod things are deadly.

556
00:39:52,921 --> 00:39:56,038
Don't worry. I've already had experience.
I'll be careful.

557
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:02,657
(DOCTOR) Yes... It's organic.

558
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:04,812
It's alive.

559
00:40:04,981 --> 00:40:07,814
It's definitely a fungus composition.

560
00:40:07,981 --> 00:40:11,615
- Are you sure this is correct?
- As far as I can make out, it is.

561
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:15,276
A molecule of five atoms...absorbs oxygen.

562
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:18,438
You know, a complete blanket of this

563
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:23,199
would reduce the oxygen content
of the Earth's atmosphere drastically.

564
00:40:23,261 --> 00:40:26,936
According to my calculations,
to one twentieth normal.

565
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:30,299
It would make the Earth's atmosphere
uninhabitable to the human race,

566
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,680
but exactly like the atmosphere of Mars!

567
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:39,752
Look at that. Even without vegetation
to feed on, it's still active. Oh!

568
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:42,879
(ELDRED) If that thing explodes here,
the fumes will kill us! Come on, Doctor!

569
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,714
Just a minute. There must be some way of...

570
00:40:51,441 --> 00:40:54,831
- (ELDRED) Come on!
- (DOCTOR) Sulphuric acid!

571
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,356
Hydrochloric acid!

572
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:01,312
Acetic acid!

573
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:13,192
(ELDRED) You've done it!

574
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:16,034
Well, what was it? What did you throw on it?

575
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:21,451
- You really think it would work?
- Well It could be less effective than Moonbase, of course.

576
00:41:21,621 --> 00:41:24,419
which handles up to two million
microwave channels simultaneously,

577
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:26,675
the satellite would just take a few thousand.

578
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:28,791
That would be enough for vital food supplies.

579
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:32,410
But we can't use normal communications satellites.
They are not programmed for T-Mat.

580
00:41:32,581 --> 00:41:34,474
No. We have to send up a specially programmed one.

581
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,151
That would mean using a rocket, wouldn't it?
I thought no one use them nowadays.

582
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:40,814
Not manned rockets, but we do send up
satellites for communications.

583
00:41:40,981 --> 00:41:44,796
- How soon can you get one up?
- Well, I don't know. If we're given top priority...

00:41:44,821 --> 00:41:50,691
(HISSING, LABOURED BREATHING)

585
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,933
There!

586
00:41:59,941 --> 00:42:02,091
(FEWSHAM) What is it?

587
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:04,650
A communications unit from our ship.

588
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:08,771
Connect it to the solar batteries!

589
00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:13,033
<i>(DOCTOR) Is Commander Radnor there, please?</i>

590
00:42:13,201 --> 00:42:17,972
- <i>Oh, Zoe, is Radnor there?</i>
- He's in conference with Miss Kelly and Sir James Gregson.

591
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:21,358
<i>Oh, I see. Zoe. There's the most wonderful news!</i>

592
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:23,974
<i>We've found a way of destroying the fungus!</i>

593
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,909
- Oh! What is it?
- <i>Water! Ordinary water!</i>

594
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:29,834
- Oh, Doctor, surely...
- <i>There's no time to explain now.</i>

595
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:33,398
<i>Apparently, there is a Weather Control Bureau somewhere.</i>

596
00:42:33,561 --> 00:42:35,392
<i>I want you to get in touch with them.</i>

597
00:42:35,561 --> 00:42:37,975
Can't you reach them on the video phone?

598
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:40,917
<i>No, I've tried. They are not answering,
or it's broken down or something.</i>

599
00:42:41,081 --> 00:42:43,952
- What do you want me to do?
- <i>Get hold of the Weather Control Bureau people</i>

600
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:47,655
<i>and to make rain, as much rain as possible</i>
<i>over the entire country!</i>

601
00:42:52,481 --> 00:42:55,393
- Well, where is everybody?
- I don't know.

602
00:42:55,561 --> 00:42:57,791
Let's find the main control room. Come on.

603
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:07,238
So that's why no one answered the video phone.

604
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:09,392
And look at that!

605
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:14,614
No, it's no good. They're locked in position.

<i>the gravitational field of the moon.</i>

- Everything is ready.

00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:28,989

612
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:44,576
<i>Shouldn't we test the directional beam?</i>

613
00:43:44,741 --> 00:43:49,132
<i>- It is not necessary!</i>
<i>- But it's operating on Moonbase power.</i>

614
00:43:49,301 --> 00:43:51,511
<i>I can't guarantee the pulsing rate will be the same.</i>

615
00:43:51,681 --> 00:43:54,556
<i>Very well. Test it!</i>

616
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:59,032
Commander Radnor, can this be recorded?

617
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:01,192
- Yes.  - Quickly! Manage it. It's vital!

618
00:44:01,361 --> 00:44:04,194

I realise the importance of that.
If we overshoot the moon,

628
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:36,591
nothing will stop them from going
straight into an orbit around the sun.

They will not overshoot!

630
00:44:38,921 --> 00:44:43,312
Of course not, but since their fuel
supplies are at a marginal level,

631
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:47,918
if anything did go wrong,
they'd never be able to regain moon orbit.

It's hopeless, Doctor!
You'll never get that thing going again!

647

Ah, yes... Yes, yes.

Yes, well, it's just a question
of sorting this lot out. That's all.

Right, now then, Zoe, let's see what happens

- Yeah, I hope so, Zoe.

665
00:47:22,118 --> 00:47:25,069
Just have to hope for the best. That's all.

666
00:47:25,138 --> 00:47:27,688
I must get on as there's another little job I want to do.

667
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:36,675
We should have some nice heavy rain before long!

668

- Ah, there we are!
- Yes, the satellite.

(ELDRED) Isn't that a beautiful sight!

670
00:47:42,798 --> 00:47:45,790
We've finished and installed the homing device.
It's working perfectly.

671
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:49,011
Doctor, I know we're sending up a false signal,

672
00:47:49,178 --> 00:47:52,250
but aren't some of the Martian ships
bound to follow the right one?

673
00:47:52,418 --> 00:47:55,476
There isn't going to be a right one,
there's going to be only ours, the wrong one,

674
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:59,277
and that's going to lead the entire Martian fleet
into an orbit round the sun!

675
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:02,228
- What about Slaar's signal?
- Obviously that has to be stopped.

676
00:48:02,348 --> 00:48:04,308
- But how?
- Well, as soon as that satellite is up

677
00:48:04,398 --> 00:48:07,747
I shall T-Mat myself to the moon
and destroy their homing device.

678
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:09,870
- They'll kill you on sight!
- No, I don't think so.

679
00:48:09,998 --> 00:48:13,235

That means their invasion fleet is getting closer.
There's no time to lose.

Are you quite clear? As soon as
I have succeeded destroying their signal,

685
00:48:36,778 --> 00:48:38,688
you must activate our signal in the satellite.

686
00:48:38,758 --> 00:48:40,713

- Right, then I'll be off.

- Don't worry, Zoe, I will.

00:48:45,138 --> 00:48:49,177
- Are you ready, Miss Kelly?
- Doctor, our control of T-Mat hasn't been tested!
