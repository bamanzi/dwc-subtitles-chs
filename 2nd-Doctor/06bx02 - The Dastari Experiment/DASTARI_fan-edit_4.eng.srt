1
00:00:29,587 --> 00:00:32,980
- Now, you come along with me, sir!
- How dare you?! Let go of me!

2
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:35,436
- This way!
- No, this way!

3
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:41,682
- Now, look. You got me into this mess!
- Will you please stop squabbling?

4
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:45,075
We'll go this way.

5
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:50,945
(CHESSENE) No!

6
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:57,416
You'll come this way! We have
some unfinished business to attend to.

7
00:01:45,747 --> 00:01:48,136
My word, what a mess!

8
00:01:48,307 --> 00:01:53,222
I think perhaps, Dastari,
you ought to sack your chatelaine (!)

9
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:58,380
Shockeye! What has happened here?

10
00:01:58,547 --> 00:02:05,180
It seems that Group Marshal Stike
vaporized his space craft and himself.

11
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:07,258
I found this.

12
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:12,226
- So he survived the coronic acid.
- Obviously.

13
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:14,025
Down to the cellars.

14
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:19,182
You know the way, I think.

15
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:33,899
The control box has been moved. Is it damaged?

16
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:36,661
The briode nebuliser is missing.

17
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:40,782
Do you mean this?

18
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,105
Why did you remove it?

19
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:47,464
Because it contains my symbiotic print.

20
00:02:50,787 --> 00:02:54,746
- Return this to the machine.
- How did your imprint get into this?

21
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:58,183
Stike forced me to prime
and use the machine.

22
00:02:58,347 --> 00:03:02,898
There is a simple way of testing
whether you are still trying to deceive us.

23
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:05,706
Come, girl.

24
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,978
Now we shall see.

25
00:03:19,787 --> 00:03:22,938
(WHIRRING)

26
00:03:24,027 --> 00:03:25,938
There you are.

27
00:03:26,987 --> 00:03:32,584
Kartz and Reimer's subjects
always vapourised into the time stream.

28
00:03:32,747 --> 00:03:38,026
Peri won't. And she hasn't
any symbiotic nuclei, I can assure you.

29
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:45,058
(WHIRRING)

30
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,978
Out!

31
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,978
Satisfied?

32
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:03,105
Dastari, chain these creatures up.

33
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:07,738
Chain us up? After I've handed you
the secret of time travel on a plate!

34
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:11,138
Come on, Chessene. Where's your gratitude?

35
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:13,616
(CHESSENE) Dastari.

36
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,982
Come on.

37
00:04:17,787 --> 00:04:23,339
Ooh, madam, before we leave,
let me cook one of the humans.

38
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:27,102
Didn't you sate your appetite
sufficiently in the city?

39
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:32,295
A mere snack. You promised we could
have a human before leaving Earth!

40
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:35,425
Well, if it would please you.

41
00:04:36,307 --> 00:04:40,778
Take the one in the skirt.
He is the youngest of the jacks.

42
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,744
Thank you, madam!

43
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:54,460
- Get your hands off me!
- Steady, my beauty!

44
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,779
Oh, there's some juiceful meat
on this one, Chessene!

45
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:01,177
(JAMIE'S DOCTOR) Jamie!

46
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:13,776
You might at least say goodbye!

47
00:05:17,187 --> 00:05:20,259
You're almost as clever as I am!

48
00:05:20,427 --> 00:05:22,463
What does he mean?

49
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:25,983
I presume you've sabotaged
the briode nebuliser?

50
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:29,935
- Pared the interface.
- Precisely what I would have done.

51
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:31,984
But it worked, didn't it?

52
00:05:32,147 --> 00:05:35,219
I left a thin membrane
so that it would work once.

53
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:39,141
- I knew she'd want to test it!
- There's no need to be so smug.

54
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:43,619
- We've got to rescue Jamie!
- (BOTH) Can you reach that wheelchair?

55
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:47,382
- I'm not elastic!
- You'll reach it with your feet if you try.

56
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,538
(PERI'S DOCTOR) Good girl!

57
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:52,744
- What's the idea?
- Push it over towards him.

58
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:55,137
Why? He's not going anywhere in it!

59
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:57,980
Come along! That's it!

60
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:11,502
- What do you think?
- It might work. It's worth a try.

61
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:16,058
Easy...

62
00:06:16,227 --> 00:06:18,695
Easy does it...

63
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:27,778
Well done!

64
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,740
- (JAMIE YELLS)
- Never mind me, help him!

65
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:49,978
The key!

66
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:55,378
(AGONISED YELL)

67
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:59,335
- What are you doing?
- Tenderising the meat.

68
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:04,535
See how the flesh is marbling?
That's the fatty tissue breaking up.

69
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:07,505
You should kill him first, surely?

70
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:10,943
It works better on a live animal.

71
00:07:11,107 --> 00:07:13,496
- Aagh!
- It looks very painful.

72
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:18,660
That's simply a nervous reflex.
I've been butchering all my life.

73
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:23,378
Primitive creatures don't feel pain
in the way that we would.

74
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:25,981
(AGONISED YELL)

75
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:36,266
Now, this is the part, I always say,
where you can tell a butcher from a botcher!

76
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:39,624
The meat should always have a clean edge.

77
00:07:39,787 --> 00:07:45,305
One of the Time Lords has escaped!
You didn't fasten the manacle!

78
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:47,458
- I did!
- Don't argue!

79
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:50,221
It's vital that he be caught and killed!

80
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:54,300
To kill a Time Lord would destroy
everything we've achieved!

81
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:58,016
The Gallifreyans have powers
we've not even dreamed of.

82
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,984
Kill him, I tell you!

83
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,978
KILL HIM!

84
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:10,020
This will only take a few minutes. We could
have the saddle and haunches for supper.

85
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:14,658
Never mind that now, Shockeye!
I want that Time Lord found!

86
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:31,338
- Jamie! Can you hear me?
- (JAMIE GROANS)

87
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:39,102
Jamie! Wake up!

88
00:08:42,987 --> 00:08:47,265
I thought you might return to help the primitive!

89
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:49,746
Agh!

90
00:09:02,387 --> 00:09:06,858
- Shockeye! The Time Lord!
- I know, madam. I wounded him!

91
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:08,540
Look!

92
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:14,818
Then follow his blood trail.

93
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,978
Kill him, Shockeye.

94
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:19,342
Certainly, madam!

95
00:09:49,787 --> 00:09:52,779
Come along, Peri. It's time we were off.

96
00:09:54,947 --> 00:09:58,064
Chessene wants me to kill you.

97
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:09,663
Your run is nearly ended, Time Lord!

98
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:18,695
Give up, Time Lord! You cannot escape
Shockeye o' the Quancing Grig!

99
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:32,321
(GROANS)

100
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:46,479
Right! I'll have that Shockeye, so I will!

101
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:06,379
(DASTARI) I remember it very clearly, Doctor.

102
00:11:06,547 --> 00:11:09,937
There speaks the real Dastari. My old friend!

103
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:14,498
I ordered you to kill these two.
Why are they still alive?

104
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:18,785
There's been enough killing,
Chessene, and it's my fault.

105
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:23,259
I took an Androgum,
a lowly, unthinking creature of instinct,

106
00:11:23,427 --> 00:11:25,577
and tried to set her among the gods!

107
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:29,296
I put myself among the gods!
I shall liberate my people.

108
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:32,459
We shall reign over all other beings!

109
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:37,378
Stop!

110
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:50,497
(WHIRRING)

111
00:11:55,587 --> 00:11:58,260
Agh!

112
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:03,539
(PERI) Is she dead?
(DOCTOR) Very.

113
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:08,337
Molecular disintegration. Horrible!

114
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:13,023
- That's it, then.
- Except for that Shockeye!

115
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:15,860
He's been...mothballed (!)

116
00:12:16,787 --> 00:12:21,577
That's a mess! It'll take you quite a while
to put that back together again!

117
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:24,466
That will not be necessary.

118
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:29,938
A Stattenheim remote control!
I've always wanted one of those!

119
00:12:30,107 --> 00:12:33,179
Some of us have earned these little privileges!

120
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,139
(WHISTLES)

121
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:39,299
(WHOOSHING)

122
00:12:44,187 --> 00:12:46,337
- Jamie...
- After you, Doctor.

123
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:48,737
No, after you, Jamie.

124
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:50,898
- Goodbye, Peri.
- Bye.

125
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:59,102
- Doctor.
- Keep an eye on the old gentleman, will you?

126
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:03,863
Do try to keep out of my way in future
and in past, there's a good fellow.

127
00:13:04,027 --> 00:13:08,737
The time continuum should be
big enough for both of us...just!

128
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:11,262
I preferred you as an Androgum!

129
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:18,937
(WHOOSHING)
