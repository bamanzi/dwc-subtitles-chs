1
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:46,419
The next step
is partially to detach the occipital bone.

2
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,576
- (PERI) Hello!
- Wait!

3
00:00:56,787 --> 00:00:58,584
American students?

4
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:05,459
Yes, we're planning to send parties every year.
I'm surveying the district for accommodation.

5
00:01:05,627 --> 00:01:09,359
Can I ask, do you live alone
or are there other occupants?

6
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,518
I live alone.

7
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:15,919
Apart from my servant.
Wait here, young woman.

8
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:22,920
We could eat her tonight.
I could make a piquant sauce!

9
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:27,478
Perhaps we shall,
but first I must test my suspicions.

10
00:01:27,647 --> 00:01:29,126
What suspicions?

11
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:33,758
The human mind is so flabby
and vague, it is hard to read,

12
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:38,796
but she was constantly thinking of the Doctor.

13
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:41,959
- Huh?
- The Doctor.

14
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:46,484
She could have no knowledge of the Doctor.
How would that be possible?

15
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:49,480
Have Dastari bring him through the hall.

16
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:53,879
If there is a connection, she will
give herself away when she sees him.

17
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,242
And then we can cook her!

18
00:01:56,487 --> 00:02:01,800
You heard what Shockeye said.
Chessene wants him taken upstairs!

19
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:05,441
- Her orders were quite clear.
- And I order you to continue the operation!

20
00:02:05,607 --> 00:02:10,244
- I will not tolerate further delay.
- Force will get you nowhere, Stike.

21
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:16,401
If you kill me, you lose all chance
of learning the Time Lord's genetic secret.

22
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:24,242
Very well, but tell Chessene if the operation
is not completed by the end of the day,

23
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:28,320
I shall return to my unit
and leave none of you alive here!

24
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:30,876
Varl! Come!

25
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:33,436
Militaristic buffoon!

26
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:36,519
Chessene will deal with him.

27
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:41,762
- Have you ever eaten a Sontaran?
- Certainly not!

28
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:48,958
No, nor have I. They always
seem so tough and tasteless.

29
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,403
Help me lift him into the wheelchair.

30
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:56,757
- How many bedrooms?
- Seven.

31
00:02:58,407 --> 00:03:01,160
I thought you said you lived alone?

32
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:03,158
Visitors.

33
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:08,042
Take him through.

34
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:13,317
Is he all right?

35
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:16,285
He has had rather a tiring time lately.

36
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,638
Madam.

37
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:25,200
Show this young woman round. She might
be particularly interested in the kitchens.

38
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,358
A pleasure, madam.

39
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:30,997
Thank you, but I think I have
all the information I need.

40
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:33,158
Come!

41
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:37,363
My friends will be waiting for me.

42
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:41,596
If she has friends,
they will come enquiring after her.

43
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:46,077
I think that was a lie.
Animals always scent danger.

44
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:49,159
They have to be dragged to the abattoir!
1
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:07,919
- Who has done this to you, Stike?
- A Time Lord.

2
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:11,477
Impossible! How could
the Time Lords have traced us?

3
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:15,765
It's the truth. I did not do this to myself!

4
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:19,920
The Doctor's companion at the Space Station
had a knife like that.

5
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:24,683
- Doctor!
- Jamie!

6
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:28,122
There you are, Jamie!

7
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:39,441
(CHESSENE) They've escaped.
(STIKE) Typical cowardice!

8
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:41,677
They'll come back. They have to.

9
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:45,999
Dastari, come with me.
Stike, you and Varl search the area.

10
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:53,276
That Androgum has given its last order!

11
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:57,850
- (DOOR OPENS)
- Someone's coming!

12
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:02,404
- Too late!
- Up the stairs! Extemporise!

13
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:12,903
Wake up, old Time Lord.
Supper will soon be served!

14
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:22,280
Now that the Time Lords have located us,
we must move quickly.

15
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,917
- The operation cannot be hurried.
- I'm aware of that.

16
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:30,765
I have a contingency plan.

17
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:34,806
- It's been in my mind for some time.
- What contingency plan?

18
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:40,564
I want you to turn this Time Lord
into an Androgum. You could do that, I know.

19
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:44,725
Well, if I had the genetic material.

20
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:48,724
- Take it from Shockeye.
- Shockeye?

21
00:05:48,887 --> 00:05:51,355
I want you to make a consort for me.

22
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:53,836
Leave him the power of time travel.

23
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:56,567
Leave the symbiotic nuclei within him,

24
00:05:56,727 --> 00:06:02,120
but turn him into an Androgum by blood
and by instinct. How long would that take?

25
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:07,202
Not long. Two simple operations.
The first to implant the genetic material,

26
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,962
and then a second operation
to stabilise his condition.

27
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:14,722
(CHESSENE) Good.
Then that is what we shall do.

28
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,446
(CHESSENE) Shockeye!

29
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:38,880
Help Dastari get the Doctor
back to the operating theatre.

30
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:41,925
Let me trim the beast first. It won't take long.

31
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:46,478
Later, Shockeye.
Dastari wants to operate immediately.

32
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:50,761
If you say so!

33
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,584
- Peri, can you stand?
- Oh, my head!

34
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:13,817
- What happened?
- Can you stand?

35
00:07:13,987 --> 00:07:16,263
- Yes, I think so.
- Come on. Let's get out of here!

36
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:20,019
What will you do when Stike discovers
the plan's been changed?

37
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:25,064
I have no further use for Stike.
He and his underling must be destroyed.

38
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:39,977
- They've still got the Doctor!
- And they're turning him into an Androgum!

39
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:43,617
- How long will it take?
- Dastari said two operations.

1
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:48,716
I've given the Time Lord
a 50 per cent Androgum inheritance.

2
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:52,800
Within an hour, that will become
the dominant genetic factor.

3
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:57,802
- I can then stabilise his cell structure.
- We must deal with the Sontarans.

4
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:00,401
- How?
- Coronic acid kills them.

5
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,364
We have no coronic acid.

6
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:07,317
I had three canisters prepared
before we left the station, just in case.

7
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:02,324
At last! Action, I think.

8
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:07,320
Stike! Varl! This way.

9
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:24,121
- (STIKE) What is it, Dastari?
- The Time Lord has returned.

10
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:27,836
He's in the passage.
Chessene's waiting in the cellar.

11
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:30,567
If you go in this way, we have him trapped.

12
00:10:56,607 --> 00:11:00,725
- Capercaillies in brandy sauce!
- What?

13
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:07,599
With a stuffing of black pudding
made of live pig's blood, herbs and pepper!

14
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:13,285
And the breast of the bird
should be slit and studded with truffles!

15
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:16,837
- You know the cuisine of this planet?
- Of course I do.

16
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:20,841
I have eaten pressed duck at the Tour d'Argent.

17
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:26,320
They are fed only on corn, fruit pulp
and molasses. They are exquisite, Shockeye!

18
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:29,524
Why am I thinking of food?

19
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:33,680
Because you are now an Androgum!

20
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:38,637
Can you lead me to one of these eating places
to sample the local dishes?

21
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:42,038
Of course I can,
but you will need proper clothes.

22
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,199
A collar, a neck-tie at least.

23
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:49,118
I know where there are clothes!

24
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:52,357
- Looks like Chessene's won!
- Yeah.

25
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:54,518
Doctor!

26
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:00,841
Quail p�t�, I think, Shockeye!

27
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,886
Followed by a bisque de crevettes!

28
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:15,485
- Now where are they going?
- They look quite pally!

29
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:21,005
- Where have they gone?
- They're hunting food.

30
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:25,638
- If the Doctor isn't stabilised...
- He'll reject the transfusion.

31
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:29,720
- We must find them!
- Wait! On Earth, there is little hunting.

32
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,436
The Do�a Arana remembers
many restaurants in Seville.

33
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,167
That is where they shall be. Come!

34
00:14:57,807 --> 00:15:01,846
(SHOCKEYE) Tell me, on this planet,
do they ever eat their own?

35
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:05,044
I believe in the far Indies, it has been known,

36
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:07,960
but I remember a dish, shepherd's pie...

37
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:11,915
Shepherd's pie? A shepherd!
Can't we walk quicker?

38
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:17,556
(SNIFFS)

39
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:21,081
Do you serve humans here?

40
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,238
Most of the time, sir.

41
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:29,482
Yes, I think I could venture to say that most
of our customers are certainly human!

42
00:21:29,647 --> 00:21:33,083
I mean human meat, you fawning imbecile!

43
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:38,241
No, sir. The nouvelle cuisine
has not yet penetrated this establishment.

44
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:20,646
- Was everything to your satisfaction?
- Tolerable.

45
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:25,722
It's been a pleasure to see such dedicated
trenchermen enjoying their food.

46
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:30,438
Unfortunately, the reckoning is rather high!

47
00:24:33,287 --> 00:24:37,803
- What is this?
- It's the amount you owe, sir.

48
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:42,802
- Do you understand this?
- He's asking for money.

49
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,878
Money?

50
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:47,845
Tokens of exchange.

51
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:52,397
- This is our tally?
- Yes, sir.

52
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:59,284
- Here.
- Keep the change.

53
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:04,157
I'm sorry, sir. I can see
you're a wit as well as a bon vivant,

54
00:25:04,327 --> 00:25:07,603
but this, whatever it is, is not acceptable.

55
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:10,955
That is a 20-narg note!

56
00:25:11,127 --> 00:25:15,837
- It's valid anywhere in the nine planets!
- It's not acceptable here.

57
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:49,966
Gentlemen, if this is a joke,
it has gone on long enough.

58
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:53,085
We can accept any recognised credit card.

59
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,965
I will pay you with this!

60
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:04,397
Your whining importunacy
has acidised my digestive juices!

61
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:06,762
Agh!

62
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:48,119
- Can you walk?
- Walk?

63
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:50,960
Of course I can walk!

64
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,118
Right. Come on.

65
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:59,279
I am a police officer. Come along with me, sir!

66
00:27:59,447 --> 00:28:02,280
What is this? Who do I think you are?

67
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:05,516
We'd better go.

68
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:19,880
- Now, you come along with me, sir!
- How dare you?! Let go of me!

69
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:22,436
- This way!
- No, this way!

70
00:28:22,607 --> 00:28:28,682
- Now, look. You got me into this mess!
- Will you please stop squabbling?

71
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,075
We'll go this way.

72
00:28:35,687 --> 00:28:37,245
(CHESSENE) No!

73
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:43,716
You'll come this way! We have
some unfinished business to attend to.
