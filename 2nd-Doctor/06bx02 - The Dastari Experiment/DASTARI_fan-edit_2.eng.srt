00:00:02,847 --> 00:00:06,317
(''DOCTOR WHO'' THEME)

2
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:44,518
Doctor!

3
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,697
Whoa, there. Steady now...

4
00:00:57,367 --> 00:01:01,963
Quiet, boy. Easy! Shockeye will not hurt you!

5
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:07,236
Ooh, we are wild, aren't we?

6
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:10,558
(CHESSENE) Shockeye!
Why aren't you on the ship?

7
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:13,400
I was just collecting provisions, madam.

8
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:16,001
(CHESSENE) The ship is fully stocked.

9
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:18,476
The standard rations are so boring.

10
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:22,003
These are a few special things for the journey.

11
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:25,125
A cold collation I prepared.

12
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:32,399
- The Tellurian has escaped!
- Stike will leave nothing alive here.

13
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:36,321
- But such a waste, madam.
- We must go. Bring the hamper.

14
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:38,876
Have you decided on our destination?

15
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:41,242
It's unimportant.

16
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:44,001
- Earth?
- If you wish.

17
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:45,680
But why Earth?

18
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:49,442
I have a desire to taste
one of these human beasts, madam.

19
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:53,441
The meat looks so white
and roundsomely layered on the bone -

20
00:01:53,607 --> 00:01:57,043
a sure sign of a tasty animal.

21
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:18,084
Excellent.

22
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:24,362
I detect only one occupant. A female.

23
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:29,840
Don't use the gas injector, madam.
They give the flesh an acrid taste.

24
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:31,838
I'll slaughter it myself.

25
00:03:00,787 --> 00:03:03,426
Where is Varl?

26
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:09,139
He's setting up a homing beacon
for the Sontaran ship.

27
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:16,064
We must ask Stike to make a discreet landing.
This planet is greatly over-populated.

28
00:03:17,227 --> 00:03:21,743
By the time I leave it, madam,
that may not be a problem!

29
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:28,721
Did you learn much from the dead mind?

30
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:35,197
It was a puny thing.

31
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:40,485
This region of the planet is called Andalucia.

32
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:44,276
We are four kilometres from the city of Seville.

33
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:47,961
And is the eating good there?

34
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:52,683
Doï¿½a Arana had little interest in food.

35
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:56,237
- Her mind was full of her religion.
- Religion?

36
00:03:56,407 --> 00:04:01,401
I am not interested in the beliefs of primitives,
only in what they taste like!

1
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:10,566
- Good morning.
- Don't try to move yet, Doctor.

2
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:14,561
- Dastari.
- You'll feel dizzy for a time.

3
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:18,879
So, I've been drugged, have I?

4
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:21,238
What did you use?

5
00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:25,866
It feels like one of the anomode group.

6
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:29,637
Absolutely right. Siralanomode.

7
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:32,441
Siralanomode? That affects the memory.

8
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:35,121
We're not interested in your memory.

9
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:38,076
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

10
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:42,365
Oh, the augmented Androgum.

11
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:47,984
I don't think much
of the company you keep, Dastari!

12
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:54,121
Sontarans! I remember now. The Space Station.

13
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:58,485
But I had someone with me... Jamie!

14
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:03,281
- What have you done with Jamie?
- You companion will be long since dead.

15
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:06,917
- The Sontarans take no prisoners.
- Inflexible policy.

16
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:09,396
- No!
- Fasten the restraints!

17
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,558
Oh, Jamie! No!

18
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:17,219
(THE DOCTOR GROANS)

19
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:20,126
Poor old Jamie!

20
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:25,317
What have you got there, Shockeye?

21
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:30,277
A selection of recipes, madam,
used by these humans. It's most interesting.

22
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:35,919
I cannot think that Shockeye o' the Quancing
Grig has anything to learn from humans.

23
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,555
- Do you understand it?
- Yes, indeed.

24
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:42,003
These are Chinese and these are Spanish.

25
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:47,165
The ingredients are unfamiliar, naturally,

26
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:51,923
but the general principles
are similar to our own methods.

27
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:57,002
They cannot be quite as primitive as I believed.
In many ways, they resemble us.

28
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,635
In what ways?

29
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:02,605
Well, I've found many of these books here.

30
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:10,162
Now, there cannot be a creature on the planet
that humans do not kill and eat.

31
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:14,443
Many beasts are bred especially for table.

32
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,883
They are force-fed to improve the flesh,

33
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:23,485
and penned in small confined quarters
to fatten more rapidly.

34
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:25,877
It's fascinating!

35
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:41,499
- What have you got there?
- The Kartz-Reimer transference module.

36
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:43,098
That'll never work!
I can tell that from here.

37
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:46,559
It worked well enough to bring you to the Space Station.

38
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:49,639
All it did was to produce a few hiccups in the time continuum.

39
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:52,560
Enough to tell us that dangerously crude experiments were going on.

40
00:06:52,727 --> 00:06:57,721
Kartz and Reimer were clearly on the right track.
Several Androgums successfully vanished into time.

41
00:06:57,887 --> 00:07:01,084
During those experiments, unfortunately, 
we were unable to bring them back.

42
00:07:01,247 --> 00:07:06,605
Of course not. No one can travel through time
without a molecular stabilisation system.

43
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:12,000
We know that now, and that Time Lords possess
a symbiotic link with their machines.

44
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:16,036
which protects them, and anyone with them, against destabilisation.

45
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:19,801
- Guesswork!
- Don't underestimate Chessene, Doctor.

46
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:24,499
Hers was the brain behind Kartz and Reimer.

47
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:30,219
And it was she who first realised that the
missing element had to lie somewhere in here.

48
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:33,777
So what are you going to do?
Cut me up piece by piece?

49
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:39,226
Let us say cell by cell and gene by gene
until I isolate the symbiotic nuclei.

50
00:07:39,387 --> 00:07:41,617
When did you go mad, Dastari?

51
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:44,585
(LAUGHS) I assure you I'm not at all mad.

52
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:48,057
Then you're totally
under Chessene's domination!

53
00:07:48,227 --> 00:07:53,176
Are you hoping to give her the power
of time travel? Is that the idea?

54
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,941
I shall put her among the gods.

55
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:58,780
There need be no limit to her achievement!

56
00:07:58,947 --> 00:08:02,462
There'll be no limit to her capacity for evil!

57
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:05,298
She's an Androgum, Dastari, whatever you may say! 

58
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,850
She'll snap off the hand that feeds her whenever she feels hungry!

59
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:11,456
You don't know Chessene.

60
00:08:13,387 --> 00:08:18,541
I confess I was sad that the Time Lords
chose to send you as their emissary

61
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:24,339
because I've always had a certain
regard for you, Doctor, personally,

62
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:28,182
and the operation will,
of necessity, be painful, but...

63
00:08:28,347 --> 00:08:31,879
- It'll hurt you more than it hurts me (!)
- What gives you that idea?

64
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:34,862
No, I was going to say but at least
you'll have the satisfaction of  knowing...

65
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:39,800
- you were part of a great undertaking.
- You're an irresponsible old fool!

66
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:44,245
The Androgums are barbarians!
Release them into time

67
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:49,322
and every civilised people in the galaxy
will curse your name! Do you hear me?!

68
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:53,082
Oh, my giddy aunt! Oh, crumbs!

69
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:03,601
I heard something out there.

70
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:06,520
I heard nothing.

71
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:10,282
You were too busy talking
about your favourite subject.

72
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:12,438
I must taste a Tellurian soon.

73
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:17,158
A young one with a good proportion
of meat to the bone.

74
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:19,716
I am becoming insane for such a feast.

75
00:09:19,887 --> 00:09:24,677
Be patient, Shockeye.
We'll find one for you before we leave Earth.

76
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:30,763
Indeed, I'll join you at table,
for I confess to a certain curiosity myself.

77
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:36,445
I'm afraid I'm unable to give you a full anaesthetic.

78
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:39,985
- Doing the job on the cheap, eh?
- You have to be conscious

79
00:09:40,107 --> 00:09:43,681
while the neuron bombardment excites the brain cells.
I will then be able to examine them.

80
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:46,537
You should be examining your own brain cells, Dastari

81
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:50,240
Most of them must have leaked out your ears,
or you wouldn't be involved in this madness.

82
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:53,356
This injection will simply inhibit
the motor centres.

83
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:57,176
Get on with it, Dastari!
You're delaying my war effort!

84
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:04,276
If you want this operation
to succeed, Group Marshal,

85
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:09,441
you will allow me to proceed as I decide
and at the pace I consider appropriate!

86
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:13,797
- Count backwards from ten, Doctor.
- Certainly not!

87
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:16,959
Do you expect me to co-operate
in my own murder?

88
00:10:17,127 --> 00:10:21,279
I'm dongay...ollik...parl...

89
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:32,799
(BLEEPING)

90
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:48,419
The next step
is partially to detach the occipital bone.

91
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:52,480
(WHIRRING)
