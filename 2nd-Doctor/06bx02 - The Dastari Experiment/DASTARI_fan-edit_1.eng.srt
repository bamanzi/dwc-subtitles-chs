(''DOCTOR WHO'' THEME)

2
00:00:30,267 --> 00:00:32,258
Come here, Jamie.

3
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:35,498
Look at that.

4
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:43,818
(JAMIE) Look at the size of that thing, Doctor!

5
00:00:43,987 --> 00:00:47,024
Yes, Jamie. That is a big one.

6
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:49,178
Just a wee laboratory, eh (?)

7
00:00:49,347 --> 00:00:53,181
Well... Obviously, it's grown.

8
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:58,375
It's like 20 castles in the sky!
Are you sure this is the right place?

9
00:00:58,547 --> 00:01:01,937
- Of course I am!
- We never get to where you say we will.

10
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:06,658
I got Victoria to where she wanted to go.
Why does she want to learn graphology?

11
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:08,863
Will we ever get back to her?

12
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,825
- Of course!
- I'll believe that when I see it!

13
00:01:11,987 --> 00:01:17,061
At the moment, we have other things
to worry about. Look at this!

14
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:20,617
- I've not seen that before.
- It's not been here before.

15
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:22,778
It's a teleport control.

16
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:25,620
You'd think I'd never flown a Tardis solo!

17
00:01:25,787 --> 00:01:30,019
- What does it do?
- It gives the Time Lords dual control.

18
00:01:30,187 --> 00:01:32,701
I shall complain when this is over!

19
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:40,697
I think we'll dematerialise to avoid
their detection beams and slip in quietly.

20
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:44,701
- You said they were friendly.
- Probably overwhelmingly so.

21
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:47,222
Then why do we have to slip in quietly?

22
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:52,381
The most brilliant scientists in the universe
have assembled here to do research.

23
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:54,981
I don't want them to know I've arrived.

24
00:01:55,147 --> 00:01:59,026
- Why not?
- They'll all want my autograph.

25
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:03,146
I just want a quiet word
with Dastari, Head of Projects.

26
00:02:04,987 --> 00:02:06,978
Right, then.

27
00:02:12,027 --> 00:02:14,018
(BOOMING)

28
00:02:14,187 --> 00:02:17,384
Splendid! We've hit conterminous time again.

29
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:20,380
- We've certainly hit something (!)
- Jamie!

30
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:23,220
Right.

31
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:25,582
Follow me.

32
00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:29,778
- Wait!
- What?

33
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:32,541
We'd better take the recall disk.

34
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:37,542
- Don't wander off. Stay with me.
- Do I ever?

35
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:41,700
It has been known. And let me do the talking.

36
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:44,097
Just stand in the background...

37
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:47,464
..''And admire your diplomatic skills'' (!)

38
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:57,461
How dare you?!

39
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:01,017
How dare you transmat that object
into my kitchens?!

40
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:04,941
How dare you have the impertinence
to address me like that?

41
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:10,176
I am Shockeye o' the Quancing Grig!

42
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:15,137
I'm not interested in the pedigree
of an Androgum. I am a Time Lord!

43
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:22,504
Oh... My humblest apologies!

44
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,897
I should have realised.

45
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,902
But this one with you?

46
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,422
He is from the planet Earth. A human.

47
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:35,578
A Tellurian!

48
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:38,215
I have not seen one of these before!

49
00:03:38,387 --> 00:03:40,696
Is it a gift for Dastari?

50
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:42,220
A gift?!

51
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:48,144
Such a soft white skin,
whispering of a tender succulence!

52
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:51,140
Dastari will not appreciate its qualities.

53
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:54,617
He has no sensual refinement.

54
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:57,345
Let me buy it from you.

55
00:03:57,507 --> 00:03:59,498
My companion is not for sale!

56
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:04,582
No chef in the nine planets would do more
to bring out the flavour of the beast!

57
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:07,136
You get on with your butchery!

58
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:10,382
Come along, Jamie.

59
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:20,578
Ooh...

60
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:23,545
I can just taste that flesh!

61
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,827
(RUNNING FOOTSTEPS)

62
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:33,266
Who was that?

63
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:36,658
Shockeye o' the Quancing Grig.
He's an Androgum.

64
00:04:36,827 --> 00:04:39,261
The Androgums are the servitors here.

65
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:43,022
- They do the station maintenance.
- You mean a scullion?

66
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:46,782
Yes, with a high opinion of himself.
Chefs usually have!

67
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:49,666
- (WHOOSHING)
- It's the Tardis!

68
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:55,506
Our allies won't care for that!

69
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:59,580
I said the Group Marshal
could have the Time Lord's machine.

70
00:04:59,747 --> 00:05:04,696
- Will it make any difference?
- Not to me. I have the Kartz-Reimer module.

71
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:09,463
It shows the Gallifreyans are suspicious.
I was right to lay the plans I did.

72
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:12,539
- So now we wait.
- Not for long.

73
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:14,504
Stike is moving.

74
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:18,899
Already? The calgesic won't have
affected the scientists yet.

75
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:22,184
It will by the time Stike's forces arrive.

76
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:27,423
Did they enjoy the meal?

77
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:33,586
Dastari said you had surpassed yourself!

78
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:35,738
Oh!

79
00:05:35,907 --> 00:05:40,617
Being unable to taste it, I worried
that it might be over-seasoned!

80
00:05:42,747 --> 00:05:47,980
Shockeye, their last supper would have added
lustre to your reputation...

81
00:05:49,787 --> 00:05:53,097
..except that they won't live to remember it!

82
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,655
I remember it very clearly, Doctor.

83
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:04,945
You came to our inauguration,
bearing fraternal greetings from Gallifrey.

84
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:10,784
Yes, that was before I fell from favour.
I'm a bit of an exile these days.

85
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:12,938
Yes, I heard about that.

86
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,701
But you still act on their instructions?

87
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:18,097
It's the price I pay for my freedom.

88
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,701
We've had no support from your people.

89
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:25,861
You can't expect help from the Time Lords.
Their policy is one of strict neutrality.

90
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:30,498
Nonetheless, they have disappointed
the other Third Zone governments.

91
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:33,818
Don't chide me. I'm simply a messenger.

92
00:06:33,987 --> 00:06:38,697
- Officially, I'm here unofficially.
- You'll explain that paradox, I know.

93
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:44,863
I'm a pariah, exiled from Time Lord society.
They can always deny sending me.

94
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:48,018
Then why have they sent you?

95
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:52,100
They have been monitoring
the experiments in time travel

96
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:54,781
of the Professors Kartz and Reimer.

97
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:57,665
They want them stopped.

98
00:06:58,827 --> 00:07:05,141
I see. How do the Time Lords equate that
with a policy of strict neutrality?

99
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:06,820
They don't have to.

100
00:07:06,987 --> 00:07:10,662
I have no official existence,
so they can deny sending me.

101
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:13,022
(LAUGHS)

102
00:07:13,187 --> 00:07:15,178
Typical!

103
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:18,338
Typical hypocrisy!

104
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:22,420
- Yes, Chessene?
- Do your guests require refreshment?

105
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:26,136
- Ah, well...
- No, thank you. We've already eaten.

106
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:27,626
That was yesterday!

107
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:32,781
- One meal a day is sufficient.
- You're sure? Thank you, Chessene.

108
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:34,938
Very good, Professor.

109
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:41,665
Well, Doctor,
what do you make of our chatelaine?

110
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:44,946
Was she an Androgum?

111
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:49,862
She was. Now she's an Androgum TA.
Technologically augmented.

112
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:53,224
Oh, one of your biological experiments!

113
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:56,538
I've carried out
nine augmentations on Chessene.

114
00:07:56,707 --> 00:08:00,063
She's at mega genius level now.
I'm very proud of her.

115
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:03,822
- Proud of her or your own skill?
- Perhaps a little of both.

116
00:08:03,987 --> 00:08:07,457
All that Androgum energy
now functions on a higher plane.

117
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:11,097
She spends days in the data banks
sucking in knowledge.

118
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:15,897
- You can't change nature.
- In Chessene's case, I believe I have.

119
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:18,706
Give a monkey control of its environment

120
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:21,461
and it will fill the world with bananas!

121
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,619
I expected something
more progressive from you.

122
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:29,019
- My work has tremendous implications.
- That's why it's dangerous!

123
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:34,181
Doctor, our races have become tired
and effete. Our seed is thin.

124
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,180
We must hand the baton of progress to others.

125
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:41,420
If I can raise the Androgums
to a higher plane of consciousness,

126
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:46,058
there's no limit to what that
boiling energy might achieve!

127
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:51,221
You could augment an earwig to the point
where it understood nuclear physics.

128
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:54,982
It would still be a very stupid thing to do.

129
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:05,745
Identify!

130
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:10,541

<i>are Sontaran battle cruisers.</i>

131
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:12,698
<i>Their intention is hostile.</i>

132
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:15,017
(MAN) Operate the defence!

133
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:28,216
<i>(COMPUTER) Please complete</i>
<i>your last instructions.</i>

134
00:09:28,387 --> 00:09:32,778
The last instruction is cancelled.
Maintain normal surveillance.

135
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,063
<i>Normal surveillance.</i>

136
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:38,182
Open all docking bays.

137
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:45,966
Even if I wanted to, I have no authority to order
Kartz and Reimer to abandon their work.

138
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,119
You have. You sanction every experiment here.

139
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:52,802
What reason do I give?
That the Time Lords are concerned?

140
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:57,438
Our monitors have detected ripples
of up to point four on the Bocca scale.

141
00:09:57,607 --> 00:10:01,725
Anything much higher would threaten
the whole fabric of time.

142
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:06,563
They are well aware of the dangers.
They are responsible scientists.

143
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:08,797
They're incompetent meddlers!

144
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:13,483
Aren't you being a little ingenuous?
The Time Lords have a vested interest

145
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:16,923
in ensuring that others
do not discover their secrets.

146
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:19,203
I'm sure that's not the case.

147
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:22,200
Your own machine is no longer in the station.

148
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:25,120
You didn't want Kartz and Reimer to look at it.

149
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:28,926
Look, I've a suggestion.

150
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:33,160
Stop these experiments
while my people study their work.

151
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:37,684
If Kartz and Reimer are on safe lines,
they'll be allowed to continue.

152
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,599
''Allowed to continue''?

153
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:45,476
I mean there would be no further objection.

154
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:47,126
In the first place,

155
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:52,805
I have no authority to ask Kartz and Reimer
to submit their work for analysis!

156
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:54,366
In the second place,

157
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:58,520
the Time Lords have no right
to make this grossly unethical demand.

158
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,919
- That's unmitigated arrogance!
- And that's specious claptrap!

159
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:05,078
Don't prate to me about ethics!

160
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:11,322
The balance of the space-time continuum could
be destroyed by your ham-fisted numbskulls!

161
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:17,926
I don't feel there's anything to be gained
by prolonging this discussion, Doctor.

162
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:24,526
You have more letters after your name than
anyone I know - enough for two alphabets.

163
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:30,478
How can you be such a stupid, stubborn,
irrational, objectionable old idiot?

164
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:34,322
What are you smiling at,
you hairy-legged Highlander?

165
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:37,957
I'm just admiring your diplomatic skills!

166
00:11:38,127 --> 00:11:39,480
Dastari?

167
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,605
He's got his head doon,
and I can't say I blame him.

168
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,362
- He's drugged!
- He's what?

169
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:47,518
