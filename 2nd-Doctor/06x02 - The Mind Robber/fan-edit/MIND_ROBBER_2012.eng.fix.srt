00:12:53,716 --> 00:12:56,944
- It's a brick wall with a door painted on it.
- That's crazy!

175
00:12:57,056 --> 00:12:59,865
- How do you open a door that isn't a door?
- Let me think.

176
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:02,955
What's the good of thinking?
What we want is a battering ram.

177
00:13:03,055 --> 00:13:04,723
maybe if we could cut down
one of those trees

178
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:08,748
- When is a door not a door?
- This is no time for riddles.

When is a door not a door, hmm?

180
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:14,270

Go on. Get her out.

Come on, then. Up you come.

One, two, three...

00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:41,384
I thought I was never going to get out of...
Who are you?

00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:45,076
Eh? Och, don't you start, Zoe.
I've had enough from the Doctor.

192
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:48,428
I tell you I'm me. Jamie!

193
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:53,872
- Why does he look so different?
- Well, I'll... I'll tell you later.

194
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:58,587
- I think it's about time we got out of this wood.
- Aye. This place gives me the creeps.

195
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:01,395
You go on ahead, Jamie.

196
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:06,151
- Is that really Jamie?
- Well... Well, yes.

197
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:09,911
He couldn't just have changed like that.
I mean it's impossible.

198
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:15,070
I think we may be in a place
where nothing is impossible. Come on.

There's no sign of the toy soldiers now.

202
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:34,660
- We've got to get out of this place.
- Look.

203
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:36,944
There's a house.

204

Creag an tuire!

205
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:43,698
Jamie!

206
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:47,622
- Doctor!  - It's all right, Zoe.

207
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:53,022
Well, come on. If you want to play games,
let's get on with it.

I have to make up his face again.

00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:02,498
- You did this before!  - Yes.

212
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,943
That's how Jamie's face got changed.

213
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:07,906
- You got it all wrong!
- What? No, no.

214
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:09,899
Well, I was rushed.

All right, I know!

There we are.

- I have?  - Yes. Look.

00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:46,828
You're right, I have! That's much better.

00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:51,061

- We could easily get lost in there.
- Just a moment.

233
00:16:25,428 --> 00:16:27,419
What's he found?

234
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:29,579
A ball of twine.

235
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:34,458
Hmm... Oh, yes...
This must have been an invitation.

236
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,619
Why?

00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:41,862
It's the classical way of getting through a maze.
Tie that to the door, will you?

00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:44,781
Hey! It's locked.

239
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:49,257
- Then we ARE meant to go on.
- Yes, I think we are.

240
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:53,121
But that means that wherever we go,
at any time, they know.

241
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:54,821
They're expecting us.

242
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:58,617
Yes... Don't break the thread. Come along.

243
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:05,983
- Which way, do you think?   - To the right.

244

(DOCTOR) They both look equally
unattractive to me.

245
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:13,020
It must be to the right.
I've been working it out as we went along.

00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:14,985
- Doctor...  - Shh! How?

247
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:18,246
As soon as we avoided the dead ends,
it soon fell into a clear pattern.

248
00:17:18,308 --> 00:17:23,660
One left, two right, three left, four right
and so on. A simple arithmetical progression.

- Yes. But Doctor...  - Shh!

00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:28,823
What it is to have an arithmetical brain!
What do you want?

252
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:37,580
No. You stay here
and Zoe and I will explore a little further.

253
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:41,661
There must be another way out of this maze.
I need to find it.

They don't want us to find a way out,
only a way in!

I was right. This isn't the way out.

We're in the middle of the maze.

committee, but perhaps I was wrong.

I hope you were!

Half-man, half-bull, yes.

268
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:48,907
And he lived in the heart of a labyrinth.

And there were human sacrifices!

(MASTER) No! Brainless idiot.

Get yourself free. Don't let the boy escape!

I think this is the place.

00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,011
Yes. There's no sign of him.

290
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:51,086
I'm sure he wouldn't have gone off without...

291
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:53,318
- What's that?  - His jacket.

292
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:57,720
- Well, he must be around here somewhere.
- Jamie!

Who's that?

- My dear sir!  - Your servant, sir.

00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:06,038
- You have a knack of turning up unexpectedly.
- Have you seen Jamie?

296
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:09,623
I walked alone
but saw no sign of any inhabitants.

297
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:13,950
- (ZOE) Are you absolutely positive?
- I would not impose any falsities upon you.

298
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:16,662
- I adhere strictly to truth.
- Of course.

- The Master? Yes?

Have you seen him?

302
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:29,878
Upon occasion he has been pleased
to grant me an audience.

Where might I find him?

304
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:35,919
The Master's palace is no ordinary edifice,
but a citadel,

a walled town at the top of a hill or cliff,
the highest in the kingdom.

Now I think I understand.

307
00:21:42,908 --> 00:21:47,738
May I ask, sir, where you come from?
Would it not be Nottingham?

308
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:52,698
My father had a small estate in Nottingham.
I was the third of five sons.

309
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:56,224
He sent me to Emmanuel College
in Cambridge at 14 years old,

310
00:21:56,388 --> 00:22:00,745
where I applied myself close to my studies,
learning navigation and other parts mathematics...

as I always believed
it would be my fortune to do.

00:22:07,348 --> 00:22:09,020
Now I know who you are, sir.

00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:12,498
- Your name is Lemuel Gulliver!
- Your servant, sir.

- Gulliver?  - Yes.

00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,466
Oh, no!

317
00:22:24,788 --> 00:22:28,383
I'd need to be a human fly to get up that lot.

318
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:32,097
I can't go back, though.
What I really need is a...

Who says wishes don't come true?

00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:53,740
Ouch!

321
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:56,820
I suppose you know that hurts?

322
00:22:56,956 --> 00:22:59,928
- You mean this is your hair?  - Of course

323
00:22:59,988 --> 00:23:03,662
I don't object to people climbing it -
I'm quite used to it, actually -

324
00:23:03,728 --> 00:23:06,981
- but you would keep tugging so.
- I'm sorry.

325
00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:08,979
- Are you a prince?  - No. Why?

326
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:13,380
You're supposed to be.
I'm a princess, but I suppose you knew that.

327
00:23:13,548 --> 00:23:17,700
My name's Rapunzel. You're not
a woodcutter's son, by any chance?

328
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:21,224
- No. I'm the son of a piper.
- How very disappointing.

329
00:23:21,388 --> 00:23:23,026
In that case, I think you'd better go. Goodbye.

330
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:24,780
- Your Highness, wait!  - Well?

331
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:28,950
I can't go back there. It's a sheer drop.
And I can't just stand out here.

332
00:23:29,052 --> 00:23:30,545
I'll have to climb in through the window.

333
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:34,343
- I don't know if that would be allowed.
- I won't stay long.

334
00:23:34,508 --> 00:23:36,897
Just passing through, you might say.

335
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:41,698
- Och, please.
- It's a great pity you're not a prince.

336
00:23:41,868 --> 00:23:44,018
You'd have made rather a good one.

337
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:46,861
Well, I suppose you'd better come inside.

Rapunzel!

340
00:23:58,748 --> 00:24:01,057
Your Highness, where have you gone?

341
00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:03,867
Don't be silly. I'm not going...

342
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:09,261
Hey, this doesn't look like
the inside of a princess's castle to me.

343
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:17,382
...but it would not be proper to trouble you
with the particulars of my adventures.

344
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:19,698
I wouldn't dream of detaining you.

345
00:24:19,868 --> 00:24:22,985
Having been condemned, by Nature and Fortune
to a restless and active life,

346
00:24:23,148 --> 00:24:25,537
I must take my leave of you. Farewell.

347
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,858
Farewell.

348
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:30,940
Why does he talk
in such an extraordinary way?

349
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:34,578
He can only speak the words
that Dean Swift gave him to say.

350
00:24:34,748 --> 00:24:37,820
That's ridiculous. I mean there never
was such a person as Gulliver.

351
00:24:37,988 --> 00:24:40,980
- He's a fictional character.
- Of course he is. Don't you understand.

352
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:45,505
This world that we've tumbled into
is a world of fiction -

''The Doctor and Zoe,

354
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:59,617

- Yes.

- We have to say Medusa does not exist.
- But she does!

369
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:55,324
Zoe, Medusa is a myth.

370
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:59,006
If you believe in her,
she can turn us both to stone.

- That's it! You're meant to use it like Perseus.

- Maybe it's another trap.
- Doctor, please!

377
00:26:24,487 --> 00:26:28,400
No. How can I kill something
that doesn't exist?

378
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:32,003

There. Look at her reflection in the mirror. Look!

- Can you see her?  - Yes.

382
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:48,606
This is how Perseus escaped.
He looked at her reflection in his polished shield.

383

there were no such persons here.

Yes. I got in all right, but how do I get out?

I was of the opinion that...

Go on, go on.

410
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:17,982

given by some person in authority.

Now I'm getting somewhere.

Listen. If there aren't any robots,
who do you think was carrying out those orders?

- Who's the Yahoos?

A cursed race of inferior creatures.
I never beheld so disagreeable an animal.

There's an electrical gadget around here
somewhere that sets off an alarm gong.

I walked through it, the gong went off
and they sent robots after me.

- Robots? You mean the same ones we saw before?
- Big white ones.

- Doctor, did you hear that?
- Yes. I thought they'd turn up sooner or later.

- I'm not leaving yet. I'm here on business.

I think you should not be here.

The Master makes rules for his kingdom.
It is unwise for you to disobey.

477
00:33:54,887 --> 00:33:56,798
So you think we shouldn't see the Master?

- No. Of course not. I said I'd think it over.

00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:58,005
When somebody writes about an incident

that's fiction.

we would have become fiction.

00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:27,318
- What are we going to do?
- I mean that's funny. Gulliver walked through there.

501
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:31,878
- Gulliver is not real. We are.
- They're coming! Where can we hide?

502
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,750
- No need to hide.
- Why not? If they find us...

503
00:35:34,847 --> 00:35:37,038
- Let them find us.
- You mean just stand here and wait?

504
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:40,563
Yes. Why not? We'll ask for
an interview with the Master.

505
00:35:40,727 --> 00:35:43,560
- They may not give us time to ask...
- Look!

506
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:47,686
- (BUZZING AND BEEPING)
- Are you looking for us, by any chance?

507
00:35:55,247 --> 00:35:59,001
We... We demand an interview
with the Master!

508
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:11,243
(MAN) Ho, ho!
How very fortunate. Do come in, Doctor.

509
00:36:11,407 --> 00:36:14,524
I've been expecting you.

510
00:36:14,687 --> 00:36:19,602
Oh, don't be alarmed.
Won't you walk into my parlour?

511
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:23,282
Said the spider to the fly.

512
00:36:25,927 --> 00:36:28,043
Come along.

(LOW HUMMING)

514
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:41,642
- It's hard to see anything.
- Where are you?

515
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:47,000
Here! Patiently waiting.

516
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:57,802
Oh! Oh, Doctor. This is a great pleasure.

517
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:00,780
And your two young companions.
Now let me see...

518
00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:04,880
Oh, yes, yes. Zoe and Jamie.
I have your dossiers here in front of me.

519
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:07,845
- You appear to be well organised.
- Yes. Indeed. We have to be.

520
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:11,966
Running this place
requires enormous attention to detail.

521
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:17,440
- It's a responsible position, but very rewarding.
- Responsible, eh?

522
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:21,680
- To someone else?
- Not to someone. Another power.

523
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:24,884
Higher than any you could begin to imagine.

524
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:28,323
Oh, I must congratulate you
on the great skill

525
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:31,365
in which you tackled
in various stages of your examination.

526
00:37:31,527 --> 00:37:34,439
What is the purpose of all these tests?

527
00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:39,761
You know, when I was first brought here myself,
I was as bewildered as you are.

528
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:44,762
- How long have you been here?
- I left England in the summer of 1926.

529
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:49,077
It was a very hot day, I remember.

530
00:37:50,087 --> 00:37:54,797
I think I must have dozed off over my desk,
and when I awoke...

531
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,317
But that's a long story.

532
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:03,003
Did you ever hear of the adventures
of Captain Jack Harkaway?

533
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:06,637
No, I can't say that I... Wait a minute.

534
00:38:06,807 --> 00:38:10,880
- A serial in a boys' magazine?
- The ''Ensign''.

535
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:15,359
And for 25 years,
I delivered 5,000 words every week.

536
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,518
You're a writer.

537
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:20,645
25 years, 5,000 words a week?

538
00:38:20,807 --> 00:38:25,517
- That's over half a million words.
- Yes. It was probably a record.

539
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:27,996
That's why I was selected to work here.

540
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:32,046
- You're the one that is in charge of all this?
- In one sense, yes.

541
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:35,597
Yes. Or is all this in charge of you?

542
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:42,926
My brain is the source of the creative power
which keeps this whole operation going.

543
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:47,763
I see. That means
that you are virtually a prisoner.

544
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:49,519
No, no.

545
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:52,599
(HUMMING)

546
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:03,162
You... You must excuse me for one moment.

547
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:10,959
- Let's get out of here.
- Yes. It gives me the creeps.

548
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:12,482
No. I need to find out more.

549
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:16,082
You keep him talking.
Zoe and me will find another way out.

550
00:39:16,247 --> 00:39:18,477
No, Jamie. I think we'd be safer
if we all stick together.

551
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:24,040
- (HUMMING STOPS)
- Sorry to have kept you waiting. Where were we?

552
00:39:24,207 --> 00:39:28,325
You were about to answer my question.
Are you a prisoner here?

553
00:39:28,487 --> 00:39:31,081
No. No, I wouldn't say that.

554
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:36,401
In fact, I rather like being here.
I have everything I could possibly want.

555
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:40,685
This vast library
with all the known works of fiction.

556
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:44,556
All the masterpieces written by Earthmen
since the beginning of time.

557
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:54,600
- I don't think he noticed.
- No. Let's try down there.

558
00:39:54,767 --> 00:40:01,684
I see, yes. And only an Earthman-type creature
has the power to create fiction.

559
00:40:01,847 --> 00:40:04,600
- The power to imagine.
- Exactly.

560
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:09,238
This is one field in which
the intelligence I serve cannot compete.

561
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:15,039
They need a man of boundless imagination
as a...um...

562
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:18,165
a powerhouse, a lifeline.

563
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:22,559
What is this intelligence you serve
and why was I brought here?

564
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:26,845
Well, as you see, I'm no longer young,

565
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,999
whereas you, Doctor, are ageless.

566
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:34,843
You exist outside
the barriers of time and space.

567
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:37,396
And you want me...

568
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:42,561
To take over this unique situation.
To take my place.

569
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:46,486
- I refuse!  - (HUMMING)

571
00:40:53,447 --> 00:40:57,122
You are here to serve us.
There is no alternative.

572
00:40:59,887 --> 00:41:03,022
- We've got to find a way out here.
- There must be a door somewhere.

573
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:05,682
- Look, if we can get the Doctor away...
- Jamie!

574
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:11,396
No. Back this way!

575
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:14,035
Resistance is useless.

576
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:18,439
Submit your will for the sake
of the greater good. It has been decided.

577
00:41:18,607 --> 00:41:21,883
I refuse.
I shall make that decision for myself.

578
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:29,681
- (HUMMING STOPS)
- You will find there is only one decision open to you.

Procedure as arranged.

- What does that mean?
- The latest chapter of the serial story.

- No!  - Aagh!

- What have you done to them?!
- They're no longer human beings, just fictional characters

600
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:51,259
Now, if you consent to take my place here,
they can be released.

601
00:42:51,324 --> 00:42:55,203
- You really would do that?
- No, my dear sir. You would.

your first official task as the new controller.

No! My answer is still no!

but you must submit.

- The Master said you'd been...

- Where do we go from here?
- Back to the Tardis.

We can't do that. It fell apart.

- It's all over now. Thank goodness.
- The Tardis broke up.

- I'm tired. I think I'll sit down and have a rest.

- Is something wrong, Zoe?
- Where do we go from here?

- Back to the Tardis.
- We can't do that. It broke up. You don't remember?

But you keep saying the same things.

Yes. It's worth trying.

- I am at your command.
- Oh, thank you, my dear sir.

00:45:17,444 --> 00:45:20,004
Perhaps you could release this for me.

- No. I don’t actually want it.

No, of course not. Everybody else uses it.
I don’t see why you shouldn’t...

his crimes he had committed.

663
00:47:50,624 --> 00:47:55,573
Word perfect. That is why I sent for
you both at this moment of crisis.

664
00:47:55,744 --> 00:47:58,542
- We need your help.
- Tell us what we must do?

665
00:48:00,104 --> 00:48:01,583
Well...

666
00:48:07,444 --> 00:48:09,951
I understand, sir, that you are
in an unhappy situation.

667
00:48:10,064 --> 00:48:13,114
- Is there anything we can do to help?
- I wish there was.

668
00:48:13,284 --> 00:48:15,242
- Look!  - What's that?

669
00:48:15,404 --> 00:48:17,281
I never saw it before.

670
00:48:17,308 --> 00:48:19,281
The Tardis!

671
00:48:19,444 --> 00:48:22,914
Safe and sound! By all that's wonderful!

672
00:48:24,564 --> 00:48:27,522
- Doctor, are you ready?
- The time has come to leave.

673
00:48:27,684 --> 00:48:29,833
- How did you find the Tardis?
- We'll explain that later.

674
00:48:30,104 --> 00:48:34,237
- Come on. We must get away.
- Just as I was thinking that all was over.

675
00:48:34,404 --> 00:48:37,282
- Oh, no.
- It's not over yet, Doctor.

676
00:48:37,444 --> 00:48:39,719
Not yet.

677
00:48:40,964 --> 00:48:43,353
Jamie! Zoe!

678
00:48:46,004 --> 00:48:49,963
(LAUGHTER)

679
00:48:51,204 --> 00:48:53,195
What's happening?

680
00:48:53,904 --> 00:48:57,214
The children obeyed perfectly.

681
00:48:57,384 --> 00:49:00,535
Their mission is completed.

682
00:49:02,584 --> 00:49:05,576
Now perhaps we can get down to business.

683
00:49:05,744 --> 00:49:08,577
As you refused to take over at the controls,

684
00:49:08,744 --> 00:49:12,054
we were forced to incorporate you
into the computer itself.

685
00:49:12,224 --> 00:49:16,137
- To what purpose?
- To bring planet Earth under our control.

686
00:49:16,304 --> 00:49:19,501
- And its people?
- We have no wish to destroy them.

687
00:49:19,664 --> 00:49:24,738
Merely adjust their minds
to suit our purpose.

688
00:49:24,904 --> 00:49:28,533
Sausages! Man would become
like a string of sausages.

689
00:49:28,704 --> 00:49:32,583
Man will simply vanish from the Earth
and reappear here.

690
00:49:32,744 --> 00:49:38,137
Leaving Earth undamaged and uninhabited
for you to take over.

691
00:49:38,304 --> 00:49:41,580
- Precisely.
- If I co-operate.

692
00:49:41,744 --> 00:49:46,499
You have no alternative.
You are part of the master brain.

693
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:51,453
So the computer
feeds off my thoughts, does it?

694
00:49:51,624 --> 00:49:53,262
Correct.

695
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:55,733
Then it will create what I think.

696
00:49:55,904 --> 00:50:01,058
Oh, no. No... You're now under control
of the master brain.

697
00:50:01,224 --> 00:50:04,954
Are you so sure?
You couldn't control my mind before...

698
00:50:05,053 --> 00:50:07,094
and you certainly can't control it now!

699
00:50:07,264 --> 00:50:09,255
- Submit!  - No!

700
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:13,815
You've given me equal power.
It's a battle of wits between you and me.

701
00:50:15,464 --> 00:50:19,298
Oh, no. No! No! Stop! Stop!

702
00:50:19,464 --> 00:50:26,256
Jamie, Zoe... Can you hear me?
Think for yourselves. Don't be afraid.

703
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:29,621
You can open the book.
Go on, you can do it.

704
00:50:29,784 --> 00:50:32,139
Oh. Oh, dear.

705
00:50:32,304 --> 00:50:36,058
This is against everything we ever worked for.

706
00:50:36,224 --> 00:50:38,784
- (HUMMING)
- Warning, warning.

707
00:50:38,944 --> 00:50:41,822
Emergency action.
Emergency. Emergency.

708
00:50:42,104 --> 00:50:44,095
Calling white robots.

709
00:50:44,264 --> 00:50:47,176
Guards will enter the control centre.

710
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:51,223
The master brain must be protected.

711
00:50:52,504 --> 00:50:55,143
Push, Zoe. Push hard.

712
00:50:55,304 --> 00:50:57,579
We will get out.

713
00:50:59,784 --> 00:51:05,973
- Soldiers! To the roof! Immediately!
- Harder. Harder!

714
00:51:06,844 --> 00:51:08,436
Splendid!

715
00:51:08,604 --> 00:51:11,755
Soldiers, forward!
Seize them! Destroy them!

716
00:51:13,464 --> 00:51:15,978
- (CREAKING)  - Get back, Zoe.

717
00:51:16,144 --> 00:51:18,339
(CREAKING)

718
00:51:19,344 --> 00:51:21,335
Can't you help us?

719
00:51:21,504 --> 00:51:27,374
We obey our creator. That is all
that can be expected of any character.

720
00:51:31,504 --> 00:51:34,462
And now, Doctor, obey me!

721
00:51:35,184 --> 00:51:36,697
No!

722
00:51:36,864 --> 00:51:40,652
Suddenly the Karkus came to their rescue.

723
00:51:43,024 --> 00:51:46,096
I am at your command.

724
00:51:46,264 --> 00:51:51,816
(DOCTOR) He raised his anti-molecular
disintegrator gun and destroyed the soldiers.

725
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:58,776
No! But the Karkus realised his mistake

726
00:51:58,944 --> 00:52:03,620
and turned back to face his real enemies,
Jamie and Zoe!

727
00:52:06,544 --> 00:52:12,562
With Jamie and Zoe fixed firmly in his sights,
the Karkus pressed the trigger of his gun.

728
00:52:13,064 --> 00:52:16,863
But... But all the power had been used up
on the soldiers and it was useless.

729
00:52:17,024 --> 00:52:21,779
- You'll have to do better than that.
- Suddenly, a swashbuckling figure appeared.

730
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:27,894
Poet and swordsman,
the famous Cyrano de Bergerac.

731
00:52:28,064 --> 00:52:33,900
Remorselessly, Cyrano advanced on those
who had dared to poke fun at his nose.

732
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:35,373
But wait.

733
00:52:35,544 --> 00:52:39,856
He found himself face to face
with the fearless musketeer

734
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:42,618
and fearless swordsman D'Artagnan!

735
00:52:50,864 --> 00:52:52,855
Come on, Zoe.

736
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:57,337
- Princess Rapunzel, can we borrow your hair again?
- Of course.

737
00:52:57,504 --> 00:53:01,053
- Why we going down there?
- We've got to find the Doctor. Come on.

738
00:53:01,224 --> 00:53:06,298
Stop them! Substitute cutlass for rapier.
Cancel Cyrano.

739
00:53:06,464 --> 00:53:08,455
Blackbeard the Pirate!

740
00:53:08,624 --> 00:53:13,903
(DOCTOR) Cancel D'Artagnan.
Substitute Sir Lancelot in full armour!

741
00:53:21,384 --> 00:53:22,703
This way.

742
00:53:25,864 --> 00:53:29,334
(MASTER IN FLAT VOICE)
The Doctor is expendable, expendable.

743
00:53:29,504 --> 00:53:31,620
He will be destroyed.

744
00:53:32,624 --> 00:53:37,140
(NORMAL VOICE) Oh, no, no.
He's the only person. There's nobody else.

745
00:53:37,304 --> 00:53:39,738
I can't go on for ever.

746
00:53:39,904 --> 00:53:43,294
Please give me another chance.

747
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:50,174
(FLAT VOICE) You have failed. The master brain
must be protected against overloading.

748
00:53:51,544 --> 00:53:54,980
Robot force will deal with him.

749
00:53:58,384 --> 00:54:02,297
Change robot weapon to destructor beam.

750
00:54:04,384 --> 00:54:06,852
(LOW BUZZ)

751
00:54:13,344 --> 00:54:19,533
It is a pity that we have to destroy
such an intelligent mind as yours, Doctor,

752
00:54:19,704 --> 00:54:23,014
but you leave us no alternative.

753
00:54:24,024 --> 00:54:25,821
Disintegrate!

754
00:54:25,984 --> 00:54:27,542
(HUMMING)

755
00:54:36,704 --> 00:54:38,695
Stop them!

756
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:44,454
They will overload the master brain!

757
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:49,017
Destroy them. Destroy.

758
00:54:50,544 --> 00:54:52,341
Oh!

759
00:54:56,904 --> 00:54:58,462
Zoe, duck!

760
00:54:58,624 --> 00:55:02,458
(GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS)

761
00:55:09,524 --> 00:55:12,675
- Shouldn't we get out of here?
- Yes. Come on, Jamie, give me a hand.

762
00:55:12,844 --> 00:55:16,632
- What do you want to bring him for?
- Don't argue, Jamie. Give a hand.

763
00:55:16,804 --> 00:55:19,272
(EXPLOSIONS)

764
00:55:19,444 --> 00:55:22,932
Why we had to bring him.
He is one of those caused the trouble.

765
00:55:23,004 --> 00:55:26,535
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm not sure where I am.

766
00:55:26,704 --> 00:55:30,219
Is this the office of the ''Ensign'' magazine?

767
00:55:30,284 --> 00:55:34,118
You were kidnapped, just like we were.
They've been using your mind.

768
00:55:34,284 --> 00:55:38,163
- What happens to us now?
- That depends on how efficient the white robots are.

769
00:55:38,224 --> 00:55:42,237
The last order was to destroy.
Let's hope they're destroying one another.

770
00:55:42,404 --> 00:55:46,079
What about the Karkus and Gulliver
and our other friends out there?

771
00:55:46,244 --> 00:55:50,396
- You can't blow up a fictional character.
- But what about us?

772
00:55:50,564 --> 00:55:53,579
We'll have to hope the destruction
of the computer returns us all to reality.

773
00:55:53,694 --> 00:55:57,216
- And you, my dear sir.
- Oh. Do you mean I'm going home?

774
00:55:57,284 --> 00:56:01,956
- I hope so.
- But it could just as well send us into oblivion.

775
00:56:02,124 --> 00:56:04,797
- You mean we could vanish for ever?
- We shall soon know.

776
00:56:04,964 --> 00:56:07,956
- (EXPLOSIONS)
- Hang on. Here it comes.
