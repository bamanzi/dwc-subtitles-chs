- You're meant to use it like Perseus.

- Maybe it's another trap.
- Doctor, please!

00:26:24,487 --> 00:26:28,400
No. How can I kill something

- I've got to open my eyes. I've got to see!
- Wait!

00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:34,727
Perseus. Of course. A mirror.

10
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:39,721
There. Look at her reflection in the mirror. Look!

11
00:26:39,887 --> 00:26:43,163
- Can you see her?
- Yes.

12
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:48,606
This is how Perseus escaped.
He looked at her reflection in his polished shield.

13
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:51,645
There's no danger in the reflection.

His companions were in a state of anxiety
about his whereabouts.

00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:46,062
Zoe and the Doctor! Where are they?

23
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:48,457
- Safe.
- You've spoken to them?

24
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:52,905

where I came from and whither I was bound.

- (BUZZING)
- What's that?

- I heard nothing.
- Probably that search party.

27
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:02,139
By law, every chamber must be searched.

28
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:06,300
- If they find me, I'm done for.
- You should be put to death.

- What about you?
- I shall come to no harm.

Young sir, I do assure you,
there were no such persons here.

35
00:28:53,227 --> 00:28:56,856
Aye. Robots or not,
I'm getting out of this place.

You desire your liberty?

37
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:08,022
Yes. I got in all right, but how do I get out?

38
00:29:08,187 --> 00:29:11,736
After some consideration,
I was of the opinion that...

Go on, go on.

40
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:17,982
..this was altogether impossible.

41
00:29:20,547 --> 00:29:26,383
Oh, yes. That's the citadel, all right.
The question is, how do we get up there?

42
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:29,778
- It's a long way to climb.
- Zoe, duck!

43
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:40,180
- The Karkus!
- You are my prisoners!

44
00:29:40,347 --> 00:29:42,656
- It's the Karkus.
- What?

45
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:45,546

- Obey or I fire.

47
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:56,382
- What sort of a gun is that?
- (ZOE) An anti-molecular ray disintegrator.

48
00:29:56,547 --> 00:30:01,780
Rubbish! Such a weapon
is scientifically impossible. It doesn't exist.

00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:03,699
Hargh!

50
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:08,145
- That takes care of that.
- I shall tear you limb from limb!

51
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:12,619

The Karkus has superhuman strength.

- The neck can't take much pressure.
- Help!

63
00:31:10,547 --> 00:31:12,856
- Do you submit?
- I submit!

- I know it.

You heard them giving orders to look for me.
Why do you suppose that happened?

00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:37,163
These were orders
given by some person in authority.

- The Master?
- It is possible.

86
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:41,758
Now I'm getting somewhere.

87
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:47,957
Listen. If there aren't any robots,
who do you think was carrying out those orders?

88
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:49,924
Who was I hiding from?

89
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:53,557
- Why, sir, the Yahoos.
- Who's the Yahoos?

90
00:32:53,727 --> 00:32:57,959
Inferior creatures.
I never beheld so disagreeable an animal.

91
00:32:58,127 --> 00:33:02,166
I haven't seen any Yahoos,
you haven't seen any robots!

92
00:33:02,327 --> 00:33:04,238
- Jamie!
- Stay where you are!

93
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:08,446
There's an electrical gadget that sets off an alarm.

94
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:11,963
The gong went off
and they sent robots after me.

95
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:15,437
- Robots? The ones we saw before?
- Big white ones.

96
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:19,600
- Doctor, did you hear that?
- Yes. I thought they'd turn up.

97
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:23,999
It's a simple photo-electric cell.
I'd better lift you over it.

98
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:28,160
- Careful, because...
- Oh, my jacket.

99
00:33:28,327 --> 00:33:30,795
What happened when you left the tunnel?

100
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:36,519
I was chased by one of those tin soldiers.
I climbed up the cliff. How do we get out?

101
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:38,678
I'm not leaving yet.

102
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:41,884
The Doctor's going to see the Master.

103
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:45,244
This resolution may appear bold and dangerous.

104
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:47,921
- You see?
- Why do you say that?

105
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:50,317
I think you should not be here.

106
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:54,719
The Master makes rules for his kingdom.
It is unwise to disobey.

107
00:33:54,887 --> 00:33:56,798
So we shouldn't see the Master?

108
00:33:56,967 --> 00:34:01,085
My advice is to swear a peace
with the Master.

109
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:05,957
Find a place to lodge, stay
with the expectation that things would mend.

110
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:11,076
Yes. Well, I'll see.
I'll think it over very carefully.

111

- Your servant.
- Your servant.

112
00:34:17,527 --> 00:34:19,518
Your servant.

113
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:24,800
- You're not going to do as he says?
- No.

114
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:28,846
I said I'd think it over.
I've thought it over. We're staying.

115
00:34:29,007 --> 00:34:34,320
But we won't know where the next attack
will come from. Medusa was bad enough.

116
00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:37,763
Ah, Medusa.
I read about that on this machine.

117
00:34:37,927 --> 00:34:41,636
- Wee words keep coming out of it.
- Let's have a look.

118
00:34:41,807 --> 00:34:43,479
There. Look.

''Cancel. Doctor test - report failure.''

120
00:34:49,247 --> 00:34:52,398
- I'm beginning to understand.
- I wish I was.

121
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:58,005
When somebody writes about an incident
after it's happened, that is history.

122
00:34:58,167 --> 00:34:59,839
- Hm?
- Yes.

123
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:04,637
But when the writing comes first,
that's fiction.

124
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:09,642
If we'd have fallen into the Master's trap,
we would have become fiction.

125
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:13,766
- That's horrible. Let's get out of here.
- Zoe, don't go...

- Gulliver walked through.

131
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:31,878
- Gulliver is not real.
- They're coming! Where can we hide?

132
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,880
- No need to hide.
- If they find us...

133
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:37,038
- Let them find us.
- Just wait?

134
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:40,563
Yes. We'll ask for an interview
with the Master.

135
00:35:40,727 --> 00:35:43,560
- They may not give us time to ask...
- Look!

How very fortunate. Do come in, Doctor.

00:36:14,687 --> 00:36:19,602
Oh, don't be alarmed.
Won't you walk into my parlour?

142
00:36:25,927 --> 00:36:28,043
Come along.

(LOW HUMMING)

144
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:41,642
- It's hard to see anything.
- Where are you?

145
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:47,000
Here! Patiently waiting.

146
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:57,802
Oh! Oh, Doctor. This is a great pleasure.

147
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:01,880
And your two young companions.
Let me see... Oh, yes.

148
00:37:02,047 --> 00:37:04,880
Zoe and Jamie. I have your dossiers here.

149
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:07,845
- You're well organised.
- Yes. We have to be.

150
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:11,966
Running this place
requires enormous attention to detail.

151
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:17,440
- It's a responsible position, but rewarding.
- Responsible, eh?

152
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:21,680
- To someone else?
- Not to someone. Another power.

153
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:24,884
Higher than any you could begin to imagine.

154
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:28,323
Oh, I must congratulate you
on the great skill

155
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:31,365
in which you tackled your examination.

156
00:37:31,527 --> 00:37:34,439
What is the purpose of all these tests?

157
00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:39,761
When I was first brought here myself,
I was as bewildered as you are.

158
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:44,762
- How long have you been here?
- I left England in the summer of 1926.

159
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:49,077
It was a very hot day, I remember.

160
00:37:50,087 --> 00:37:54,797
I think I must have dozed off over my desk,
and when I awoke...

161
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,317
But that's a long story.

162
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:03,003
Did you ever hear of the adventures
of Captain Jack Harkaway?

163
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:06,637
No, I can't say that I... Wait a minute.

164
00:38:06,807 --> 00:38:10,880
- A serial in a boys' magazine?
- The ''Ensign''.

165
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:15,359
And for 25 years,
I delivered 5,000 words every week.

166
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,518
You're a writer.

167
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:20,645
25 years, 5,000 words a week?

168
00:38:20,807 --> 00:38:25,517
- That's over half a million words.
- Yes. It was probably a record.

169
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:27,996
That's why I was selected to work here.

170
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:32,046
- You're in charge of all this?
- In one sense, yes.

171
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:35,597
Yes. Or is all this in charge of you?

172
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:42,926
My brain is the source of the creative power
which keeps this whole operation going.

173
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:47,763
I see. That means
that you are virtually a prisoner.

174
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:49,519
No, no.

175
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:52,599
(HUMMING)

176
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:03,162
You... You must excuse me
for one moment.

177
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:10,999
- Let's get out of here.
- It gives me the creeps.

178
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:16,082
- No. I need to find out more.
- Zoe and me will find a way out.

179
00:39:16,247 --> 00:39:18,477
I think we should all stick together.

180
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:24,040
- (HUMMING STOPS)
- Sorry to have kept you. Where were we?

181
00:39:24,207 --> 00:39:28,325
You were about to answer my question.
Are you a prisoner here?

182
00:39:28,487 --> 00:39:31,081
No. No, I wouldn't say that.

183
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:36,401
In fact, I rather like being here.
I have everything I could possibly want.

184
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:40,685
This vast library
with all the known works of fiction.

185
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:44,556
All the masterpieces written by Earthmen.

186
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:54,600
- I don't think he noticed.
- No. Let's try down there.

187
00:39:54,767 --> 00:40:01,684
I see, yes. And only an Earthman-type creature
has the power to create fiction.

188
00:40:01,847 --> 00:40:04,600
- The power to imagine.
- Exactly.

189
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:09,238
This is one field in which
the intelligence I serve cannot compete.

190
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:15,039
They need a man of boundless imagination
as a...um...

191
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:18,165
a powerhouse, a lifeline.

192
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:22,559
What is this intelligence you serve
and why was I brought here?

193
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:26,845
Well, as you see, I'm no longer young,

194
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,999
whereas you, Doctor, are ageless.

195
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:34,843
You exist outside
the barriers of time and space.

196
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:37,396
And you want me...

197
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:42,561
To take over this unique situation.
To take my place.

198
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:46,486
- I refuse!
- (HUMMING)

199
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:53,280
(FLAT VOICE) Refusal is impossible.

200
00:40:53,447 --> 00:40:57,122
You are here to serve us.
There is no alternative.

201
00:40:59,887 --> 00:41:04,722
- We've got to find a way out.
- There must be a door somewhere.

202
00:41:04,887 --> 00:41:07,082
Jamie!

203
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:08,919
Oh!

204
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:11,396
No. Back this way!

205
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:14,035
Resistance is useless.

206
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:18,439
Submit your will for the sake
of the greater good. It has been decided.

207
00:41:18,607 --> 00:41:21,883
I refuse.
I shall make that decision for myself.

208
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:29,681
- (HUMMING STOPS)
- There is only one decision open to you.

209
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:31,599
(HUMMING)

210
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:36,079
Mission accomplished.
Procedure as arranged.

211
00:41:36,247 --> 00:41:41,765
- What does that mean?
- The latest chapter of the serial story.

212
00:41:41,927 --> 00:41:44,395
I'll read you the last sentence.

213
00:41:44,567 --> 00:41:47,479
''Zoe and Jamie attempted to escape,

214
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:51,037
''but in making through the library,

215
00:41:51,207 --> 00:41:55,758
''they were ambushed by a party of guards
and overpowered.''

216
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:57,838
Oh, no! Jamie! Zoe!

217
00:41:58,007 --> 00:42:01,238
Are you prepared to co-operate now?

218
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:06,083
Your life in return for theirs?
Is that a bargain?

219
00:42:06,247 --> 00:42:08,158
(CHUCKLES)

220
00:42:08,327 --> 00:42:09,726
Look.

221
00:42:11,807 --> 00:42:13,604
(BUZZING)

222
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:15,758
(THEY GROAN)

223
00:42:17,647 --> 00:42:21,720
- Oh, Jamie, my eyes!
- I can't see. Where are you?

224
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,240
Quick, back. Get away.

225
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:28,477
Zoe, here, quick.

226
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:32,521
No. It's a book! Back out again.

227
00:42:32,687 --> 00:42:37,078
- Oh! Oh, push!
- Open up! It's closing!

228
00:42:37,247 --> 00:42:39,841
- No!
- Aagh!

229
01:01:18,087 --> 01:01:20,078
(DOCTOR WHO THEME)

230
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:57,999
(HISSING)

231
01:02:05,367 --> 01:02:08,677
Don't look in her eyes! Don't look!

232
01:02:08,847 --> 01:02:12,044
The Medusa does not exist.
You must believe that.

233
01:02:12,207 --> 01:02:16,883
- I can feel her fingertips like ice!
- No. That's marble.

234
01:02:17,047 --> 01:02:19,766
Think of her as a marble statue. A legend.

235
01:02:19,927 --> 01:02:23,681
But she's real!
I've got to look at her! I've got to!

236
01:28:23,927 --> 01:28:27,476
It's safe now. You can look now.

237
01:28:29,447 --> 01:28:32,917
The statue has become a statue again.

238
01:33:11,887 --> 01:33:15,880
We all follow his adventures
in the ''Hourly Telepress''.

239
01:33:17,247 --> 01:33:21,001
Oh, a strip cartoon of the year 2000?

240
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:23,362
You've been in the year 2000?

241
01:33:23,527 --> 01:33:26,041
Yes, but I had no time to follow cartoons.

242
01:33:26,207 --> 01:33:29,643
You'd better start following this one.
He's halfway there.
