- I take it, then, that you agree?

No! My answer is still no!

00:55:38,624 --> 00:55:42,537
The order was to destroy.
Let's hope they're destroying one another.

172
00:55:42,704 --> 00:55:46,379
What about the Karkus and Gulliver
and our friends?

173
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:50,696
- You can't blow up a fictional character.
- But what about us?

174
00:55:50,864 --> 00:55:55,779
We'll have to hope the destruction
of the computer returns us all to reality.

175
00:55:55,944 --> 00:55:59,016
- Oh. Do you mean I'm going home?
- I hope so.

176
00:55:59,184 --> 00:56:02,256
But it could just as well send us into oblivion.

177
00:56:02,424 --> 00:56:05,097
- Vanish for ever?
- We shall soon know.

178
00:56:05,264 --> 00:56:08,256
- (EXPLOSIONS)
- Hang on. Here it comes.
