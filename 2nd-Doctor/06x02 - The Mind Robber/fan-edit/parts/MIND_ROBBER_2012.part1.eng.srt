00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:21,355
Doctor, come on, will you? Look!

3
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:25,838
Oh, my word! Into the Tardis. Quickly.

4
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:34,697
Oh, no! If I can't pull this down,
we'll get stuck. That stupid, idiotic...

5
00:00:35,587 --> 00:00:37,377
Doctor, the lava's up to the Tardis!

6
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:40,641
If I can unstick this stupid, idiotic...

7
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,604
There we are.

8
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:47,238
- Have you done it?
- It's stopped the fluid links from vaporising.

9
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:51,639
- We shan't suffocate.
- If we don't hurry, we'll be fried by the lava.

10
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:56,676
- Isn't there any way we can get away?
- Well, there IS an emergency unit, but...

11
00:00:56,847 --> 00:01:00,237
- I can't possibly use that.
- But this IS an emergency!

12
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:04,844
But it moves the Tardis out of the 
time-space dimension, out of reality!

13
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:08,317
Fine. Reality's getting too hot, anyway!

14
00:01:11,147 --> 00:01:14,822
I can't possibly use this.
We don't know what will happen.

15
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:18,263
Stop your jabbering and get on with it. Look!

Where are you?

22
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:53,563
What do you want with me?

23
00:01:56,247 --> 00:01:58,397
No...

24
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:01,525
No, I must fight.

25
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:03,837
I must fight!

26
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:07,079
I will fight!
