(JAMIE LAUGHS) Oh, Zoe!

- (LAUGHING)
- (ZOE) Get me out!

Not unless you promise to be a good girl!

(ZOE) Oh, you...!

181
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,552
Go on. Get her out.

182
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:33,786
Come on, then. Up you come.

One, two, three...

184
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:41,584
I thought I was never going to get out of...
Who are you?

185
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:46,876
Eh? Och, don't you start, Zoe.
I've had enough from the Doctor. I'm me.

186
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:48,628
Jamie!

187
00:13:49,476 --> 00:13:54,072
- Why does he look so different?
- Well, I'll... I'll tell you later.

188
00:13:54,236 --> 00:13:58,787
- It's time we got out of this wood.
- Aye. This place gives me the creeps.

189
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:01,595
You go on ahead, Jamie.

190
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:06,351
- Is that really Jamie?
- Well... Well, yes.

191
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:10,111
He couldn't just have changed like that.
It's impossible.

192
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:15,270
I think we may be in a place
where nothing is impossible. Come on.

Oh, how much further?

00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:31,502
There's no sign of the toy soldiers now.

196
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:34,660
- We've got to get out of this place.
- Look.

197
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:36,944
There's a house.

198

00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:47,622
- Doctor!
- It's all right, Zoe.

201
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:53,022
Well, come on. If you want to play games,
let's get on with it.

What's that?

204

I have to make up his face again.

205
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:02,498
- You did this before!
- Yes.

206
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,943
That's how Jamie's face got changed.

207
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:07,906
- You got it all wrong!
- What? No, no.

208
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:09,899
Well, I was rushed.

209
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:12,821

210
00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:16,303
All right, I know!

There we are.

You can't mistake his nose, can you?

- I haven't been anywhere.
- You've got your face back.

- I have?
- Yes. Look.

219
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:46,828
You're right, I have! That's much better.

00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:25,265
- We could easily get lost in there.
- Just a moment.

227
00:16:25,428 --> 00:16:27,419
What's he found?

228
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:29,579
A ball of twine.

229
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:34,458
Hmm... Oh, yes...
This must have been an invitation.

230
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,619
Why?

231
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:41,862
It's the classical way of getting through a maze.
Tie that to the door, will you?

232
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:44,781
It's locked.

233
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:49,257
- Then we ARE meant to go on.
- Yes, I think we are.

234
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:54,821
But that means that wherever we go,
at any time, they know. They're expecting us.

235
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:58,617
Yes... Don't break the thread. Come along.

236
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:05,983
- Which way, do you think?
- To the right.

237
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:09,860
(DOCTOR) They look equally unattractive
to me.

238
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:13,020
It must be to the right.
I've been working it out.

- Doctor...
- Shh! How?

240
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:17,946
It soon fell into a clear pattern.

241
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:23,660
One left, two right, three left, four right
and so on. A simple arithmetical progression.

- Doctor...
- Shh!

243
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:28,823
What it is to have an arithmetical brain!
What do you want?

The thread's run out. Should we not go back?

245
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:37,580
No. You stay here
and Zoe and I will explore a little further.

246
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:41,661
There must be another way out of this maze.
I need to find it.

247
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:47,784
They don't want us to find a way out,
only a way in!

I was right. This isn't the way out.

We're in the middle of the maze.

- Doctor, I don't like it. Let's go.
- Just a moment.

I was rather expecting a welcoming
committee, but perhaps I was wrong.

Half-man, half-bull, yes.

261
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:48,907
And he lived in the heart of a labyrinth.

And there were human sacrifices!

00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:52,364
With that wee lighthouse of yours.

00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:10,718
(MASTER) No! Brainless idiot.
Get yourself free. Don't let the boy escape!

280
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:46,717
- I think this is the place.
- Yes.

281
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:51,086
There's no sign of him.
I'm sure he wouldn't have gone off without...

282
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:53,318
- What's that?
- His jacket.

283
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:57,720
- Well, he must be around here somewhere.
- Jamie!

284
00:20:57,888 --> 00:20:59,207
Who's that?

285
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,403
- My dear sir!
- Your servant, sir.

286
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:06,038
- You keep turning up unexpectedly.
- Have you seen Jamie?

287
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:09,623
I walked alone
but saw no sign of any inhabitants.

288
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:14,100
- (ZOE) Are you positive?
- I would not impose any falsities upon you.

289
00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:16,862
- I adhere strictly to truth.
- Of course.

290
00:21:17,828 --> 00:21:21,582
This person who controls this place...

291
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,581
- The Master?
- The Master? Yes?

292
00:21:24,748 --> 00:21:26,227
Have you seen him?

293
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:29,778
Upon occasion he has been pleased
to grant me an audience.

294
00:21:30,828 --> 00:21:32,227
Where might I find him?

295
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:39,019
The Master's palace is a citadel,
a walled town at the top of a hill or cliff,

296
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:40,860
the highest in the kingdom.

297
00:21:41,028 --> 00:21:42,939
Now I think I understand.

298
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:47,738
May I ask, sir, where you come from?
Would it not be Nottingham?

299
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:52,698
My father had a small estate in Nottingham.
I was the third of five sons.

300
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:56,224
He sent me to Emmanuel College
in Cambridge at 14,

301
00:21:56,388 --> 00:22:00,745
where I applied myself
to learning navigation and mathematics...

(BOTH) Useful for those who intend to travel,

303
00:22:03,828 --> 00:22:07,184
as I always believed
it would be my fortune to do.

304
00:22:07,348 --> 00:22:09,020
Now I know who you are, sir.

305
00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:12,498
- Your name is Lemuel Gulliver!
- Your servant, sir.

306
00:22:12,668 --> 00:22:14,340
- Gulliver?
- Yes.

00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,466
Oh, no!

308
00:22:24,788 --> 00:22:28,383
I'd need to be a human fly to get up that lot.

309
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:32,097
I can't go back, though.
What I really need is a...

Who says wishes don't come true?

00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:53,740
Ouch!

312
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:58,820
- I suppose you know that hurts?
- You mean this is your hair?

313
00:22:58,988 --> 00:23:04,062
Of course. I don't object to people climbing it -
I'm quite used to it, actually -

314
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:06,981
- but you would keep tugging so.
- I'm sorry.

315
00:23:07,148 --> 00:23:08,979
- Are you a prince?
- No. Why?

316
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:13,380
You're supposed to be.
I'm a princess, but I suppose you knew that.

317
00:23:13,548 --> 00:23:17,700
My name's Rapunzel. You're not
a woodcutter's son, by any chance?

318
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:21,224
- No. I'm the son of a piper.
- How very disappointing.

319
00:23:21,388 --> 00:23:23,026
You'd better go. Goodbye.

320
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:24,780
- Wait!
- Well?

321
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:30,500
I can't go back there. It's a sheer drop.
I'll have to climb in through the window.

322
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:34,343
- I don't know if that would be allowed.
- I won't stay long.

323
00:23:34,508 --> 00:23:36,897
Just passing through, you might say.

324
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:41,698
- Och, please.
- It's a great pity you're not a prince.

325
00:23:41,868 --> 00:23:44,018
You'd have made rather a good one.

326
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:46,861
Well, I suppose you'd better come inside.

327
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:49,542
For goodness' sake, be quiet.

328
00:23:56,828 --> 00:23:58,580
Rapunzel!

329
00:23:58,748 --> 00:24:01,057
Your Highness, where have you gone?

330
00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:03,867
Don't be silly. I'm not going...

331
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:09,261
Hey, this doesn't look like
the inside of a princess's castle to me.

332
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:17,382
but it would not be proper to trouble you
with the particulars of my adventures.

333
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:19,698
I wouldn't dream of detaining you.

334
00:24:19,868 --> 00:24:22,985
Having been condemned by nature
to an active life,

335
00:24:23,148 --> 00:24:25,537
I must take my leave of you. Farewell.

336
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,858
Farewell.

337
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:30,940
Why does he talk
in such an extraordinary way?

338
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:34,578
He can only speak the words
that Dean Swift gave him to say.

339
00:24:34,748 --> 00:24:37,820
That's ridiculous. There never was a Gulliver.

340
00:24:37,988 --> 00:24:40,980
- He's a fictional character.
- Of course he is.

341
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:45,505
This world that we've tumbled into
is a world of fiction -

342
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:55,736
''The Doctor and Zoe,

343
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:59,617
''unable to find their companion
in the labyrinth,

344
00:24:59,788 --> 00:25:04,225
''decided to return to the cave
in search of him,

345
00:25:04,388 --> 00:25:08,301
''where a new terror awaited them.''

346
00:25:09,348 --> 00:25:11,782
That wasn't there before, was it?

347
00:25:11,948 --> 00:25:13,418
- A statue.

349
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:21,198
(DOCTOR) Medusa!

350
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:31,247
''The Doctor and Zoe...
were face to face with Medusa.

351
00:25:31,408 --> 00:25:33,638
''One glance from her eyes would...

352
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:36,163
''would turn them to stone.''

353
00:25:38,008 --> 00:25:41,796
- Now we know what we have to do, Zoe.
- Yes.

354
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:43,765
(HISSING)

355
00:25:43,928 --> 00:25:46,442
She's moving. She's going to look at us!

356
00:25:48,008 --> 00:25:51,796
- We have to say Medusa does not exist.
- But she does!

357
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:55,324
Zoe, Medusa is a myth.

358
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:59,006
If you believe in her, 
she can turn us both to stone.

359
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:03,840
''One glance from her eyes
would turn them to stone...

360
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:07,879
''but all was not yet lost.

00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:12,598
''Suddenly, the Doctor found a sword
at his feet, picked it up

00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:17,079
''and with one stroke slew the monster.''

363
00:26:17,247 --> 00:26:21,126
- A sword!
- You're meant to use it like Perseus.

364
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:24,324
- Maybe it's another trap.
- Doctor, please!

365
00:26:24,487 --> 00:26:28,400
No. How can I kill something
that doesn't exist?

366
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:32,003
- I've got to open my eyes. I've got to see!
- Wait!

367
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:34,727
Perseus. Of course. A mirror.

368
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:39,721
There. Look at her reflection in the mirror. Look!

369
00:26:39,887 --> 00:26:43,163
- Can you see her?
- Yes.

370
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:48,606
This is how Perseus escaped.
He looked at her reflection in his polished shield.

371
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:51,645
There's no danger in the reflection.

- Have you been sent to find me?

379
00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:43,695
His companions were in a state of anxiety
about his whereabouts.

380
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:46,062
Zoe and the Doctor! Where are they?

381
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:48,457
- Safe.
- You've spoken to them?

382
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:52,905
The gentleman desired to know
where I came from and whither I was bound.

- (BUZZING)
- What's that?

384
00:27:55,627 --> 00:27:58,903
- I heard nothing.
- Probably that search party.

385
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:02,139
By law, every chamber must be searched.

386
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:06,300
- If they find me, I'm done for.
- You should be put to death.

387
00:28:08,627 --> 00:28:11,346
- What about you?
- I shall come to no harm.

388
00:28:11,507 --> 00:28:14,499
If you give me away this time, I'm finished.

Where have they gone? The white robots.

392
00:28:48,547 --> 00:28:53,063
Young sir, I do assure you,
there were no such persons here.

393
00:28:53,227 --> 00:28:56,856
Aye. Robots or not,
I'm getting out of this place.

394
00:29:02,347 --> 00:29:04,338
You desire your liberty?

395
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:08,022
Yes. I got in all right, but how do I get out?

396
00:29:08,187 --> 00:29:11,736
After some consideration,
I was of the opinion that...

397
00:29:11,907 --> 00:29:14,296
Go on, go on.

398
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:17,982
..this was altogether impossible.

399
00:29:20,547 --> 00:29:26,383
Oh, yes. That's the citadel, all right.
The question is, how do we get up there?

400
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:29,778
- It's a long way to climb.
- Zoe, duck!

401
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:40,180
- The Karkus!
- You are my prisoners!

402
00:29:40,347 --> 00:29:42,656
- It's the Karkus.
- What?

403
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:45,546
Come out
and put ze hands above ze head.

404
00:29:47,027 --> 00:29:51,305
- You know. He's fictional too.
- Obey or I fire.

405
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:56,382
- What sort of a gun is that?
- (ZOE) An anti-molecular ray disintegrator.

406
00:29:56,547 --> 00:30:01,780
Rubbish! Such a weapon
is scientifically impossible. It doesn't exist.

407
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:03,699
Hargh!

408
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:08,145
- That takes care of that.
- I shall tear you limb from limb!

409
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:12,619
Doctor, be careful.
The Karkus has superhuman strength.

410
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:14,778
You will be mincemeat!

411
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:18,064
Doctor, say it!
You know he's a fictional character.

412
00:30:18,227 --> 00:30:20,104
But I've never heard of him!

413
00:30:20,267 --> 00:30:23,623
- Hargh!
- What are you doing?

414
00:30:23,787 --> 00:30:26,460
Please, I'm sure we can talk this over.

415
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:29,898
- Zoe!
- Lesson 17!

416
00:30:30,907 --> 00:30:32,977
- Be careful.
- Oh, dear!

(ZOE) Lesson 32!

00:30:49,467 --> 00:30:51,458
Don't do anything rash!

419
00:31:04,627 --> 00:31:06,618
- Mercy!
- You'd better submit.

420
00:31:06,787 --> 00:31:10,382
- The neck can't take much pressure.
- Help!

421
00:31:10,547 --> 00:31:12,856
- Do you submit?
- I submit!

422
00:31:14,107 --> 00:31:16,098
That's better.

423
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:20,704
I am your slave. Command me.

424
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:24,496
- Do you know the way to the citadel?
- I know it.

425
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:27,227

- K-A-R-K-U-S.
- Oh, yes. Mr Karkus. Thank you.

00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:44,238
We won't be needing you any longer. Run along.

430
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:47,364

00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:52,003
- Come along.
- You can't just ring the bell.

441
00:32:28,087 --> 00:32:33,719
You heard them giving orders to look for me.
Why do you suppose that happened?

442
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:37,163
These were orders
given by some person in authority.

443
00:32:37,327 --> 00:32:39,602
- The Master?
- It is possible.

444
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:41,758
Now I'm getting somewhere.

445
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:47,957
Listen. If there aren't any robots,
who do you think was carrying out those orders?

446
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:49,924
Who was I hiding from?

447
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:53,557
- Why, sir, the Yahoos.
- Who's the Yahoos?

448
00:32:53,727 --> 00:32:57,959
Inferior creatures.
I never beheld so disagreeable an animal.

449
00:32:58,127 --> 00:33:02,166
I haven't seen any Yahoos,
you haven't seen any robots!

450
00:33:02,327 --> 00:33:04,238
- Jamie!
- Stay where you are!

451
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:08,446
There's an electrical gadget that sets off an alarm.

452
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:11,963
The gong went off
and they sent robots after me.

453
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:15,437
- Robots? The ones we saw before?
- Big white ones.

454
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:19,600
- Doctor, did you hear that?
- Yes. I thought they'd turn up.

455
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:23,999
It's a simple photo-electric cell.
I'd better lift you over it.

456
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:28,160
- Careful, because...
- Oh, my jacket.

457
00:33:28,327 --> 00:33:30,795
What happened when you left the tunnel?

458
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:36,519
I was chased by one of those tin soldiers.
I climbed up the cliff. How do we get out?

459
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:38,678
I'm not leaving yet.

460
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:41,884
The Doctor's going to see the Master.

461
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:45,244
This resolution may appear bold and dangerous.

462
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:47,921
- You see?
- Why do you say that?

463
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:50,317
I think you should not be here.

464
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:54,719
The Master makes rules for his kingdom.
It is unwise to disobey.

465
00:33:54,887 --> 00:33:56,798
So we shouldn't see the Master?

466
00:33:56,967 --> 00:34:01,085
My advice is to swear a peace
with the Master.

467
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:05,957
Find a place to lodge, stay
with the expectation that things would mend.

468
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:11,076
Yes. Well, I'll see.
I'll think it over very carefully.

- Your servant.
- Your servant.

470
00:34:17,527 --> 00:34:19,518
Your servant.

471
00:34:22,047 --> 00:34:24,800
- You're not going to do as he says?
- No.

472
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:28,846
I said I'd think it over.
I've thought it over. We're staying.

473
00:34:29,007 --> 00:34:34,320
But we won't know where the next attack
will come from. Medusa was bad enough.

474
00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:37,763
Ah, Medusa.
I read about that on this machine.

475
00:34:37,927 --> 00:34:41,636
- Wee words keep coming out of it.
- Let's have a look.

476
00:34:41,807 --> 00:34:43,479
There. Look.

478
00:34:49,247 --> 00:34:52,398
- I'm beginning to understand.
- I wish I was.

479
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:58,005
When somebody writes about an incident
after it's happened, that is history.

480
00:34:58,167 --> 00:34:59,839
- Hm?
- Yes.

481
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:04,637
But when the writing comes first,
that's fiction.

482
00:35:04,807 --> 00:35:09,642
If we'd have fallen into the Master's trap,
we would have become fiction.

483
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:13,766
- That's horrible. Let's get out of here.
- Zoe, don't go...

- Gulliver walked through.

489
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:31,878
- Gulliver is not real.
- They're coming! Where can we hide?

490
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,880
- No need to hide.
- If they find us...

491
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:37,038
- Let them find us.
- Just wait?

492
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:40,563
Yes. We'll ask for an interview
with the Master.

493
00:35:40,727 --> 00:35:43,560
- They may not give us time to ask...
- Look!

00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:41,642
- It's hard to see anything.
- Where are you?

503
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:47,000
Here! Patiently waiting.

504
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:57,802
Oh! Oh, Doctor. This is a great pleasure.

505
00:36:57,967 --> 00:37:01,880
And your two young companions.
Let me see... Oh, yes.

506
00:37:02,047 --> 00:37:04,880
Zoe and Jamie. I have your dossiers here.

507
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:07,845
- You're well organised.
- Yes. We have to be.

508
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:11,966
Running this place
requires enormous attention to detail.

509
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:17,440
- It's a responsible position, but rewarding.
- Responsible, eh?

510
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:21,680
- To someone else?
- Not to someone. Another power.

511
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:24,884
Higher than any you could begin to imagine.

512
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:28,323
Oh, I must congratulate you
on the great skill

513
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:31,365
in which you tackled your examination.

514
00:37:31,527 --> 00:37:34,439
What is the purpose of all these tests?

515
00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:39,761
When I was first brought here myself,
I was as bewildered as you are.

516
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:44,762
- How long have you been here?
- I left England in the summer of 1926.

517
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:49,077
It was a very hot day, I remember.

518
00:37:50,087 --> 00:37:54,797
I think I must have dozed off over my desk,
and when I awoke...

519
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,317
But that's a long story.

520
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:03,003
Did you ever hear of the adventures
of Captain Jack Harkaway?

521
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:06,637
No, I can't say that I... Wait a minute.

522
00:38:06,807 --> 00:38:10,880
- A serial in a boys' magazine?
- The ''Ensign''.

523
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:15,359
And for 25 years,
I delivered 5,000 words every week.

524
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,518
You're a writer.

525
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:20,645
25 years, 5,000 words a week?

526
00:38:20,807 --> 00:38:25,517
- That's over half a million words.
- Yes. It was probably a record.

527
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:27,996
That's why I was selected to work here.

528
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:32,046
- You're in charge of all this?
- In one sense, yes.

529
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:35,597
Yes. Or is all this in charge of you?

530
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:42,926
My brain is the source of the creative power
which keeps this whole operation going.

531
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:47,763
I see. That means
that you are virtually a prisoner.

532
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:49,519
No, no.

534
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:03,162
You... You must excuse me
for one moment.

535
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:10,999
- Let's get out of here.
- It gives me the creeps.

536
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:16,082
- No. I need to find out more.
- Zoe and me will find a way out.

537
00:39:16,247 --> 00:39:18,477
I think we should all stick together.

538
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:24,040
- (HUMMING STOPS)
- Sorry to have kept you. Where were we?

539
00:39:24,207 --> 00:39:28,325
You were about to answer my question.
Are you a prisoner here?

540
00:39:28,487 --> 00:39:31,081
No. No, I wouldn't say that.

541
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:36,401
In fact, I rather like being here.
I have everything I could possibly want.

542
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:40,685
This vast library
with all the known works of fiction.

543
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:44,556
All the masterpieces written by Earthmen.

544
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:54,600
- I don't think he noticed.
- No. Let's try down there.

545
00:39:54,767 --> 00:40:01,684
I see, yes. And only an Earthman-type creature
has the power to create fiction.

546
00:40:01,847 --> 00:40:04,600
- The power to imagine.
- Exactly.

547
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:09,238
This is one field in which
the intelligence I serve cannot compete.

548
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:15,039
They need a man of boundless imagination
as a...um...

549
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:18,165
a powerhouse, a lifeline.

550
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:22,559
What is this intelligence you serve
and why was I brought here?

551
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:26,845
Well, as you see, I'm no longer young,

552
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,999
whereas you, Doctor, are ageless.

553
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:34,843
You exist outside
the barriers of time and space.

554
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:37,396
And you want me...

555
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:42,561
To take over this unique situation.
To take my place.

556
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:46,486
- I refuse!

There is no alternative.

- There must be a door somewhere.

No. Back this way!

Resistance is useless.

564
00:41:14,207 --> 00:41:18,439
Submit your will for the sake
of the greater good. It has been decided.

565
00:41:18,607 --> 00:41:21,883
I refuse.
I shall make that decision for myself.

You must believe that.

- I can feel her fingertips like ice!
- No. That's marble.

Think of her as a marble statue. A legend.

I've got to look at her! I've got to!

We can't. It fell apart.

- It's all over now.
- The Tardis broke up.

- Yes, you said that.
- I'm tired. I think I'll sit down.

00:48:01,624 --> 00:48:03,535
âª A-tishoo! A-tishoo!

669
00:48:03,704 --> 00:48:06,013
âª We all fall down! âª

670
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:11,701
- You are in an unhappy situation.
- Is there anything we can do to help?

671
00:48:11,864 --> 00:48:14,014
- I wish there was.
- Look!

672
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:17,142
- What's that?
- I never saw it before.

673
00:48:17,304 --> 00:48:19,181
The Tardis!

674
00:48:19,344 --> 00:48:22,814
Safe and sound! By all that's wonderful!

675
00:48:24,464 --> 00:48:27,422
- Are you ready?
- The time has come to leave.

676
00:48:27,584 --> 00:48:31,133
- How did you find the Tardis?
- We'll explain later.

677
00:48:31,304 --> 00:48:34,137
Just as I was thinking that all was over.

678
00:48:34,304 --> 00:48:37,182
- Oh, no.
- It's not over yet, Doctor.

679
00:48:37,344 --> 00:48:39,619
Not yet.

680
00:48:40,864 --> 00:48:43,253
Jamie! Zoe!

681
00:48:45,904 --> 00:48:49,863
(LAUGHTER)

682
00:48:51,104 --> 00:48:53,095
What's happening?

683
00:48:53,804 --> 00:48:57,114
The children obeyed perfectly.

684
00:48:57,284 --> 00:49:00,435
Their mission is completed.

685
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:05,476
Now perhaps we can get down to business.

686
00:49:05,644 --> 00:49:08,477
As you refused to take over at the controls,

687
00:49:08,644 --> 00:49:11,954
we were forced to incorporate you
into the computer.

688
00:49:12,124 --> 00:49:16,037
- To what purpose?
- To bring planet Earth under our control.

689
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:19,401
- And its people?
- We have no wish to destroy them.

690
00:49:19,564 --> 00:49:24,638
Merely adjust their minds
to suit our purpose.

691
00:49:24,804 --> 00:49:28,433
Sausages! Man would become
like a string of sausages.

692
00:49:28,604 --> 00:49:32,483
Man will simply vanish from the Earth
and reappear here.

693
00:49:32,644 --> 00:49:38,037
Leaving Earth undamaged and uninhabited
for you to take over.

694
00:49:38,204 --> 00:49:41,480
- Precisely.
- If I co-operate.

695
00:49:41,644 --> 00:49:46,399
You have no alternative.
You are part of the master brain.

696
00:49:47,804 --> 00:49:51,353
So the computer
feeds off my thoughts, does it?

697
00:49:51,524 --> 00:49:53,162
Correct.

698
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,633
Then it will create what I think.

699
00:49:55,804 --> 00:50:00,958
Oh, no. No... You're now under control
of the master brain.

700
00:50:01,124 --> 00:50:06,994
Are you so sure? You couldn't control my
mind before and you can't control it now!

701
00:50:07,164 --> 00:50:09,155
- Submit!
- No!

702
00:50:09,324 --> 00:50:13,715
You've given me equal power.
It's a battle of wits between you and me.

703
00:50:15,364 --> 00:50:19,198
Oh, no. No! No! Stop! Stop!

704
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:26,156
Jamie, Zoe... Can you hear me?
Think for yourselves. Don't be afraid.

705
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:29,521
You can open the book.
Go on, you can do it.

706
00:50:29,684 --> 00:50:32,039
Oh. Oh, dear.

707
00:50:32,204 --> 00:50:35,958
This is against everything we ever worked for.

708
00:50:36,124 --> 00:50:38,684
- (HUMMING)
- Warning, warning.

709
00:50:38,844 --> 00:50:41,722
Emergency action.
Emergency. Emergency.

710
00:50:42,004 --> 00:50:43,995
Calling white robots.

711
00:50:44,164 --> 00:50:47,076
Guards will enter the control centre.

712
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:51,123
The master brain must be protected.

713
00:50:52,404 --> 00:50:55,043
Push, Zoe. Push hard.

714
00:50:55,204 --> 00:50:57,479
We will get out.

715
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:05,873
- Soldiers! To the roof! Immediately!
- Harder. Harder!

716
00:51:06,744 --> 00:51:08,336
Splendid!

717
00:51:08,504 --> 00:51:11,655
Soldiers, forward!
Seize them! Destroy them!

718
00:51:13,364 --> 00:51:15,878
- (CREAKING)
- Get back, Zoe.

719
00:51:16,044 --> 00:51:18,239
(CREAKING)

720
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:21,235
Can't you help us?

721
00:51:21,404 --> 00:51:27,274
We obey our creator. That is all
that can be expected of any character.

722
00:51:31,404 --> 00:51:34,362
And now, Doctor, obey me!

723
00:51:35,284 --> 00:51:36,797
No!

724
00:51:36,964 --> 00:51:40,752
Suddenly the Karkus came to their rescue.

725
00:51:43,124 --> 00:51:46,196
I am at your command.

726
00:51:46,364 --> 00:51:51,916
(DOCTOR) He raised his anti-molecular
disintegrator gun and destroyed them.

727
00:51:55,044 --> 00:51:58,876
No! But the Karkus realised his mistake

728
00:51:59,044 --> 00:52:03,720
and turned back to face his real enemies,
Jamie and Zoe!

729
00:52:06,644 --> 00:52:12,162
With Jamie and Zoe firmly in his sights,
the Karkus pressed the trigger of his gun.

730
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:16,963
But... But all the power had been used up
on the soldiers and it was useless.

731
00:52:17,124 --> 00:52:21,879
- You'll have to do better than that.
- A swashbuckling figure appeared.

732
00:52:22,044 --> 00:52:27,994
Poet and swordsman,
the famous Cyrano de Bergerac.

733
00:52:28,164 --> 00:52:34,000
Remorselessly, Cyrano advanced on those
who had dared to poke fun at his nose.

734
00:52:34,164 --> 00:52:35,473
But wait.

735
00:52:35,644 --> 00:52:39,956
He found himself face to face
with the fearless musketeer

736
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:42,718
and fearless swordsman D'Artagnan!

737
00:52:50,964 --> 00:52:52,955
Come on, Zoe.

738
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:57,437
- Princess, can we use your hair?
- Of course.

739
00:52:57,604 --> 00:53:01,153
- Why are we going there?
- We've got to find the Doctor.

740
00:53:01,324 --> 00:53:06,398
Stop them! Substitute cutlass for rapier.
Cancel Cyrano.

741
00:53:06,564 --> 00:53:08,555
Blackbeard the Pirate!

742
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:14,003
(DOCTOR) Cancel D'Artagnan.
Substitute Sir Lancelot in full armour!

743
00:53:21,484 --> 00:53:22,803
This way.

744
00:53:25,964 --> 00:53:29,434
(MASTER IN FLAT VOICE)
The Doctor is expendable.

745
00:53:29,604 --> 00:53:31,720
He will be destroyed.

746
00:53:32,724 --> 00:53:37,240
(NORMAL VOICE) Oh, no, no.
He's the only person. There's nobody else.

747
00:53:37,404 --> 00:53:39,838
I can't go on for ever.

748
00:53:40,004 --> 00:53:43,394
Please give me another chance.

749
00:53:44,404 --> 00:53:50,274
(FLAT VOICE) The master brain
must be protected against overloading.

750
00:53:51,644 --> 00:53:55,080
Robot force will deal with him.

751
00:53:58,484 --> 00:54:02,397
Change robot weapon to destructor beam.

752
00:54:04,484 --> 00:54:06,952
(LOW BUZZ)

753
00:54:13,444 --> 00:54:19,633
It is a pity that we have to destroy
such an intelligent mind as yours, Doctor,

754
00:54:19,804 --> 00:54:23,114
but you leave us no alternative.

755
00:54:24,124 --> 00:54:25,921
Disintegrate!

756
00:54:26,084 --> 00:54:27,642
(HUMMING)

757
00:54:36,804 --> 00:54:38,795
Stop them!

758
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:44,554
They will overload the master brain!

759
00:54:46,444 --> 00:54:49,117
Destroy them. Destroy.

760
00:54:50,644 --> 00:54:52,441
Oh!

761
00:54:57,004 --> 00:54:58,562
Zoe, duck!

762
00:54:58,724 --> 00:55:02,558
(GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS)

763
00:55:09,624 --> 00:55:12,775
- Shouldn't we go?
- Yes. Jamie, give me a hand.

764
00:55:12,944 --> 00:55:16,732
- What do you want to bring him for?
- Don't argue, Jamie.

765
00:55:16,904 --> 00:55:19,372
(EXPLOSIONS)

766
00:55:19,544 --> 00:55:23,332
I don't see why we had to bring him.
He caused the trouble.

767
00:55:23,504 --> 00:55:26,735
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm not sure where I am.

768
00:55:26,904 --> 00:55:30,419
Is this the office of the ''Ensign'' magazine?

769
00:55:30,584 --> 00:55:34,418
You were kidnapped.
They've been using your mind.

770
00:55:34,584 --> 00:55:38,463
- What happens to us now?
- That depends on the white robots.

771
00:55:38,624 --> 00:55:42,537
The order was to destroy.
Let's hope they're destroying one another.

772
00:55:42,704 --> 00:55:46,379
What about the Karkus and Gulliver
and our friends?

773
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:50,696
- You can't blow up a fictional character.
- But what about us?

774
00:55:50,864 --> 00:55:55,779
We'll have to hope the destruction
of the computer returns us all to reality.

775
00:55:55,944 --> 00:55:59,016
- Oh. Do you mean I'm going home?
- I hope so.

776
00:55:59,184 --> 00:56:02,256
But it could just as well send us into oblivion.

777
00:56:02,424 --> 00:56:05,097
- Vanish for ever?
- We shall soon know.

778
00:56:05,264 --> 00:56:08,256
- (EXPLOSIONS)
- Hang on. Here it comes.
