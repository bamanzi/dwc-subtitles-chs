122
00:43:32,436 --> 00:43:33,722
For as long as I say so.
我说多久就多久

123
00:43:33,882 --> 00:43:34,526
Yes sir.
好的, 长官

124
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,285
It seems that Salamander's locked himself away
and can't be got at.
看起来 Salamander 把他自己锁起来了, 找不到了 fixme

125
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:28,162
So?
那?

126
00:45:28,306 --> 00:45:30,100
Well, suppose the place caught fire?
哦, 加入这个地方着火了呢？

127
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:31,120
It won't.
不会的

128
00:45:31,266 --> 00:45:32,093
Don't be foolish!
被犯傻！

129
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:35,398
Look, I can only tell you that when Salamander works in records,
听着, Salamander 在fixme, 他时不时这样

129
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:38,498
as he does from time to time, no one is allowed in.
我只能告诉你, 这个时候不允许任何人进去

130
00:45:38,658 --> 00:45:45,192
I can understand if it were a... er... a... laboratory
or... a... research room of some sort, but a... /45.2
要是这是一间...实验室或者...某种研究室, 我还能理解, 但是....

130
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:49,192
a records room? What sort of records have you got in there anyway?
一间fixme? 你们那里面有什么样的fixme?

131
00:45:49,335 --> 00:45:50,399
What did you want to see him about?
你想见他做什么？

132
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:52,917
Never mind. I just don't like mysteries. /52.9
没什么, 我只是不喜欢这么神秘

132
00:45:53,031 --> 00:45:56,917
Salamander's far too important to lock himself away like this,
Salamander 太重要了, 不能这样把自己锁起来

132
00:45:57,031 --> 00:45:59,217
anything might happen, a world emergency. /59.2
一旦发生点什么, 都是世界级事件

132
00:45:59,331 --> 00:46:03,917
Suppose I had to order you to let me in there?
如果我不得不命令你让我进去呢？

133
00:46:04,113 --> 00:46:09,160
It wouldn't do any good. When the locks are switched over
they can only be opened from the inside.
那也没什么用, 一旦锁上了, 就只能从里面打开

134
00:46:57,472 --> 00:47:07,863
I have returned. Take radiation precautions.
I will make a report about the surface.
我回来了．小心辐射危险．我要准备一份关于地表的报告

135
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:09,570
He's back!
他回来了！

136
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:11,398
He's managed to get back again.
他历尽艰险又回来了fixme

137
00:47:11,516 --> 00:47:12,960
Let's hope he's got some good news this time.
期望这次他能带来些好消息

138
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:14,940
Do you think Salamander's found some more food, Swann?
你觉得 Salamander 找到了更多食物吗, Swann?

139
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,257
I hope so, otherwise we're finished.
Where's that stock list?
我期望是, 否则我们就完了．那张储物清单呢？

140
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:26,204
Welcome back, Salamander. Are you all right?
欢迎回来, Salamander ．你没事把？

141
00:47:26,382 --> 00:47:31,727
Don't, don't come too near my friend,
I am not yet decontaminated.
别, 别靠太近我的朋友．我还没消毒

141
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:34,727
I am too weary, totally weary.
我很疲惫, 完全累坏了

142
00:47:34,874 --> 00:47:37,434
You shouldn't have made this trip, Salamander,
you're doing too much.
你不应该来这一趟的, Salamander．你付出得太多了

143
00:47:37,585 --> 00:47:41,365
Someone has to bring back the food for you, my friend, huh? /41.3
必须得有个人给你们带食物回来, 我的朋友, 是吧？

143
00:47:43,015 --> 00:47:47,465
You know that the radiation is slowly killing me, don't you Swann?
你知道吗, 辐射正在慢慢地杀死我, 是不, Swann?

144
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,317
You're just doing too much.
你付出得太多了

145
00:47:49,457 --> 00:47:55,828
I worry about you all the time. What're you going to do
when I am no longer here?
我一直都担心你们．如果我不再出现在这里了你们该怎么办？

146
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:08,287
Radiation gets a little more each time, hm?
One day, that needle will stay at maximum radiation.
辐射一次比一次强了, 嗯？某一天那根针会一直指向最大辐射强度

147
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:09,246
Don't say that.
别那么说

148
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:14,204
Why Mary. Colin. Huh, it's my big joke, huh?
为什么？ Mary, Colin． 哈, 这是个大玩笑, 哈？

148
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:16,204
Just to frighten you a little.
只是为了吓唬你们一下

148
00:48:16,417 --> 00:48:18,204
I've got good news for us!
我有消息带给大家！

149
00:48:18,405 --> 00:48:19,227
We can return to the surface?
我们可以回到地面上去了？

150
00:48:19,336 --> 00:48:22,884
No no no not yet, but I've found another store of food...
不不不, 还不行, 但我找到了另外一个食物储藏点...

151
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:24,197
Thank goodness!
感谢老天！

152
00:48:24,323 --> 00:48:27,943
...it is undamaged. Colin, open the last store of wine, huh?
...保存完好．Colin, 打开最后那批酒吧, 哈?

152
00:48:28,023 --> 00:48:31,943
Go on, you help him too, Mary.
去吧, 你也帮帮他 Mary

153
00:48:34,007 --> 00:48:35,985
You must take it slowly for goodness sake.
你必须慢点, 老天

154
00:48:36,139 --> 00:48:40,962
I'm all right my friend. I'm just a little dizzy. It's... /41.0
我没事, 我的朋友．我只是有点头晕．这...

154
00:48:41,139 --> 00:48:47,962
It's terrible up there, you know, Swann, you've no idea. /48.0
上面情况很糟糕, 你知道吗, Swann, 你都想不到

154
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:50,762
Right, I am ready.
好了, 我准备好了

155
00:48:56,806 --> 00:48:59,214
But I still don't understand what's happened to Fariah.
但我还是没搞懂 Fariah 发生了什么

156
00:48:59,384 --> 00:49:01,127
She went the wrong way. We lost her.
她走错路了, 我们失去她了

157
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:03,256
Well we must find her!
You don't seem to realize how vital it is.
那我们必须找到她！你似乎没有意识到这有多关键

158
00:49:03,392 --> 00:49:05,187
Doctor, hold still a moment will you?
博士, 把住一会儿, 好吗？

Sorry.

There. Look at that, Giles, isn't it amazing?
那里．看那个, Giles, 是不是很惊人？

161
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:13,292
Salamander to the life.
fixme

00:49:13,705 --> 00:49:16,329
Yes, it's... it's not bad.
是的, 这个...这不错

163
00:49:16,513 --> 00:49:17,519
Shh, I think I heard something.

00:49:17,649 --> 00:49:19,080
Well perhaps it's Fariah.
