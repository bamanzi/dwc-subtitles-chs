No. Not about me. Fedorin.

Fedorin? A public embezzler
who commits suicide?

on a fool's errand, I hope?

64
00:39:07,374 --> 00:39:12,352
But I'm afraid this... this still isn't evidence,
it's... it's not real evidence.
但我担心这个...这个仍然不是证据, 它...不是真正的证据

65
00:39:12,445 --> 00:39:15,337
You mean even this doesn't convince you about Salamander?
你的意思是这个仍然不能说服你对 Salamander 的看法？

Oh, I'm not saying that.

而且当他们看见你跟我在一起, 他们肯定会相信你就是Salamander

But I... I still don't know if I can carry it off.

Of course, there are...

看看, 你给了我最大的机会, 让我能在这个怪物的世界里驰骋

or I'll have to do it another.
要么我可以说服你, 要么我就得另外想办法

Private justice, eh? Oh no, no.

Either you get rid of Salamander,

档案室现在禁止入内了．我不想被打扰

141
00:43:28,617 --> 00:43:30,390
See that the security locks are engaged.
确保安全锁已经锁上了

142
00:43:30,513 --> 00:43:32,502
Very well, sir. For how long, sir?
好的, 长官．锁多久, 长官？

143
00:43:32,606 --> 00:43:33,972
For as long as I say so.
我说多久就多久

144
00:43:34,082 --> 00:43:34,796
Yes sir.
好的, 长官

145
00:45:24,029 --> 00:45:27,385
It seems that Salamander's
locked himself away and can't be got at.
看起来 Salamander 把他自己锁起来了, 无法联系

146
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:28,262
So?
那?

147
00:45:28,406 --> 00:45:30,200
Well, suppose the place caught fire?
哦, 万一这个地方着火了呢？

148
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:31,220
It won't.
不会的

149
00:45:31,366 --> 00:45:32,193
Don't be foolish!
别犯傻！

150
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:35,498
Look, I can only tell you that
when Salamander works in records,
看, 我只能告诉你, 当 Salamander 在档案室里工作时

151
00:45:35,591 --> 00:45:38,598
as he does from time to time, no one is allowed in.
他经常这样的时候，不允许任何人进去

152
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:43,092
I can understand if it were a... laboratory...
要是这是一间...实验室, 我还能理解

153
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:45,292
or... a... research room of some sort, but a...
或者...一间研究室什么的 , 但是....

154
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:49,592
a records room? What sort of records
have you got in there anyway?
一间档案室? 你们那里面有什么样的档案?

155
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:50,499
What did you want to see him about?
你想见他做什么？

156
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:53,017
Never mind. I just don't like mysteries.
没什么, 我只是不喜欢这么神秘

157
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:56,217
Salamander's far too important
to lock himself away like this,
Salamander 太重要了, 不能这样把自己锁起来

158
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:59,317
anything might happen, a world emergency.

Suppose I had to order you to let me in there?
如果我不得不命令你让我进去呢？

160
00:46:04,213 --> 00:46:09,260
It wouldn't do any good. When the locks are switched over
they can only be opened from the inside.
那也没什么用, 一旦锁上了, 就只能从里面打开

161
00:46:57,872 --> 00:47:03,963
I have returned.
Take radiation precautions.

He's managed to get back again.
他终于又设法回来了

00:47:11,616 --> 00:47:13,280
Let's hope he's got some good news this time.

166
00:47:13,379 --> 00:47:15,240
Do you think Salamander's found some more food, Swann?
你觉得 Salamander 找到了更多食物了没, Swann?

167
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:19,057
I hope so, otherwise we're finished.
Where's that stock list?
我期望是, 否则我们就完了．那张储物清单呢？

00:47:23,659 --> 00:47:26,504
Welcome back, Salamander. Are you all right?
欢迎回来, Salamander ．你没事吧？

I am not yet decontaminated.

I am too weary, totally weary.

171
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:37,834
You shouldn't have made this trip, 
Salamander, you're doing too much.
你不应该来这一趟的, Salamander．你做得太多了

172
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:41,465
Someone has to bring back the food
for you, my friend, huh?
必须得有个人给你们带食物回来, 我的朋友, 是吧？

173
00:47:43,115 --> 00:47:47,865
You know that the radiation
is slowly killing me, don't you Swann?
你知道辐射正在慢慢地杀死我, 是不, Swann?

174
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,417
You're just doing too much.
你付出得太多了

175
00:47:49,557 --> 00:47:51,628
I worry about you all the time.
我一直都担心你们

176
00:47:53,057 --> 00:47:56,228
What're you going to do when I am no longer here?

Radiation gets a little more each time, hm?

One day, that needle will stay at maximum radiation.

179
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:13,846
- Don't say that.  - Why... Mary. Colin.
- 别那么说  - 为什么... Mary, Colin．

00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,084
Huh, it's my big joke, huh?
哈, 我开的玩笑有点大, 哈？

181
00:48:15,317 --> 00:48:17,004
Just to frighten you a little.
只是为了小小吓唬你们一下

182
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:18,904
I've got good news for us!
我有好消息带给大家！

183
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:19,927
We can return to the surface?
我们可以回到地面上去了？

184
00:48:20,036 --> 00:48:23,694
No no no not yet, but I've found another store of food...
不不不, 还不行, 但我找到了另外一个食物储藏点...

185
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:24,897
Thank goodness!
感谢老天！

00:48:25,023 --> 00:48:28,643

Go on, you help him too, Mary.
去吧, 你也帮帮他, Mary

You must take it slowly for goodness sake.
你必须慢点, 老天

I'm all right my friend. I'm just a little dizzy. It's...
我没事, 我的朋友．我只是有点头晕．只是...

190
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:48,662
It's terrible up there, you know, 
Swann, you've no idea.
上面情况太糟糕了, 你知道吗, Swann, 你都想不到

191
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,462
Right, I am ready.
好了, 我准备好了

192
00:48:57,506 --> 00:48:59,914
But I still don't understand what's happened to Fariah.
但我还是没搞懂 Fariah 发生了什么

193
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:01,827
She went the wrong way. We lost her.
她走错路了, 我们弄丢她了

Yes, it's... it's not bad.

Perhaps it's Fariah.
