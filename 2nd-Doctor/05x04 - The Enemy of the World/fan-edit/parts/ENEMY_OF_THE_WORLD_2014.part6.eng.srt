1
01:07:21,387 --> 01:07:24,003
He did it... down there...

2
01:07:31,803 --> 01:07:33,653
This is Salamander.

3
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:38,859
I want a security escort to come
to the interrogation room immediately.

4
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:45,299
I'm releasing two prisoners.
They are to be conducted to the main gates and set free.

5
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:49,659
Is that understood? Good.

6
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:53,454
- Well I hope that works.
- So do I.

7
01:07:53,513 --> 01:07:55,376
What do you want us to do when we get outside?

8
01:07:55,532 --> 01:07:57,204
There are plenty of public phones in the area.

9
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,904
Dial double zero one and ask for a man named Forrester.

10
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,222
- Eh?  - He's my deputy to this area.

11
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:04,514
Double zero one Forrester.

12
01:08:04,667 --> 01:08:07,299
Tell him where I am and just say "redhead".

13
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:08,137
Redhead.

14
01:08:08,262 --> 01:08:09,277
Redhead. Is that clear?

15
01:08:09,402 --> 01:08:11,136
Redhead? Is that your wife?

16
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:13,295
It's our emergency call.

17
01:08:13,442 --> 01:08:14,477
Sorry.

18
01:08:17,048 --> 01:08:23,599
Salamander... Is the, is the pass in order?

19
01:08:25,048 --> 01:08:28,299
Very well, you have my authority.

20
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:30,236
What's all that about?

21
01:08:30,758 --> 01:08:32,256
We have a visitor.

22
01:08:44,349 --> 01:08:48,102
Giles Kent. What are you doing here?

23
01:08:48,612 --> 01:08:50,870
Oh, I've been looking forward to this meeting.

24
01:08:50,972 --> 01:08:53,570
You're getting careless.
You didn't double lock the doors.

25
01:08:53,692 --> 01:08:55,950
Oh, its all right, I've done it now.

26
01:08:56,042 --> 01:09:00,270
The only way anybody can get through there
is to blast their way through.

27
01:09:00,435 --> 01:09:02,956
- How did you get into the Research Centre?
- Oh, you know me.

28
01:09:03,025 --> 01:09:06,859
There isn't a pass in the world
I can't get my hands on, if I put my mind to it.

29
01:09:06,953 --> 01:09:10,148
You won't find it so easy getting out.

30
01:09:10,339 --> 01:09:12,085
Really? Well we'll see.

31
01:09:12,339 --> 01:09:15,085
I'm not on my own this time.
I've got friends here with me.

32
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:18,185
And between us we're going to fix you once and for all.

33
01:09:18,378 --> 01:09:21,131
You always were a tiresome man, Kent.

34
01:09:21,292 --> 01:09:23,619
I'm going to be more than tiresome this time.

35
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,419
You know the biggest mistake you ever made...

36
01:09:25,512 --> 01:09:27,619
was not killing me when you had the chance.

37
01:09:28,059 --> 01:09:31,488
Oh so you going to kill me huh? How petty.

38
01:09:31,599 --> 01:09:33,188
What good do you think that will do?

39
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,818
Hold it! Now don't move quickly,

40
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:39,218
my nerves are a bit shaky at the moment.

41
01:09:39,616 --> 01:09:41,451
We must get in there somehow.

42
01:09:41,623 --> 01:09:43,909
We can't without the emergency key,
and Salamander has it in there.

43
01:09:44,065 --> 01:09:45,456
- We could burn our way in.  - Never.

44
01:09:45,554 --> 01:09:48,381
- Why not?
- It's an X-structure alloy, you'd hardly scratch the surface.

45
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:51,088
We'll have to try it. Get the gear up here. Fast!

46
01:09:51,702 --> 01:09:54,454
Ha ha ha. Never get away with it?
Oh, that's good, coming from you.

47
01:09:54,562 --> 01:09:56,754
Don't you realize you're dispensable,

48
01:09:56,862 --> 01:09:59,954
and the world is going to get along fine
without you from now on.

49
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:03,454
The only good idea you ever had in your life
was getting rid of me...

50
01:10:03,562 --> 01:10:05,854
and you couldn't even do that properly, could you?

51
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:08,354
Ha ha ha. And now I'm back and you're finished.

52
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,766
Oh, what's that?

53
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:14,104
They're breaking down the door.

54
01:10:18,374 --> 01:10:20,446
They don't appear to be having much success.

55
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:22,642
It's not cutting, sir.

56
01:10:22,732 --> 01:10:23,857
Never mind, keep at it.

57
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:25,625
You're trapped, aren't you?

58
01:10:25,863 --> 01:10:29,660
You're a fool, Salamander.
You don't think I'd forgotten already, do you?

59
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:31,175
What?

60
01:10:31,819 --> 01:10:34,300
I've been with you too many times in this room in the past,

61
01:10:34,419 --> 01:10:37,200
not to know where this leads to.

62
01:10:38,866 --> 01:10:40,445
Your little bolt-hole.

63
01:10:40,545 --> 01:10:43,445
Halfway down the tunnel.
A passage out to the fields...

64
01:10:43,566 --> 01:10:46,545
and enough explosives down there
to stop you or your thugs following me.

65
01:10:47,863 --> 01:10:52,932
Well that's very interesting Mister Kent.
Why didn't you tell me that before?

66
01:10:54,055 --> 01:10:57,298
- Oh no, it can't be.  - Oh, I'm afraid it is.

67
01:10:57,397 --> 01:11:00,838
Oh look. Here's another surprise for you. Look behind you.

68
01:11:01,158 --> 01:11:02,983
Astrid, you've come just in time.

69
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:05,842
It's too late, Giles, I know everything.

70
01:11:06,234 --> 01:11:09,062
That's him, that's the man
who took us down there in the first place.

71
01:11:09,238 --> 01:11:10,869
Giles Kent, we thought you were dead.

72
01:11:10,987 --> 01:11:13,139
Now look, I've never seen these people before in my life.

73
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:16,354
They told me everything.
You and Salamander were in it together...

74
01:11:17,173 --> 01:11:21,874
...You built an atomic shelter,
took some people down for an endurance test.

75
01:11:22,973 --> 01:11:24,874
The next person they saw was Salamander...

76
01:11:25,064 --> 01:11:27,950
...who told them that an atomic war had started.

77
01:11:28,132 --> 01:11:29,215
You see, Kent...

78
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:32,215
Oh, be careful, Doctor. He'll kill you.

79
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,933
You kept us down like animals.

80
01:11:34,111 --> 01:11:35,488
Why? Why did you do it to us?

81
01:11:35,767 --> 01:11:38,596
We had to have someone create
the natural disasters, didn't we,

82
01:11:38,767 --> 01:11:40,096
and we fooled you all!

83
01:11:40,278 --> 01:11:41,317
You didn't fool me, Kent...

84
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:42,710
You didn't suspect me.

85
01:11:42,909 --> 01:11:49,129
Any man who resorts to murder as eagerly
and as rapidly as you must be suspect.

86
01:11:49,259 --> 01:11:53,629
You didn't just want to expose Salamander,
you wanted to kill him and take his place.

87
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:55,612
And I will! Think you're going to stop me?
And these people?

88
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:59,712
Now move out of the way, quick!
We'll see who'll stop me!

89
01:11:59,984 --> 01:12:05,094
Stop him, Stop him!
He's going to try and blow the place up!

90
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:05,842
Come on then!

91
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:08,173
No! Don't touch that door, it's red hot.

92
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:09,497
What do you mean?

93
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,251
Well it's locked.
They're trying to burn through from the other side.

94
01:12:11,374 --> 01:12:12,188
Still no good, sir.

95
01:12:12,304 --> 01:12:13,557
Look! Salamander!

96
01:12:14,712 --> 01:12:17,758
Yes. I wonder if he knows Kent's on his way?

97
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,231
You always were a fool, weren't you?

98
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:36,330
Now wait a minute.
They'll be after both of us now.

99
01:12:36,516 --> 01:12:37,759
Oh no they won't.

100
01:12:37,912 --> 01:12:39,278
I tell you, they know!

101
01:12:39,859 --> 01:12:44,964
So what you want me to do, huh?
Bury our differences, hmm?

102
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:48,664
I didn't need you once, I still don't need you.

103
01:12:48,871 --> 01:12:50,985
Now wait a minute.
The place is mined, we know that.

104
01:12:51,071 --> 01:12:52,485
We planned it for years, together.

105
01:12:52,571 --> 01:12:56,185
Between us we can destroy them all, and the evidence.

106
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:58,185
Just you and me, Salamander.

107
01:12:58,788 --> 01:13:03,385
You and me? What use are you to me?

108
01:13:03,788 --> 01:13:07,385
You were useful once, but now...

109
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:09,981
No. No...

110
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:22,306
Ha ha ha ha. You won't get away
from me, Kent. Ha ha ha ha.

111
01:13:44,108 --> 01:13:48,806
Ha ha hah. I told you you could not escape me.

112
01:13:54,211 --> 01:14:00,785
Well if I'm going to die, Salamander,
you'll die with me.

113
01:14:01,903 --> 01:14:03,910
No! No!

114
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:10,379
Aaaaaaa!

115
01:14:19,193 --> 01:14:20,967
Come on Doctor,
we're going to get you out of here.

116
01:14:22,549 --> 01:14:25,985
Oh, look, Salamander, Giles, they're dead.

117
01:14:26,367 --> 01:14:27,859
We'll be dead too if we don't get out of here.

118
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:33,603
The people...

119
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:34,677
People. What people?

120
01:14:34,899 --> 01:14:37,105
The people underground in the deep shelter.

121
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:38,475
They may have been killed.

122
01:14:38,655 --> 01:14:40,390
I promised Swann I'd get them out.

123
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:42,225
But that's not your fault.
You couldn't have done more.

124
01:14:42,381 --> 01:14:45,601
There's a TV monitor screen in there.
There must be a link to the deep shelter.

125
01:14:54,942 --> 01:14:57,067
It's alright! They're alive!

126
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,405
How are you going to get to them?

127
01:14:58,596 --> 01:15:02,613
There's a tunnel from outside.
We can get to it outside the Research Station.

128
01:15:02,775 --> 01:15:04,830
But that's probably been destroyed by the explosion.

129
01:15:04,976 --> 01:15:06,867
We'll get to them somehow.

130
01:15:07,009 --> 01:15:07,869
Lookout!

131
01:15:10,769 --> 01:15:13,630
Get me some men. I'll lead them.

132
01:15:13,829 --> 01:15:15,308
Alright. I'll go with you.

133
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:17,626
Oh good then. That's splendid. I'll come too.

134
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:21,266
Oh no Doctor. It's far too dangerous.
They might mistake you as Salamander.

135
01:15:21,365 --> 01:15:22,979
Oh yes. Ooooh.

136
01:15:23,096 --> 01:15:24,948
- Are you hurt?  - Oh I'm alright.

137
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:28,998
I'll come with you as far as the gates.
Come along, we must go.

138
01:15:38,388 --> 01:15:39,785
I thought you were never coming.

139
01:15:43,801 --> 01:15:45,574
Hey Doctor, are you alright?

140
01:15:56,504 --> 01:16:01,539
Oh there you are Doctor.
You do look in a state. Come and sit down.

141
01:16:01,628 --> 01:16:04,131
I told you it wouldn't be long.
You, you worry too much.

142
01:16:04,368 --> 01:16:05,654
We shouldn't have left him.

143
01:16:05,732 --> 01:16:07,101
You see, after the explosion, Doctor,
we dinna know what to do.

144
01:16:07,232 --> 01:16:10,701
You said to come back here, which we did,
but I'm sure we were followed.

145
01:16:10,888 --> 01:16:13,497
Please, can we start straight away?

146
01:16:20,471 --> 01:16:26,894
Me, Doctor? But you said we were never to touch the controls.

147
01:16:27,737 --> 01:16:31,943
Quite right, Jamie. Welcome to the TARDIS.

148
01:16:32,283 --> 01:16:36,101
Thank you. You're doing so well impersonating me, ah,

149
01:16:36,283 --> 01:16:39,101
I thought I might return the compliment.

150
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:41,218
And Giles Kent?

151
01:16:41,544 --> 01:16:44,798
Unfortunately, didn't survive the explosion.

152
01:16:44,978 --> 01:16:46,486
We're going to put you outside, Salamander,

153
01:16:46,978 --> 01:16:49,486
no friends, no safety, nothing.

154
01:16:49,578 --> 01:16:53,586
You'll run, but they'll catch up with you.

155
01:16:53,669 --> 01:16:54,546
No!

156
01:16:58,773 --> 01:17:00,656
And now I'm going to kill you.

157
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:01,982
No you don't.

158
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,066
Oh, Doctor!

159
01:17:07,431 --> 01:17:11,558
Victoria! Jamie! Hold onto something!

160
01:17:12,038 --> 01:17:14,152
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

161
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:16,583
Jamie! Oh!

162
01:17:17,072 --> 01:17:18,805
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
