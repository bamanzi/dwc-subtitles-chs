1
01:07:21,387 --> 01:07:24,003
He did it... down there...

2
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:49,659
This is Salamander. I want a security escort to come to the interrogation room immediately. /38.9
I'm releasing two prisoners. They are to be conducted to the main gates and set free. /45.0
Is that understood? Good.

3
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:53,254
- Well I hope that works.
- So do I.

4
01:07:53,313 --> 01:07:55,376
What do you want us to do when we get outside?

5
01:07:55,532 --> 01:07:59,804
There are plenty of public phones in the area. Dial double zero one and ask for a man named Forrester.

6
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:00,525
Eh?

7
01:08:00,682 --> 01:08:02,222
He's my deputy to this area.

8
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:04,514
Double zero one Forrester.

9
01:08:04,667 --> 01:08:07,299
Tell him where I am and just say "redhead".

10
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:08,137
Redhead.

11
01:08:08,262 --> 01:08:09,277
Redhead. Is that clear?

12
01:08:09,402 --> 01:08:11,136
Redhead? Is that your wife?

13
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:13,295
It's our emergency call.

14
01:08:13,442 --> 01:08:14,477
Sorry.

15
01:08:17,048 --> 01:08:28,299
Salamander... Is the, is the pass in order?... Very well, you have my authority.

16
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:30,236
What's all that about?

17
01:08:30,758 --> 01:08:32,256
We have a visitor.

18
01:08:44,349 --> 01:08:48,102
Giles Kent. What are you doing here?

19
01:08:48,612 --> 01:09:00,270
Oh, I've been looking forward to this meeting. /50.9
You're getting careless. You didn't double lock the doors./53.6
Oh, its all right, I've done it now. /56.0
The only way anybody can get through there is to blast their way through.

20
01:09:00,435 --> 01:09:02,356
How did you get into the Research Centre?

21
01:09:02,525 --> 01:09:06,699
Oh, you know me. There isn't a pass in the world I can't get my hands on if I put my mind to it.

22
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:10,148
You won't find it so easy getting out.

23
01:09:10,339 --> 01:09:18,185
Really? Well we'll see. I'm not on my own this time. I've got friends here with me. /15.1
And between us we're going to fix you once and for all.

24
01:09:18,378 --> 01:09:21,131
You always were a tiresome man, Kent.

25
01:09:21,292 --> 01:09:27,619
I'm going to be more than tiresome this time. /23.6
You know the biggest mistake you ever made was not killing me when you had the chance.

26
01:09:28,059 --> 01:09:33,688
Oh so you going to kill me huh? How petty. What good do you think that will do?

27
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:39,218
Hold it! Now don't move quickly, my nerves are a bit shaky at the moment.

28
01:09:39,616 --> 01:09:41,451
We must get in there somehow.

29
01:09:41,623 --> 01:09:43,909
We can't without the emergency key, and Salamander has it in there.

30
01:09:44,065 --> 01:09:45,456
- We could burn our way in.
- Never.

31
01:09:45,554 --> 01:09:48,381
- Why not?
- It's an X-structure alloy, you'd hardly scratch the surface.

32
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:51,088
We'll have to try it. Get the gear up here. Fast!

33
01:09:51,702 --> 01:10:07,954
Ha ha ha. Never get away with it? Oh, that's good, coming from you.54.5
Don't you realize you're dispensable, and the world is going to get along fine without you from now on. /59.9
The only good idea you ever had in your life was getting rid of me /03.2
and you couldn't even do that properly, could you? Ha ha ha. And now  back and you're finished.

34
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,766
Oh, what's that?

35
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:14,104
They're breaking down the door.

36
01:10:18,374 --> 01:10:20,446
They don't appear to be having much success.

37
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:22,642
It's not cutting, sir.

38
01:10:22,732 --> 01:10:23,857
Never mind, keep at it.

39
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:25,625
You're trapped, aren't you?

40
01:10:25,863 --> 01:10:29,660
You're a fool, Salamander. You don't think I'd forgotten already, do you?

41
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:31,175
What?

42
01:10:31,819 --> 01:10:37,200
I've been with you too many times in this room in the past, not to know where this leads to.

43
01:10:38,866 --> 01:10:46,045
Your little bolt-hole. Halfway down the tunnel. /42.2
A passage out to the fields and enough explosives down there to stop you
or your thugs following me.

44
01:10:47,863 --> 01:10:52,632
Well that's very interesting Mister Kent. Why didn't you tell me that before?

45
01:10:54,055 --> 01:10:55,328
Oh no, it can't be.

46
01:10:55,497 --> 01:11:00,038
Oh, I'm afraid it is. Oh look. Here's another surprise for you. Look behind you.

47
01:11:01,158 --> 01:11:02,803
Astrid, you've come just in time.

48
01:11:02,973 --> 01:11:05,542
It's too late, Giles, I know everything.

49
01:11:06,334 --> 01:11:08,562
That's him, that's the man who took us down there in the first place.

50
01:11:08,738 --> 01:11:10,669
Giles Kent, we thought you were dead.

51
01:11:10,887 --> 01:11:12,839
Now look, I've never seen these people before in my life.

52
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:16,354
They told me everything. You and Salamander were in it together...

53
01:11:17,173 --> 01:11:24,874
...You built an atomic shelter, took some people down for an endurance test. The next person they saw was Salamander...

54
01:11:25,064 --> 01:11:27,950
...who told them that an atomic war had started.

55
01:11:28,132 --> 01:11:29,215
You see, Kent...

56
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:32,215
Oh, be careful, Doctor. He'll kill you.

57
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,933
You kept us down like animals.

58
01:11:34,111 --> 01:11:35,488
Why? Why did you do it to us?

59
01:11:35,767 --> 01:11:40,096
We had to have someone create the natural disasters, didn't we, and we fooled you all!

60
01:11:40,278 --> 01:11:41,317
You didn't fool me, Kent...

61
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:42,710
You didn't suspect me.

62
01:11:42,909 --> 01:11:53,629
Any man who resorts to murder as eagerly and as rapidly as you must be suspect. /49.1
You didn't just want to expose Salamander, you wanted to kill him and take his place.

63
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:59,712
And I will! Think you're going to stop me? And these people? /55.6
Now move out of the way, quick! We'll see who'll stop me!

64
01:11:59,814 --> 01:12:05,094
Huh, he's going to try and blow the place up!

65
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:05,842
Come on then!

66
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:08,173
No! Don't touch that door, it's red hot.

67
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:09,497
What do you mean?

68
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,651
Well it's locked. They're trying to burn through from the other side.

69
01:12:11,374 --> 01:12:12,188
Still no good, sir.

70
01:12:11,804 --> 01:12:13,557
Look! Salamander!

71
01:12:14,712 --> 01:12:17,758
Yes. I wonder if he knows Kent's on his way?

72
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,231
You always were a fool, weren't you?

73
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:36,330
Now wait a minute. They'll be after both of us now.

74
01:12:36,516 --> 01:12:37,759
Oh no they won't.

75
01:12:37,912 --> 01:12:39,278
I tell you, they know!

76
01:12:39,859 --> 01:12:48,664
So what you want me to do, huh? Bury our differences, hmm? /45.0
I didn't need you once, I still don't need you.

77
01:12:48,871 --> 01:12:58,185
Now wait a minute. The place is mined, we know that. We planned it for years, together. /52.5
Between us we can destroy them all, and the evidence. Just you and me, Salamander.

78
01:12:58,788 --> 01:13:07,385
You and me? What use are you to me? You were useful once, but now...

79
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:09,981
No. No...

80
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:22,306
Ha ha ha ha. You won't get away from me, Kent. Ha ha ha ha.

81
01:13:44,108 --> 01:13:48,806
Ha ha hah. I told you you could not escape me.

82
01:13:54,211 --> 01:14:00,785
Well if I'm going to die, Salamander, you'll die with me.

83
01:14:01,903 --> 01:14:03,910
No! No!

84
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:10,379
Aaaaaaa!

85
01:14:19,193 --> 01:14:20,467
Come on Doctor, let's get out of here.

86
01:14:23,949 --> 01:14:25,805
Salamander, Giles, they're dead.

87
01:14:26,367 --> 01:14:27,859
Come along man, quickly.

88
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:33,603
The people...

89
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:34,677
People. What people?

90
01:14:34,899 --> 01:14:37,105
The people underground in the deep shelter.

91
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:38,475
They may have been killed.

92
01:14:38,655 --> 01:14:40,390
I promised Swann I'd get them out.

93
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:42,225
But that's not your fault. You couldn't have done more.

94
01:14:42,381 --> 01:14:45,601
There's a TV monitor screen in there. There must be a link to the deep shelter.

95
01:14:54,942 --> 01:14:57,067
It's alright! They're alive!

96
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,405
How are you going to get to them?

97
01:14:58,596 --> 01:15:02,613
There's a tunnel from outside. We can get to it outside the Research Station.

98
01:15:02,775 --> 01:15:04,830
But that's probably been destroyed by the explosion.

99
01:15:04,976 --> 01:15:06,867
We'll get to them somehow.

100
01:15:07,009 --> 01:15:07,869
Lookout!

101
01:15:10,769 --> 01:15:13,630
Get me some men. I'll lead them.

102
01:15:13,829 --> 01:15:15,308
Alright. I'll go with you.

103
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:17,626
Oh good then. That's splendid. I'll come too.

104
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:21,266
Oh no Doctor. It's far too dangerous. They might mistake you as Salamander.

105
01:15:21,265 --> 01:15:22,979
Oh yes. Ooooh.

106
01:15:23,096 --> 01:15:24,948
- Are you hurt?
- Oh I'm alright.

107
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:28,998
 I'll come with you as far as the gates. Come along, we must go.

108
01:15:38,388 --> 01:15:39,785
I thought you were never coming.

109
01:15:43,801 --> 01:15:45,574
Hey Doctor, are you alright?

110
01:15:56,504 --> 01:16:01,539
Oh there you are Doctor. You do look in a state. Come and sit down.

111
01:16:01,628 --> 01:16:04,131
I told you it wouldn't be long. You, you worry too much.

112
01:16:04,368 --> 01:16:05,654
We shouldn't have left him.

113
01:16:05,832 --> 01:16:10,701
You see, after the explosion, Doctor, we dinna know what to do./07.1
You said to come back here, which we did, but I'm sure we were followed.

114
01:16:10,888 --> 01:16:13,497
Please, can we start straight away?

115
01:16:20,471 --> 01:16:26,894
Me, Doctor? But you said we were never to touch the controls.

116
01:16:27,737 --> 01:16:31,943
Quite right, Jamie. Welcome to the TARDIS.

117
01:16:32,283 --> 01:16:39,101
Thank you. You're doing so well impersonating me, ah, I thought I might return the compliment.

118
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:41,218
And Giles Kent?

119
01:16:41,544 --> 01:16:44,798
Unfortunately, didn't survive the explosion.

120
01:16:44,978 --> 01:16:53,586
We're going to put you outside, Salamander, no friends, no safety, nothing. /49.5
You'll run, but they'll catch up with you.

121
01:16:53,669 --> 01:16:54,546
No!

122
01:16:58,773 --> 01:17:00,656
And now I'm going to kill you.

123
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:01,982
No you don't.

124
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,066
Oh, Doctor!

125
01:17:07,431 --> 01:17:11,558
Victoria! Jamie! Hold onto something!

126
01:17:12,038 --> 01:17:14,152
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

127
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:16,583
Jamie! Oh!

128
01:17:17,072 --> 01:17:18,805
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
