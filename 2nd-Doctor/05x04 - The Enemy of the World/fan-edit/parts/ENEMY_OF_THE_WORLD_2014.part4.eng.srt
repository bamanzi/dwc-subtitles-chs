1
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:23,235
Patience, Mister Kent, patience.

2
00:36:23,336 --> 00:36:24,999
Astrid should have been in contact by now.

3
00:36:25,503 --> 00:36:26,505
Can't you contact her?

4
00:36:26,646 --> 00:36:28,516
If I knew where she was.

5
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:31,316
Oh no, I know she's in the Central European Zone,

6
00:36:31,446 --> 00:36:33,816
But that's a big place.
No, we'll just have to sweat it out and wait.

7
00:36:38,075 --> 00:36:41,902
Astrid, you're back. Switch to scramble.

8
00:36:42,057 --> 00:36:43,835
Scramble? Are we being monitored?

9
00:36:44,063 --> 00:36:46,328
- It's possible.  - Right. Switching now.

10
00:36:53,893 --> 00:36:54,807
Denes dead?

11
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:56,081
Yes, shot in the back.

12
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:59,445
Well, it looks as if our friend Salamander's
had a field day, doesn't it?

13
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,085
I'm afraid I haven't done very well.

14
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:05,032
Don't worry. It's not your fault.
Look, stay put and we'll join you.

15
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:09,695
The girl Astrid Ferrier,
she was in the Central European Zone.

16
00:37:09,872 --> 00:37:12,888
Was she? Well she's here now. Have you found her?

17
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:16,009
I think so. One of my men saw someone
answering her description...

18
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:17,609
...going into Giles Kent's office earlier.

19
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:18,583
Was she alone?

20
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,106
Yes, sir. But shortly after someone else followed her in.

21
00:37:21,693 --> 00:37:22,937
Well who, man, who?

22
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:25,513
Leader Salamander's food taster sir, Fariah.

23
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:28,306
Fariah?

24
00:37:28,894 --> 00:37:31,236
But what are they going to do to Jamie and Victoria?

25
00:37:31,393 --> 00:37:32,412
I don't know.

26
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:36,749
Hold them in the Central European zone
until Salamander has time to deal with them.

27
00:37:36,913 --> 00:37:39,826
No. You're wrong. Salamander doesn't care for loose ends.

28
00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:41,376
He brought them back with him.

29
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,933
What, to his headquarters, the Research Centre?

30
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:46,478
Yes. He's going to try to get information from them.

31
00:37:46,944 --> 00:37:48,585
How far will he go to get it?

32
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:50,066
Very far.

33
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:52,000
Oh, that's very comforting.

34
00:37:52,222 --> 00:37:54,412
I tell you I know Salamander.

35
00:37:54,678 --> 00:37:57,966
Yes, I... I'm not quite clear
about your part in all this.

36
00:37:58,078 --> 00:38:01,666
You work for Salamander, suddenly
you fall over yourselves to betray him.

37
00:38:02,139 --> 00:38:03,829
I came here for that purpose, yes.

38
00:38:04,002 --> 00:38:04,833
Why?

39
00:38:05,596 --> 00:38:08,568
Because I have every reason to hate Salamander.

40
00:38:08,696 --> 00:38:11,958
He blackmailed me into being his personal servant.

41
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:14,268
I even had to smile when he told me to.

42
00:38:14,477 --> 00:38:16,085
What sort of blackmail? What had you done?

43
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:18,955
- Does it really matter?
- Oh, no no no.

44
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:22,056
Of course not my dear.
Well nobody's perfect, Kent.

45
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:24,706
But I... I still can't help wondering why...

46
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,771
...why I hadn't tried to expose Salamander?

47
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:28,954
Well you were in a unique position to do so.

48
00:38:29,032 --> 00:38:31,458
Because without any proof
I'd be wasting my time.

49
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,560
Proof! Proof! Proof!
It always comes back to the same thing.

50
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,060
No one has any evidence against Salamander!

51
00:38:38,137 --> 00:38:38,918
We have some.

52
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:42,188
Not enough! It's not enough!
Salamander covers up too well.

53
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:43,399
I have what you want.

54
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:44,561
But I thought that you said...

55
00:38:44,695 --> 00:38:46,506
No. Not about me. Fedorin.

56
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:50,879
Fedorin? A public embezzler
who commits suicide?

57
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:54,929
Salamander engineered nearly every one
of those swindles, and I can prove it.

58
00:38:55,026 --> 00:38:55,673
How?

59
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,483
Fedorin's file.

60
00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:01,334
Is the building surrounded?

61
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:02,722
A three's in position, Captain.

62
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:03,830
Just closing up the gaps.

63
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,299
Well you haven't brought me here
on a fool's errand, I hope?

64
00:39:07,374 --> 00:39:12,352
But I'm afraid this... this still isn't evidence,
it's... it's not real evidence.

65
00:39:12,445 --> 00:39:15,337
You mean even this doesn't convince you about Salamander?

66
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,996
Oh, I'm not saying that.

67
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:19,695
Well then you'll do it? You'll impersonate him?

68
00:39:19,844 --> 00:39:22,870
And of course when they see you with me
they're bound to think you're Salamander.

69
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:27,009
But I... I still don't know if I can carry it off.

70
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:28,911
It's the only way to get your friends released.

71
00:39:29,084 --> 00:39:30,364
Yesss...

72
00:39:30,808 --> 00:39:32,015
Of course, there are...

73
00:39:32,145 --> 00:39:36,070
Oh I see, yes of course, there are conditions, aren't there?

74
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:38,620
You help me, I defeat Salamander?

75
00:39:38,722 --> 00:39:42,579
Now look, you're giving me the biggest opportunity
I'll ever have of ridding the world of this monster.

76
00:39:42,692 --> 00:39:45,579
Either I can convince you one way,
or I'll have to do it another.

77
00:39:45,697 --> 00:39:48,661
What you really want me to do is to kill him, isn't it?

78
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:50,994
What else do you do when someone is evil?

79
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:54,065
Private justice, eh? Oh no, no.

80
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:57,165
I'll expose him, ruin him, have him arrested,

81
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:59,605
But I won't be his executioner.
No one has that right.

82
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,951
Sometimes it's necessary.

83
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:02,660
- No.  - Yes, Doctor yes!

84
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:05,858
Right, we'll move in.

85
00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:08,060
Either you get rid of Salamander,

86
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:10,360
or we won't lift a finger to help your friends.

87
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:13,132
Mister Kent, look.

88
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:17,569
I'd make up my mind quickly if I were you.

89
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:19,559
- Why?  - Have a look out of the window.

90
00:40:19,786 --> 00:40:20,567
Well, what is it?

91
00:40:25,785 --> 00:40:27,571
What do we do now?

92
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:28,939
Over here, quick!

93
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:30,004
Well what's that?

94
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:32,086
- Through here, the ventilator shaft.
- The files.

95
00:40:32,235 --> 00:40:33,752
- Come on, quick.  - But where did it go?

96
00:40:34,143 --> 00:40:35,481
It doesn't matter, come on.

97
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,472
It's locked.

98
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:38,608
Now you, Doctor, next.

99
00:40:38,731 --> 00:40:40,019
- Oh what about you?
- Kent! Open the door

100
00:40:40,156 --> 00:40:41,807
Oh no, you're too important.
You go, and Giles.

101
00:40:42,037 --> 00:40:42,671
- I'll follow  - All right.

102
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:43,297
Very well...

103
00:40:43,395 --> 00:40:45,776
...you leave me no alternative. Break it down.

104
00:40:49,106 --> 00:40:49,799
Get back!

105
00:40:49,888 --> 00:40:50,960
Get away from that door!

106
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:01,667
Did you get the others?

107
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:03,126
Not yet, sir.

108
00:41:03,705 --> 00:41:10,403
Now listen to me. It was you,
Astrid Ferrier, Giles Kent...

109
00:41:10,505 --> 00:41:13,523
...and another. Who was the other man?

110
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:19,958
You'll know soon... soon enough.

111
00:41:20,276 --> 00:41:22,382
I want to know now.

112
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:24,347
Sir...

113
00:41:24,486 --> 00:41:27,425
Shut up! Well?

114
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:34,550
You can't threaten me now, Benik.

115
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:40,550
I can only die once,
and someone's beaten you to it.

116
00:41:41,393 --> 00:41:43,609
Who was the other man?

117
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:47,947
Sir?

118
00:41:49,152 --> 00:41:50,583
She's dead.

119
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:52,778
Good.

120
00:41:59,013 --> 00:42:03,369
Fedorin's file. Thank you.

121
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:10,557
What you mean is you failed.

122
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,455
I always said something should be done about Kent.

123
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:16,299
You always say. You say things, but you don't think.

124
00:42:16,463 --> 00:42:19,413
You exceeded your authority, Benik.
A woman's been killed.

125
00:42:19,563 --> 00:42:20,185
Resisting arrest.

126
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:23,411
Maybe. But you can't just take the law into your own hands.

127
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:25,411
Giles Kent hadn't broken any rules that I know of.

128
00:42:25,602 --> 00:42:29,131
For sure he'd show himself one day,
he was simply building up his resistance group.

129
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:35,114
Resistance group! The man's a traitor.
These people are rebels.

130
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:41,611
Bruce, you must find this man who impersonated me.
The dangers are obvious.

131
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:45,254
He could walk in anywhere at any time
pretending to be me and ruin everything.

132
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:46,113
You can leave that to me.

133
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:47,071
How so?

134
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:51,272
Benik, come with me and I'll go over
the security arrangements with you now.

135
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:55,213
Do as you're told!

136
00:42:57,084 --> 00:42:59,521
I think you'll find this interesting.

137
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:06,693
What? The girl Fariah had this?

138
00:43:10,034 --> 00:43:11,693
What can I say?

139
00:43:23,024 --> 00:43:23,981
Yes sir?

140
00:43:24,317 --> 00:43:28,490
The records room is out of bounds.
I am not to be disturbed.

141
00:43:28,617 --> 00:43:30,390
See that the security locks are engaged.

142
00:43:30,513 --> 00:43:32,502
Very well, sir. For how long, sir?

143
00:43:32,606 --> 00:43:33,972
For as long as I say so.

144
00:43:34,082 --> 00:43:34,796
Yes sir.

145
00:45:24,029 --> 00:45:27,385
It seems that Salamander's
locked himself away and can't be got at.

146
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:28,262
So?

147
00:45:28,406 --> 00:45:30,200
Well, suppose the place caught fire?

148
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:31,220
It won't.

149
00:45:31,366 --> 00:45:32,193
Don't be foolish!

150
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:35,498
Look, I can only tell you that
when Salamander works in records,

151
00:45:35,591 --> 00:45:38,598
as he does from time to time, no one is allowed in.

152
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:43,092
I can understand if it were a... laboratory...

153
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:45,292
or... a... research room of some sort, but a...

154
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:49,592
a records room? What sort of records
have you got in there anyway?

155
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:50,499
What did you want to see him about?

156
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:53,017
Never mind. I just don't like mysteries.

157
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:56,217
Salamander's far too important
to lock himself away like this,

158
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:59,317
anything might happen, a world emergency.

159
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:04,017
Suppose I had to order you to let me in there?

160
00:46:04,213 --> 00:46:09,260
It wouldn't do any good. When the locks are switched over
they can only be opened from the inside.

161
00:46:57,872 --> 00:47:03,963
I have returned.
Take radiation precautions.

162
00:47:04,172 --> 00:47:07,963
I will make a report about the surface.

163
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,670
He's back!

164
00:47:09,867 --> 00:47:11,498
He's managed to get back again.

165
00:47:11,616 --> 00:47:13,280
Let's hope he's got some good news this time.

166
00:47:13,379 --> 00:47:15,240
Do you think Salamander's found some more food, Swann?

167
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:19,057
I hope so, otherwise we're finished.
Where's that stock list?

168
00:47:23,659 --> 00:47:26,504
Welcome back, Salamander. Are you all right?

169
00:47:26,582 --> 00:47:31,827
Don't, don't come too near my friend,
I am not yet decontaminated.

170
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,827
I am too weary, totally weary.

171
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:37,834
You shouldn't have made this trip,
Salamander, you're doing too much.

172
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:41,465
Someone has to bring back the food
for you, my friend, huh?

173
00:47:43,115 --> 00:47:47,865
You know that the radiation
is slowly killing me, don't you Swann?

174
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,417
You're just doing too much.

175
00:47:49,557 --> 00:47:51,628
I worry about you all the time.

176
00:47:53,057 --> 00:47:56,228
What're you going to do when I am no longer here?

177
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:04,087
Radiation gets a little more each time, hm?

178
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,887
One day, that needle will stay at maximum radiation.

179
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:13,846
- Don't say that.  - Why... Mary. Colin.

180
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,084
Huh, it's my big joke, huh?

181
00:48:15,317 --> 00:48:17,004
Just to frighten you a little.

182
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:18,904
I've got good news for us!

183
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:19,927
We can return to the surface?

184
00:48:20,036 --> 00:48:23,694
No no no not yet, but I've found another store of food...

185
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:24,897
Thank goodness!

186
00:48:25,023 --> 00:48:28,643
...And it is undamaged.
Colin, open the last store of wine, huh?

187
00:48:28,723 --> 00:48:32,643
Go on, you help him too, Mary.

188
00:48:34,707 --> 00:48:36,685
You must take it slowly for goodness sake.

189
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:41,662
I'm all right my friend. I'm just a little dizzy. It's...

190
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:48,662
It's terrible up there, you know,
Swann, you've no idea.

191
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,462
Right, I am ready.

192
00:48:57,506 --> 00:48:59,914
But I still don't understand what's happened to Fariah.

193
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:01,827
She went the wrong way. We lost her.

194
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:03,956
Well we must find her!
You don't seem to realize how vital it is.

195
00:49:04,092 --> 00:49:05,887
Doctor, hold still a moment will you?

196
00:49:06,001 --> 00:49:06,800
Sorry.

197
00:49:08,037 --> 00:49:12,588
There. Look at that, Giles, isn't it amazing?

198
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:13,992
Salamander to the life.

199
00:49:14,405 --> 00:49:17,029
Yes, it's... it's not bad.

200
00:49:17,213 --> 00:49:18,219
Shh, I think I heard something.

201
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:19,780
Perhaps it's Fariah.

202
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:27,589
Stay where you are. I've been looking forward
to meeting you again.
