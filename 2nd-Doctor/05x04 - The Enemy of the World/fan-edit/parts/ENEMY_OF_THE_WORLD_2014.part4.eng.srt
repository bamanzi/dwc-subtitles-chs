1
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:22,295
Patience, Mister Kent, patience.

2
00:36:23,186 --> 00:36:24,799
Astrid should have been in contact by now.

3
00:36:25,503 --> 00:36:26,505
Can't you contact her?

4
00:36:26,646 --> 00:36:33,616
If I knew where she was. Oh no, I know she's in the Central European Zone, 
but that's a big place. No, we'll just have to sweat it out and wait.

5
00:36:38,075 --> 00:36:41,772
Astrid, you're back. Switch to scramble.

6
00:36:41,977 --> 00:36:43,835
Scramble? Are we being monitored?

7
00:36:44,063 --> 00:36:46,328
Right. Switching now.

8
00:36:53,893 --> 00:36:54,807
Denes dead?

9
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:56,081
Yes, shot in the back.

10
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:59,445
Well, it looks as if our friend Salamander's had a field day, doesn't it?

11
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,085
I'm afraid I haven't done very well.

12
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:05,032
Don't worry. It's not your fault. Look, stay put and we'll join you.

13
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:09,695
The girl Astrid Ferrier, she was in the Central European Zone.

14
00:37:09,872 --> 00:37:12,888
Was she? Well she's here now. Have you found her?

15
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:17,609
I think so. One of my men saw someone answering her description going into Giles Kent's office earlier.

16
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:18,583
Was she alone?

17
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,106
Yes, sir. But shortly after someone else followed her in.

18
00:37:21,693 --> 00:37:22,937
Well who, man, who?

19
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:25,513
Leader Salamander's food taster sir, Fariah.

20
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:28,306
Fariah? 

21
00:37:28,894 --> 00:37:31,236
But what are they going to do to Jamie and Victoria?

22
00:37:31,393 --> 00:37:32,412
I don't know.

23
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:36,749
Hold them in the Central European zone until Salamander has time to deal with them.

24
00:37:36,913 --> 00:37:41,276
No. You're wrong. Salamander doesn't care for loose ends. He brought them back with him.

25
00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:43,833
What, to his headquarters, the Research Centre?

26
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:46,378
Yes. He's going to try to get information from them.

27
00:37:46,844 --> 00:37:48,485
How far will he go to get it?

28
00:37:48,717 --> 00:37:49,966
Very far.

29
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:51,900
Oh, that's very comforting.

30
00:37:52,122 --> 00:37:54,312
I tell you I know Salamander.

31
00:37:54,578 --> 00:38:01,566
Yes, I... I'm not quite clear about your part in all this. /57.9
You work for Salamander, suddenly you fall over yourselves to betray him.

32
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,729
I came here for that purpose, yes.

33
00:38:03,902 --> 00:38:04,733
Why?

34
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:14,168
Because I have every reason to hate Salamander. /08.5
He blackmailed me into being his personal servant. /11.5
I even had to smile when he told me to.

35
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:15,985
What sort of blackmail? What had you done?

36
00:38:16,324 --> 00:38:17,595
Does it really matter?

37
00:38:17,764 --> 00:38:24,456
Oh, no no no of course not my dear. 
Well nobody's perfect, Kent./22.0
But I... I still can't help wondering why...

38
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:26,471
...why I hadn't tried to expose Salamander?

39
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:28,654
Well you were in a unique position to do so.

40
00:38:28,832 --> 00:38:31,358
Because without any proof I'd be wasting my time.

41
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:37,860
Proof! Proof! Proof! It always comes back to the same thing. /35.4
No one has any evidence against Salamander!

42
00:38:38,037 --> 00:38:38,818
We have some.

43
00:38:38,955 --> 00:38:42,088
Not enough! It's not enough! Salamander covers up too well.

44
00:38:42,254 --> 00:38:43,299
I have what you want.

45
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:44,461
But I thought that you said...

46
00:38:44,595 --> 00:38:46,206
No. Not about me. Fedorin.

47
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:50,779
Fedorin? A public embezzler who commits suicide?

48
00:38:50,974 --> 00:38:54,629
Salamander engineered nearly every one of those swindles, and I can prove it.

49
00:38:54,796 --> 00:38:55,573
How?

50
00:38:58,153 --> 00:38:59,383
Fedorin's file.

51
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:01,234
Is the building surrounded?

52
00:39:01,336 --> 00:39:02,622
A-three's in position, Captain.

53
00:39:02,748 --> 00:39:03,730
Just closing up the gaps.

54
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,199
Well you haven't brought me here on a fool's errand, I hope?

55
00:39:07,274 --> 00:39:12,252
But I'm afraid this... this still isn't evidence, it's... it's not real evidence.

56
00:39:12,345 --> 00:39:15,237
You mean even this doesn't convince you about Salamander?

57
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,896
Oh, I'm not saying that.

58
00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:19,595
Well then you'll do it? You'll impersonate him?

59
00:39:19,744 --> 00:39:22,770
And of course when they see you with me they're bound to think you're Salamander.

60
00:39:23,024 --> 00:39:26,909
But I... I still don't know if I can carry it off.

61
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:28,811
It's the only way to get your friends released.

62
00:39:28,984 --> 00:39:30,264
Yesss...

63
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:31,915
Of course, there are...

64
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:38,170
Oh I see, yes of course, there are conditions, aren't there? /36.0
You help me, I defeat Salamander?

65
00:39:38,322 --> 00:39:45,179
Now look, you're giving me the biggest opportunity 
I'll ever have of ridding the world of this monster./42.5
Either I can convince you one way, or I'll have to do it another.

66
00:39:45,397 --> 00:39:48,561
What you really want me to do is to kill him, isn't it?

67
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:50,494
What else do you do when someone is evil?

68
00:39:51,072 --> 00:39:59,265
Private justice, eh? Oh no, no. /54.0
I'll expose him, ruin him, have him arrested, 
but I won't be his executioner. /58.1
No one has that right.

69
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,651
Sometimes it's necessary.

70
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:02,360
- No.
- Yes, Doctor yes!

71
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:05,758
Right, we'll move in.

72
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:10,260
Either you get rid of Salamander,
or we won't lift a finger to help your friends.

73
00:40:10,376 --> 00:40:13,032
Mister Kent, look.

74
00:40:15,463 --> 00:40:17,469
I'd make up my mind quickly if I were you.

75
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,459
- Why?
- Have a look out of the window.

76
00:40:19,686 --> 00:40:20,467
Well, what is it?

77
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:27,471
What do we do now?

78
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:28,839
Over here, quick!

79
00:40:29,037 --> 00:40:29,904
Well what's that?

80
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,986
- Through here, the ventilator shaft.
- The files.

81
00:40:32,135 --> 00:40:33,652
- Come on, quick.
- But where did it go?

82
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:35,381
It doesn't matter, come on.

83
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,372
It's locked.

84
00:40:37,486 --> 00:40:38,508
Now you, Doctor, next.

85
00:40:38,631 --> 00:40:39,919
- Oh what about you?
- Kent! Open the door

86
00:40:40,056 --> 00:40:41,707
Oh no, you're too important. You go, and Giles.

87
00:40:41,937 --> 00:40:42,571
- I'll follow
- All right.

88
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:43,177
Very well...

89
00:40:43,295 --> 00:40:45,676
...you leave me no alternative. Break it down.

90
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:49,619
Get back!

91
00:40:49,788 --> 00:40:50,860
Get away from that door!

92
00:41:00,605 --> 00:41:01,567
Did you get the others?

93
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:03,026
Not yet, sir.

94
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:13,423
Now listen to me. It was you, Astrid Ferrier, Giles Kent and another. Who was the other man?

95
00:41:14,382 --> 00:41:19,698
You'll know soon... soon enough.

96
00:41:20,176 --> 00:41:21,982
I want to know now.

97
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:23,947
Sir...

98
00:41:24,386 --> 00:41:27,325
Shut up! Well?

99
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:40,450
You can't threaten me now, Benik. I can only die once. And someone's beaten you to it.

100
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:43,509
Who was the other man?

101
00:41:46,582 --> 00:41:47,547
Sir?

102
00:41:49,052 --> 00:41:50,483
She's dead.

103
00:41:51,229 --> 00:41:52,678
Good.

104
00:41:58,913 --> 00:42:03,269
Fedorin's file. Thank you.

105
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:10,457
What you mean is you failed.

106
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,355
I always said something should be done about Kent.

107
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:16,199
You always say. You say things, but you don't think.

108
00:42:16,363 --> 00:42:19,313
You exceeded your authority, Benik. A woman's been killed.

109
00:42:19,463 --> 00:42:20,085
Resisting arrest.

110
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:25,311
Maybe. But you can't just take the law into your own hands. Giles Kent hadn't broken any rules that I know of.

111
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:29,031
For sure he'd show himself one day, he was simply building up his resistance group.

112
00:42:29,201 --> 00:42:45,014
Resistance group! The man's a traitor. These people are rebels./35.0
Bruce, you must find this man who impersonated me. The dangers are obvious. /41.3
He could walk in anywhere at any time pretending to be me and ruin everything.

113
00:42:45,257 --> 00:42:46,013
You can leave that to me.

114
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:46,971
How so?

115
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:50,972
Benik, come with me and I'll go over the security arrangements with you now.

116
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:55,113
Do as you're told!

117
00:42:56,884 --> 00:42:59,421
I think you'll find this interesting.

118
00:43:03,365 --> 00:43:11,593
What? The girl Fariah had this? What can I say?

119
00:43:22,924 --> 00:43:23,881
Yes sir?

120
00:43:24,217 --> 00:43:30,090
The records room is out of bounds. I am not to be disturbed. /28.3
See that the security locks are engaged.

121
00:43:30,413 --> 00:43:32,262
Very well, sir. For how long, sir?

122
00:43:32,436 --> 00:43:33,722
For as long as I say so.

123
00:43:33,882 --> 00:43:34,526
Yes sir.

124
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,285
It seems that Salamander's locked himself away and can't be got at.

125
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:28,162
So?

126
00:45:28,306 --> 00:45:30,100
Well, suppose the place caught fire?

127
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:31,120
It won't.

128
00:45:31,266 --> 00:45:32,093
Don't be foolish!

129
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:38,498
Look, I can only tell you that when Salamander works in records, as he does from time to time, no one is allowed in.

130
00:45:38,658 --> 00:45:49,192
I can understand if it were a... er... a... laboratory or... a... research room of some sort, but a... /45.2
a records room? What sort of records have you got in there anyway?

131
00:45:49,335 --> 00:45:50,399
What did you want to see him about?

132
00:45:50,531 --> 00:46:03,917
Never mind. I just don't like mysteries. /52.9
Salamander's far too important to lock himself away like this,
anything might happen, a world emergency. /59.2
Suppose I had to order you to let me in there?

133
00:46:04,113 --> 00:46:09,160
It wouldn't do any good. When the locks are switched over they can only be opened from the inside.

134
00:46:57,472 --> 00:47:07,863
I have returned. Take radiation precautions. I will make a report about the surface.

135
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:09,570
He's back!

136
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:11,398
He's managed to get back again.

137
00:47:11,516 --> 00:47:12,960
Let's hope he's got some good news this time.

138
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:14,940
Do you think Salamander's found some more food, Swann?

139
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,257
I hope so, otherwise we're finished. Where's that stock list?

140
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:26,204
Welcome back, Salamander. Are you all right?

141
00:47:26,382 --> 00:47:34,727
Don't, don't come too near my friend, I am not yet decontaminated. I am too weary, totally weary.

142
00:47:34,874 --> 00:47:37,434
You shouldn't have made this trip, Salamander, you're doing too much.

143
00:47:37,585 --> 00:47:47,465
Someone has to bring back the food for you, my friend, huh? /41.3
/43.0You know that the radiation is slowly killing me, don't you Swann?

144
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,317
You're just doing too much.

145
00:47:49,457 --> 00:47:55,828
I worry about you all the time. What're you going to do when I am no longer here?

146
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:08,287
Radiation gets a little more each time, hm? One day, that needle will stay at maximum radiation.

147
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:09,246
Don't say that.

148
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:18,204
Why Mary. Colin. Huh, it's my big joke, huh? Just to frighten you a little. I've got good news for us!

149
00:48:18,405 --> 00:48:19,227
We can return to the surface?

150
00:48:19,336 --> 00:48:22,884
No no no not yet, but I've found another store of food...

151
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:24,197
Thank goodness!

152
00:48:24,323 --> 00:48:31,943
...it is undamaged. Colin, open the last store of wine, huh? Go on, you help him too, Mary.

153
00:48:34,007 --> 00:48:35,985
You must take it slowly for goodness sake.

154
00:48:36,139 --> 00:48:50,762
I'm all right my friend. I'm just a little dizzy. It's... /41.0
it's terrible up there, you know, Swann, you've no idea. /48.0
Right, I am ready.

155
00:48:56,806 --> 00:48:59,214
But I still don't understand what's happened to Fariah.

156
00:48:59,384 --> 00:49:01,127
She went the wrong way. We lost her.

157
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:03,256
Well we must find her! You don't seem to realize how vital it is.

158
00:49:03,392 --> 00:49:05,187
Doctor, hold still a moment will you?

159
00:49:05,301 --> 00:49:06,100
Sorry.

160
00:49:07,337 --> 00:49:11,888
There. Look at that, Giles, isn't it amazing?

161
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:13,292
Salamander to the life.

162
00:49:13,705 --> 00:49:16,329
Yes, it's... it's not bad.
