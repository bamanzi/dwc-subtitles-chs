1
00:49:27,813 --> 00:49:31,455
Over there... No, not you.

2
00:49:33,913 --> 00:49:36,855
Sit down, all of you.

3
00:49:37,154 --> 00:49:39,873
Incredible. You fooled me the first time we met,

4
00:49:39,994 --> 00:49:44,223
but now, even Salamander himself
would think he was looking in a mirror.

5
00:49:44,254 --> 00:49:49,123
Why? You want this man to impersonate Salamander, why?

6
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:52,423
How much are they paying you?

7
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:53,503
I beg your pardon?

8
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:56,220
They want you to assassinate Salamander,
don't they? Take his place?

9
00:49:57,072 --> 00:49:58,820
That's ridiculous! I couldn't possibly do that.

10
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,179
But you were preparing to impersonate him, weren't you?

11
00:50:01,392 --> 00:50:02,178
Well well, yes.

12
00:50:02,326 --> 00:50:03,946
Alright then, why?

13
00:50:04,122 --> 00:50:08,704
Because Salamander holds my two friends prisoner
and I was going to attempt to rescue them.

14
00:50:08,966 --> 00:50:13,861
And at the same time get evidence
that would expose Salamander...

15
00:50:13,966 --> 00:50:17,461
...as a traitor, blackmailer and murderer!

16
00:50:17,657 --> 00:50:20,306
Quite an ambitious plan.
How do you know such evidence exists?

17
00:50:20,478 --> 00:50:21,719
It exists in Salamander's records.

18
00:50:21,908 --> 00:50:24,365
Oh, yes, I know why you want Salamander out of the way.

19
00:50:24,478 --> 00:50:30,365
You hate him because he exposed
your profitable sideline of misusing public money.

20
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,958
Oh, it was Salamander who was misusing the money.

21
00:50:33,107 --> 00:50:36,334
And I was dismissed from my post and
the evidence against Salamander concealed.

22
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,129
So you say. But you've no evidence at all
against Salamander, have you?

23
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,485
I tell you the evidence is in Salamander's records.

24
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:44,462
And I'm expected to take that from you?

25
00:50:44,578 --> 00:50:46,935
We do hold evidence...

26
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:50,306
that Salamander isn't quite
so pure and white as he's painted.

27
00:50:50,498 --> 00:50:51,839
No? What?

28
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:55,599
A file, containing certain information
about a gentleman called Fedorin.

29
00:50:56,164 --> 00:51:00,085
Salamander was going to
use this evidence against Fedorin.

30
00:51:00,164 --> 00:51:04,585
Blackmail him into submission.
after he'd got rid of Denes, that is.

31
00:51:04,826 --> 00:51:06,768
And so gain control of another zone.

32
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,148
Where is this file?

33
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:10,851
Fariah has it, Salamander's food taster.

34
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:14,340
Fariah? But she's dead.

35
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:17,715
Dead? But how?

36
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:20,111
She was shot by one of Benik's guards, escaping arrest.

37
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:24,513
Escaping arrest? Benik had her killed,

38
00:51:24,616 --> 00:51:26,613
because she had evidence against Salamander.

39
00:51:26,723 --> 00:51:29,398
And Benik will return the file to Salamander.

40
00:51:29,493 --> 00:51:31,198
We must get to the Research Station.

41
00:51:31,285 --> 00:51:32,534
You're not going anywhere or doing anything.

42
00:51:32,685 --> 00:51:35,634
As far as I'm concerned, this story you've told me
could be a pack of lies...

43
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:38,334
to cover your attempt to assassinate Salamander.

44
00:51:38,485 --> 00:51:43,334
Now I'm not saying I'm altogether satisfied with
Salamander or his organisation,

45
00:51:43,455 --> 00:51:45,634
but I'll investigate in my own way.

46
00:51:45,889 --> 00:51:49,059
Meanwhile Salamander will have found a way to cover himself,

47
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,699
and also a way of disposing of you.
You're digging your own grave, Bruce.

48
00:51:52,907 --> 00:51:55,964
That's my affair. And I do things my own way.

49
00:51:56,982 --> 00:51:59,594
And I do things my way.

50
00:52:00,054 --> 00:52:04,197
Really, as Head of Security,
you should have more reliable guards.

51
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:09,350
- Leader Salamander?
- Still inside, sir.

52
00:52:09,453 --> 00:52:10,901
Let me know the moment the doors are opened.

53
00:52:11,035 --> 00:52:11,655
Yes sir.

54
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:23,841
So you've brought them?
Good. Any trouble?

55
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,865
No, a light drug saw to that.

56
00:52:26,066 --> 00:52:27,560
Let me know the moment they wake up.

57
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:28,631
Yes sir.

58
00:52:29,044 --> 00:52:33,870
I'm looking forward to questioning them.
I have the feeling they're going to be stubborn.

59
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,870
So much more interesting when our prisoners are stubborn.

60
00:52:41,706 --> 00:52:45,748
You're only making trouble for yourself.
Killing me won't get you anywhere.

61
00:52:45,837 --> 00:52:49,951
We have to get to the Research Station,
and you're not going to stop us.

62
00:52:50,055 --> 00:52:51,693
But you're completely surrounded.

63
00:52:51,805 --> 00:52:54,893
You don't really believe I came here
with just one guard, do you?

64
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,393
You'd be very silly to try and fight your way out.

65
00:52:58,505 --> 00:53:02,253
I'd give you about... thirty seconds to live if you try.

66
00:53:02,356 --> 00:53:04,338
Alright Bruce, we might have just thirty seconds

67
00:53:04,406 --> 00:53:06,338
but you'd have exactly half that time, if you were lucky!

68
00:53:06,534 --> 00:53:09,261
Please, Mister Kent!
You're forgetting one very important thing.

69
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,516
- What?  - Me.

70
00:53:10,696 --> 00:53:13,956
Without me you haven't got an earthly chance
of getting in that control centre.

71
00:53:14,047 --> 00:53:14,781
So?

72
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:18,178
I told you before,
I will not have anything to do with violence!

73
00:53:18,444 --> 00:53:19,537
And what about your two friends?

74
00:53:19,644 --> 00:53:21,737
Are you going to leave them
to the tender mercies of Salamander?

75
00:53:21,843 --> 00:53:25,224
No I am not. May I?

76
00:53:25,412 --> 00:53:28,292
- What?  - Please? Just trust me.

77
00:53:28,769 --> 00:53:34,088
Now then, I think you agree that
at this moment your life is in my hands.

78
00:53:37,961 --> 00:53:38,954
What are you doing?

79
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:39,941
Hold it.

80
00:53:40,127 --> 00:53:43,056
It's alright, Mister Bruce isn't going
to shoot anyone, are you?

81
00:53:43,283 --> 00:53:46,068
Why? Why'd you do that?

82
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:49,810
Because I think I know what sort of man you are
- honest and reasonable.

83
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:51,376
Go on.

84
00:53:51,682 --> 00:53:55,817
I gave you back that gun because I trust you.
Now I want you to trust me.

85
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:59,416
You must be a complete fool, or very clever.

86
00:53:59,685 --> 00:54:03,136
Well I'm afraid you will have to
make up your mind to that right away.

87
00:54:03,348 --> 00:54:05,686
What do you hope to gain from this gesture?

88
00:54:05,979 --> 00:54:07,236
Your confidence.

89
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,962
Do you believe Kent's accusations against Salamander?

90
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:15,339
I think there's reasonable doubt about
Salamander's personal integrity,

91
00:54:15,439 --> 00:54:16,339
but there's only one way to get proof.

92
00:54:16,433 --> 00:54:18,427
By getting into Salamander's Research Station?

93
00:54:18,681 --> 00:54:22,035
Yes. And my two young friends may have some information.

94
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,691
And if there isn't any evidence?

95
00:54:24,952 --> 00:54:28,950
Then you'll be perfectly free to arrest us
and put us in prison, won't you?

96
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:33,249
Alright, I'll do it, on one condition.

97
00:54:33,695 --> 00:54:34,401
And what's that?

98
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:36,961
That you and I go alone,
Kent and the girl stay here as hostages.

99
00:54:37,134 --> 00:54:38,290
No wait a minute, I must go with him.

100
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:43,609
No, Kent, you stay here.
I must be mad to trust you.

101
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,609
I only hope your impersonation of Salamander fools Benik.

102
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:49,009
If it doesn't, we're in dead trouble.

103
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:53,709
Here, take this. Keep those two in the caravan.

104
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:58,709
Oh, and, um, watch the girl. Come on.

105
00:55:06,314 --> 00:55:12,820
Ah, how we getting on here, huh?
Ah, all this? That's a good haul.

106
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:16,684
Stand by to make your report, Swann.

107
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:32,016
Reaching full power here, Swann.

108
00:55:43,525 --> 00:55:45,364
Salamander, I must see you.

109
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:48,165
Not now, we are too busy.

110
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:49,321
This is urgent.

111
00:55:52,009 --> 00:55:53,196
Oh very well.

112
00:56:01,702 --> 00:56:02,894
Now what's the matter, huh?

113
00:56:02,994 --> 00:56:04,366
What's this? What is this?

114
00:56:04,596 --> 00:56:05,255
What?

115
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:07,151
Newspaper. It's a piece of newspaper.

116
00:56:08,766 --> 00:56:09,743
So?

117
00:56:09,943 --> 00:56:13,995
Well go on, look at it. Read it. Last year's date.

118
00:56:14,143 --> 00:56:15,995
Look at the bit of headline there. THERE!

119
00:56:16,076 --> 00:56:17,661
Control yourself, Swann. You'll go mad.

120
00:56:17,724 --> 00:56:20,521
"Holiday Liner Sinks"!

121
00:56:20,724 --> 00:56:24,021
You say there's a global war. Radiation everywhere.

122
00:56:24,124 --> 00:56:28,421
How can there be holiday liners? Tell me how!

123
00:56:28,624 --> 00:56:33,421
You've lied to us, haven't you? HAVEN'T YOU?

124
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:45,737
In a way, Swann, yes. I had to.

125
00:56:45,868 --> 00:56:47,764
Had to? What do you mean had to?

126
00:56:48,007 --> 00:56:50,635
Well it's true that... that the war is over,

127
00:56:50,737 --> 00:56:58,035
but have you any idea what happens to people
who've been involved in a nuclear war? HAVE YOU?

128
00:56:58,134 --> 00:56:59,467
Course I haven't, I've been down here.

129
00:56:59,772 --> 00:57:05,710
Those who are lucky enough to escape the annihilation
have their bodies eaten away by radiation poisoning.

130
00:57:05,802 --> 00:57:08,310
They're deformed in mind and body.

131
00:57:08,552 --> 00:57:10,025
But this, this, this newspaper?

132
00:57:10,205 --> 00:57:13,574
They have a kind of society,
but it's... it's evil! Corrupt!

133
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:16,474
You don't think I could expose you to that sort of thing?

134
00:57:16,556 --> 00:57:18,674
Think of Mary and the other women.

135
00:57:18,762 --> 00:57:20,474
You could have told me, at least.

136
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:21,704
I decided not to.

137
00:57:21,904 --> 00:57:23,120
You should have told me.

138
00:57:23,303 --> 00:57:25,618
I thought it was best.

139
00:57:26,023 --> 00:57:30,018
And what about the natural disasters
we've been organising?

140
00:57:30,123 --> 00:57:32,456
The volcanoes, earthquakes?

141
00:57:33,118 --> 00:57:37,117
Swann, they're not fit to live.

142
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:40,148
You're murdering them, killing them off!

143
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:43,330
I want you and the others
to inherit the Earth, make a new world.

144
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:47,681
Yes, I know all about that,
but not at the price of wholesale murder!

145
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:53,209
It's not murder! If you could see
you would understand. It's an act of mercy.

146
00:57:53,316 --> 00:57:54,779
There must be some other way.

147
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:55,960
NO!

148
00:57:56,676 --> 00:58:04,364
I won't take your word any more.
I want to see for myself.

149
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:08,698
You, you, you'd be horrified.

150
00:58:08,778 --> 00:58:09,563
Maybe.

151
00:58:09,931 --> 00:58:11,432
The radiation would kill you!

152
00:58:11,576 --> 00:58:13,015
I'll chance that.

153
00:58:15,899 --> 00:58:21,764
Very well. But, but promise me one thing,
you won't tell the others.

154
00:58:22,274 --> 00:58:23,008
Why shouldn't I?

155
00:58:23,177 --> 00:58:25,860
Because I am right and you are wrong!

156
00:58:25,977 --> 00:58:31,260
You, you wouldn't want to,
you wouldn't want to hurt them like that, huh?

157
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,523
And if you're lying,
and I want to tell when I get back...?

158
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:38,056
How can I stop you?

159
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:43,968
You'd better, ah, tell them you're coming with me.

160
00:58:45,483 --> 00:58:48,268
Say er, say you've persuaded me.

161
00:58:50,683 --> 00:58:54,768
Swann, trust me, don't go ahead with this huh?

162
00:58:55,297 --> 00:58:56,334
I have to.

163
00:58:58,312 --> 00:58:59,654
Where are we?

164
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:05,497
You're in the Australasian zone.
I had you brought here especially.

165
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,403
Why?

166
00:59:06,545 --> 00:59:08,920
So that Salamander could ask you some questions.

167
00:59:09,209 --> 00:59:12,766
For all the answers he's gonna get
he might as well have left us there.

168
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:13,574
Stand up when you talk to me!

169
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:15,291
You'll get nowhere by shouting.

170
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:19,950
On the contrary. I'm going to get everything
I want from you two.

171
00:59:20,334 --> 00:59:22,035
We'll not tell you a thing.

172
00:59:24,245 --> 00:59:26,769
That's good. I like that.

173
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:30,899
- What?  - Spirit. Resistance.

174
00:59:30,972 --> 00:59:34,919
You've got plenty of both, haven't you, boy?

175
00:59:35,056 --> 00:59:39,095
Well I wonder how long you'll last.
Five minutes?

176
00:59:39,192 --> 00:59:43,519
No, a little longer, maybe? Ten, perhaps?

177
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,112
- What do you mean?
- Come now, you don't think...

178
00:59:46,273 --> 00:59:49,118
...I'm just going to sit here
and ask questions, do you?

179
00:59:49,379 --> 00:59:51,742
You must have been a nasty little boy.

180
00:59:51,843 --> 00:59:55,728
Oh I was. But I had a very enjoyable childhood.

181
00:59:58,844 --> 01:00:07,315
Ha ha hah. Yes, I thought so.
Spirit, plenty of spirit.

182
01:00:09,044 --> 01:00:15,015
Oh, we're going to enjoy ourselves, aren't we? Now then...

183
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:18,461
I... I thought you were going to take us to see Salamander?

184
01:00:18,643 --> 01:00:22,948
Yes I will. But he'd expect me to do my little best first.

185
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:25,665
You lay a finger on her, I'll kill you.

186
01:00:26,029 --> 01:00:29,732
Will you? How? Ha ha ha.

187
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:35,332
No. I think the time's come for you
to answer my questions, don't you?

188
01:00:36,529 --> 01:00:37,987
Come here, girl!

189
01:00:40,129 --> 01:00:42,332
If you don't, I shall have to shoot one of you.

190
01:00:43,429 --> 01:00:47,932
Oh, not a mortal wound. In the leg, perhaps?

191
01:00:50,456 --> 01:00:51,768
Better go. Don't worry.

192
01:00:52,961 --> 01:00:56,886
There. That's better.

193
01:00:57,234 --> 01:01:01,686
Oh, such pretty hair, don't you think?

194
01:01:01,964 --> 01:01:04,505
Alright, leave her alone. What do want to know?

195
01:01:04,674 --> 01:01:10,082
Quite a lot. And you're going to
tell me everything. Aren't you?

196
01:01:10,272 --> 01:01:11,850
- Aaah!  - All right, yes!

197
01:01:12,341 --> 01:01:14,584
Who's behind you? Is it Giles Kent?

198
01:01:17,547 --> 01:01:19,151
Oh, so they're here, eh?

199
01:01:19,455 --> 01:01:21,129
Salamander, I, I thought you were in Records?

200
01:01:21,223 --> 01:01:22,189
Have they told you anything yet?

201
01:01:22,293 --> 01:01:23,289
Not yet.

202
01:01:23,504 --> 01:01:25,832
Very well. Bruce and I will take over.

203
01:01:25,954 --> 01:01:30,492
You may go, and er,
take your little puppy dog with you, hm?

204
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:37,335
Now...

205
01:01:37,581 --> 01:01:39,067
We can't tell you anything.

206
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:42,929
Of course not. We know everything.

207
01:01:44,856 --> 01:01:47,429
We know about Giles Kent,

208
01:01:47,655 --> 01:01:49,929
we know about the girl called Astrid,

209
01:01:50,087 --> 01:01:52,529
and we know about your friend the Doctor.

210
01:01:54,438 --> 01:01:55,855
I don't believe you.

211
01:01:56,074 --> 01:01:59,177
A childish plan to impersonate me.
Yes the truth, isn't it?

212
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:00,575
Ah but he didn't agree to it.

213
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:04,599
But you two were sent to
the Central European zone to stir up trouble.

214
01:02:04,822 --> 01:02:05,912
If you want to know the truth,

215
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:08,412
Giles Kent told us a story and we weren't sure.

216
01:02:08,522 --> 01:02:10,012
Before the Doctor could do anything

217
01:02:10,106 --> 01:02:13,212
we had to come here
and find out what person you were like.

218
01:02:13,407 --> 01:02:14,742
Yeah, and we found that out right enough.

219
01:02:15,109 --> 01:02:19,468
You see Bruce, they just terrorists.
Not very big fry, either.

220
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:23,868
All this nonsense about proof against me.

221
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:27,391
If you're doing so much good for the world,
why are you so afraid for your own life?

222
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,649
Aye, and why do you have so many enemies?

223
01:02:28,717 --> 01:02:30,895
- Personal guards?
- Your own food taster?

224
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:34,121
And why destroy the one man
people trusted, Alexander Denes?

225
01:02:34,295 --> 01:02:35,890
- Aye.  - What do you mean, destroy?

226
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:36,846
One of your men shot him.

227
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:37,888
Trying to escape?

228
01:02:38,033 --> 01:02:38,900
He shot him deliberately.

229
01:02:39,041 --> 01:02:41,658
Aye. And that girl Fariah,
well she was close to Salamander,

230
01:02:41,741 --> 01:02:43,658
she'd speak against him, I know she would.

231
01:02:43,701 --> 01:02:44,744
Fariah is dead.

232
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:45,644
Dead?

233
01:02:45,783 --> 01:02:47,385
You've had her murdered too, have you?

234
01:02:47,536 --> 01:02:50,307
- Why you...
- Oh, Victoria! Don't hit me!

235
01:02:50,654 --> 01:02:53,340
You wouldn't hit your old friend the Doctor, would you?

236
01:02:54,054 --> 01:02:57,640
I wouldn't leave you in the tender mercy of Salamander.

237
01:02:58,086 --> 01:02:59,439
You're the Doctor?

238
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:02,864
You don't believe me? Oh. Huh.

239
01:03:13,642 --> 01:03:15,571
Only, you made me leave it in the TARDIS.

240
01:03:15,657 --> 01:03:17,332
- It is him!  - Oh, Doctor!

241
01:03:17,468 --> 01:03:19,986
"Tardis"? "Tardis", what's that?

242
01:03:20,181 --> 01:03:22,854
Well, it's a little place that we three have in common.

243
01:03:23,181 --> 01:03:26,454
You must admit they thought
I was Salamander to begin with.

244
01:03:26,563 --> 01:03:31,022
Yes. I concede that. But there's still no proof.

245
01:03:31,272 --> 01:03:33,808
No, but there's enough doubt in your mind...

246
01:03:33,902 --> 01:03:38,008
to make you go on asking questions, isn't there?
That's why we came here.

247
01:03:40,915 --> 01:03:44,021
Wait. What happens up there?

248
01:03:44,365 --> 01:03:48,513
Oh, it ends in a ruined building.
This is where I bring the stores,

249
01:03:48,615 --> 01:03:51,217
- uh, you would be safer here.
- Safer?

250
01:03:51,435 --> 01:03:54,753
Yes, the radiation.
I don't think it filters down here.

251
01:03:58,478 --> 01:04:00,214
I still want to see the surface.

252
01:04:00,617 --> 01:04:01,869
You will, you will.

253
01:04:04,786 --> 01:04:07,760
I should have insisted on going with him.
Bruce should have taken me.

254
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:09,854
You know he doesn't trust you.

255
01:04:10,087 --> 01:04:11,823
He wouldn't trust his own grandmother.

256
01:04:12,084 --> 01:04:13,846
Oh, never mind, Giles. We've come a long way.

257
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:18,846
Months ago, well a few weeks ago even,
nobody would have even listened to you.

258
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:19,718
Oh, maybe.

259
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:21,877
There's no maybe about it.

260
01:04:22,463 --> 01:04:26,555
Yeah perhaps you're right.
Bruce listens to us at last.

261
01:04:26,663 --> 01:04:28,755
He's even prepared to ask questions, that's fine, but...

262
01:04:28,863 --> 01:04:31,955
I know Salamander.
He'd talk his way out of the quicksand.

263
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:34,785
Well what else can we do,
the guard's still outside?

264
01:04:38,023 --> 01:04:39,651
I must get into the Research Centre.

265
01:04:39,823 --> 01:04:43,421
I've got to make sure that Bruce
understands the evidence, understands it, Astrid.

266
01:04:43,523 --> 01:04:46,621
Don't you realize, he mightn't know
what he's looking for. I know.

267
01:04:46,871 --> 01:04:50,104
But we can't attack the guard.
It would only make matters worse.

268
01:04:50,378 --> 01:04:52,417
Not if I was to give Bruce real evidence.

269
01:04:53,496 --> 01:04:57,158
Giles, how long would it take you
to get to the Research Station?

270
01:04:57,362 --> 01:05:00,238
Well just a few minutes, I've got a pass.
It's just a matter of getting there.

271
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:03,998
Alright, I think I can help you.

272
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:06,718
I'll draw the guard off and leave you alone.

273
01:05:08,831 --> 01:05:10,263
You think you can do it?

274
01:05:10,662 --> 01:05:11,847
Yes, I think so.

275
01:05:12,137 --> 01:05:14,597
But I thought you said we weren't going to attack the guard?

276
01:05:14,825 --> 01:05:16,955
Oh, we're not going to attack the guard,

277
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:20,995
but there is going to be an attack. A fatal one.

278
01:05:32,885 --> 01:05:34,308
Where does this lead?

279
01:05:34,507 --> 01:05:36,531
It goes on up and comes out in a field.

280
01:05:41,211 --> 01:05:42,292
What about radiation?

281
01:05:42,476 --> 01:05:43,722
Here it's almost negligible.

282
01:05:43,892 --> 01:05:46,427
You mean you could have brought others here from below?

283
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:50,890
I don't understand you.

284
01:05:51,042 --> 01:05:53,327
Don't you realise what a break
it would be for them,

285
01:05:53,402 --> 01:05:56,027
just moving away from that underground tomb once in a while?

286
01:05:56,129 --> 01:05:58,828
You seem to forget, Swann,
I've brought people up here before!

287
01:05:58,929 --> 01:06:00,228
There's always an element of risk!

288
01:06:00,321 --> 01:06:03,913
I still want to have a look at these people
you say are living on the surface.

289
01:06:04,187 --> 01:06:05,403
Where does that lead?

290
01:06:05,496 --> 01:06:08,205
Oh, that's a dead end.
It's a place I sometimes rest.

291
01:06:08,296 --> 01:06:11,025
It's very hard work, you know, bringing all the...

292
01:06:11,213 --> 01:06:13,831
Yes, I know that.
This way, then?

293
01:06:13,995 --> 01:06:17,769
You, you sure you... won't change your mind, huh?

294
01:06:28,094 --> 01:06:29,223
What's going on here?

295
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,307
He's been shot. Through the window.

296
01:06:32,675 --> 01:06:34,538
Alright, stand back.

297
01:06:36,223 --> 01:06:38,056
He's finished.

298
01:06:38,675 --> 01:06:40,938
Better get a doctor anyway, just in case.

299
01:06:41,905 --> 01:06:44,177
Hey! Come back!

300
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:08,065
Hellllp! Somebody help me.

301
01:07:08,422 --> 01:07:12,280
Heeellllp! Help... Somebody help me...

302
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:15,295
Who did this to you?

303
01:07:15,682 --> 01:07:20,244
A man named... Salamander.

304
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:22,179
Salamander?
