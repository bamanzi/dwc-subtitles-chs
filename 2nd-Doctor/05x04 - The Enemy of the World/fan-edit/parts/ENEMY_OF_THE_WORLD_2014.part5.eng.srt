1
00:49:27,813 --> 00:49:34,855
Over there... No, not you. Sit down, all of you.

2
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:51,323
Incredible. You fooled me the first time we met, but now, even Salamander himself would think he was looking in a mirror. /43.5
Why? You want this man to impersonate Salamander, why? How much are they paying you?

3
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:53,103
I beg your pardon?

4
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:55,820
They want you to assassinate Salamander, don't they? Take his place?

5
00:49:56,672 --> 00:49:58,420
That's ridiculous! I couldn't possibly do that.

6
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,779
But you were preparing to impersonate him, weren't you?

7
00:50:00,992 --> 00:50:01,778
Well well, yes.

8
00:50:01,926 --> 00:50:03,546
Alright then, why?

9
00:50:03,722 --> 00:50:08,304
Because Salamander holds my two friends prisoner and I was going to attempt to rescue them.

10
00:50:08,566 --> 00:50:17,061
And at the same time get evidence that would expose Salamander as a traitor, blackmailer and murderer!

11
00:50:17,257 --> 00:50:19,906
Quite an ambitious plan. How do you know such evidence exists?

12
00:50:20,078 --> 00:50:21,319
It exists in Salamander's records.

13
00:50:21,508 --> 00:50:29,965
Oh, yes, I know why you want Salamander out of the way. /24.0
You hate him because he exposed your profitable sideline of misusing public money.

14
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,558
Oh, it was Salamander who was misusing the money.

15
00:50:32,707 --> 00:50:35,934
And I was dismissed from my post and the evidence against Salamander concealed.

16
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:39,729
So you say. But you've no evidence at all against Salamander, have you?

17
00:50:39,933 --> 00:50:42,085
I tell you the evidence is in Salamander's records.

18
00:50:42,286 --> 00:50:43,762
And I'm expected to take that from you?

19
00:50:44,178 --> 00:50:49,906
We do hold evidence that Salamander isn't quite so pure and white as he's painted.

20
00:50:50,098 --> 00:50:51,439
No? What?

21
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:55,199
A file, containing certain information about a gentleman called Fedorin.

22
00:50:55,764 --> 00:51:04,185
Salamander was going to use this evidence against Fedorin. Blackmail him into submission. After he'd got rid of Denes, that is.

23
00:51:04,426 --> 00:51:06,368
And so gain control of another zone.

24
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,748
Where is this file?

25
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:10,451
Fariah has it, Salamander's food taster.

26
00:51:11,475 --> 00:51:13,940
Fariah? But she's dead.

27
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:17,315
Dead? But how?

28
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,711
She was shot by one of Benik's guards, escaping arrest.

29
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:25,813
Escaping arrest? Benik had her killed, because she had evidence against Salamander.

30
00:51:26,043 --> 00:51:30,798
And Benik will return the file to Salamander. We must get to the Research Station.

31
00:51:30,985 --> 00:51:45,234
You're not going anywhere or doing anything. As far as I'm concerned /32.5
 this story you've told me could be a pack of lies to cover your attempt to assassinate Salamander./38.0
Now I'm not saying I'm altogether satisfied with Salamander or his organisation, but I'll investigate in my own way.

32
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:52,299
Meanwhile Salamander will have found a way to cover himself, and also a way of disposing of you./50.7
You're digging your own grave, Bruce.

33
00:51:52,507 --> 00:51:55,564
That's my affair. And I do things my own way.

34
00:51:56,322 --> 00:52:03,794
And I do things my way. Really, as Head of Security, you should have more reliable guards.

35
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:08,010
Leader Salamander?

36
00:52:08,213 --> 00:52:08,776
Still inside, sir.

37
00:52:08,973 --> 00:52:10,401
Let me know the moment the doors are opened.

38
00:52:10,635 --> 00:52:11,255
Yes sir.

39
00:52:20,032 --> 00:52:23,441
So you've brought them? Good. Any trouble?

40
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,465
No, a light drug saw to that.

41
00:52:25,666 --> 00:52:27,160
Let me know the moment they wake up.

42
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:28,101
Yes sir.

43
00:52:28,644 --> 00:52:37,470
I'm looking forward to questioning them. I have the feeling they're going to be stubborn. /33.5
So much more interesting when our prisoners are stubborn.

44
00:52:41,306 --> 00:52:44,898
You're only making trouble for yourself. Killing me won't get you anywhere.

45
00:52:45,437 --> 00:52:49,411
We have to get to the Research Station, and you're not going to stop us.

46
00:52:49,605 --> 00:53:01,693
But you're completely surrounded. You don't really believe I came here with just one guard, do you?/54.5
You'd be very silly to try and fight your way out. I'd give you about... thirty seconds to live if you try.

47
00:53:01,906 --> 00:53:05,938
Alright Bruce, we might have just thirty seconds but you'd have exactly half that time, if you were lucky!

48
00:53:06,134 --> 00:53:08,861
Please, Mister Kent! You're forgetting one very important thing.

49
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,516
What?

50
00:53:09,696 --> 00:53:13,486
Me. Without me you haven't got an earthly chance of getting in that control centre.

51
00:53:13,647 --> 00:53:14,321
So?

52
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:17,778
I told you before, I will not have anything to do with violence!

53
00:53:18,044 --> 00:53:21,137
And what about your two friends? Are you going to leave them to the tender mercies of Salamander?

54
00:53:21,343 --> 00:53:24,824
No I am not. May I?

55
00:53:25,012 --> 00:53:25,692
What?

56
00:53:26,009 --> 00:53:27,923
Please? Just trust me.

57
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:33,688
Now then, I think you agree that at this moment your life is in my hands.

58
00:53:37,561 --> 00:53:38,554
What are you doing?

59
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:39,541
Hold it.

60
00:53:39,727 --> 00:53:42,656
It's alright, Mister Bruce isn't going to shoot anyone, are you?

61
00:53:42,883 --> 00:53:45,668
Why? Why'd you do that?

62
00:53:45,948 --> 00:53:49,410
Because I think I know what sort of man you are - honest and reasonable.

63
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:50,976
Go on.

64
00:53:51,282 --> 00:53:55,417
I gave you back that gun because I trust you. Now I want you to trust me.

65
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:59,016
You must be a complete fool, or very clever.

66
00:53:59,285 --> 00:54:02,736
Well I'm afraid you will have to make up your mind to that right away.

67
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,286
What do you hope to gain from this gesture?

68
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:06,836
Your confidence.

69
00:54:07,261 --> 00:54:10,562
Do you believe Kent's accusations against Salamander?

70
00:54:10,809 --> 00:54:16,139
I think there's reasonable doubt about Salamander's personal integrity, but there's only one way to get proof.

71
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:18,027
By getting into Salamander's Research Station?

72
00:54:18,281 --> 00:54:21,635
Yes. And my two young friends may have some information.

73
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:24,291
And if there isn't any evidence?

74
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:28,550
Then you'll be perfectly free to arrest us and put us in prison, won't you?

75
00:54:29,784 --> 00:54:32,849
Alright, I'll do it, on one condition.

76
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,101
And what's that?

77
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:36,561
That you and I go alone, Kent and the girl stay here as hostages.

78
00:54:36,734 --> 00:54:37,890
No wait a minute, I must go with him.

79
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:58,309
No, Kent, you stay here. I must be mad to trust you. /43.2
I only hope your impersonation of Salamander fools Benik. If it doesn't, we're in dead trouble. /48.7
Here, take this. Keep those two in the caravan. Oh, and, um, watch the girl. Come on.

80
00:55:06,114 --> 00:55:12,420
Ah, how we getting on here, huh? Ah, all this? That's a good haul.

81
00:55:14,425 --> 00:55:16,284
Stand by to make your report, Swann.

82
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,616
Reaching full power here, Swann.

83
00:55:43,525 --> 00:55:44,964
Salamander, I must see you.

84
00:55:46,624 --> 00:55:47,765
Not now, we are too busy.

85
00:55:48,113 --> 00:55:48,921
This is urgent.

86
00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:52,896
Oh very well.

87
00:56:01,502 --> 00:56:02,694
Now what's the matter, huh?

88
00:56:02,894 --> 00:56:04,266
What's this? What is this?

89
00:56:04,496 --> 00:56:05,155
What?

90
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:07,051
Newspaper. It's a piece of newspaper.

91
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:09,643
So?

92
00:56:09,843 --> 00:56:16,095
Well go on, look at it. Read it. Last year's date. Look at the bit of headline there. THERE!

93
00:56:16,276 --> 00:56:18,061
Control yourself, Swann. You'll go mad.

94
00:56:18,224 --> 00:56:33,321
"Holiday Liner Sinks"! You say there's a global war. Radiation everywhere. /23.9
How can there be holiday liners? Tell me how? 
You've lied to us, haven't you? HAVEN'T YOU?

95
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:45,637
In a way, Swann, yes. I had to.

96
00:56:45,768 --> 00:56:47,664
Had to? What do you mean had to?

97
00:56:47,907 --> 00:56:57,935
Well it's true that... that the war is over, /50.5
but have you any idea what happens to people 
who've been involved in a nuclear war? HAVE YOU?

98
00:56:58,034 --> 00:56:59,367
Course I haven't, I've been down here.

99
00:56:59,672 --> 00:57:08,210
Those who are lucky enough to escape the annihilation have their bodies eaten away by radiation poisoning. /05.6
They're deformed in mind and body.

100
00:57:08,452 --> 00:57:09,925
But this, this, this newspaper?

101
00:57:10,105 --> 00:57:18,674
They have a kind of society, but it's... it's evil! Corrupt! /13.5
You don't think I could expose you to to that sort of thing? Think of Mary and the other women.

102
00:57:18,862 --> 00:57:20,374
You could have told me, at least.

103
00:57:20,545 --> 00:57:21,604
I decided not to.

104
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:23,020
You should have told me.

105
00:57:23,203 --> 00:57:25,518
I thought it was best.

106
00:57:25,923 --> 00:57:32,358
And what about the natural disasters we've been organising? The volcanoes, earthquakes?

107
00:57:33,018 --> 00:57:37,077
Swann, they're not fit to live.

108
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:40,048
You're murdering them, killing them off!

109
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:43,630
I want you and the others to inherit the Earth, make a new world.

110
00:57:43,733 --> 00:57:47,901
Yes, I know all about that, but not at the price of wholesale murder!

111
00:57:47,991 --> 00:57:53,109
It's not murder! If you could see you would understand. It's an act of mercy.

112
00:57:53,216 --> 00:57:54,679
There must be some other way.

113
00:57:54,873 --> 00:57:55,860
NO!

114
00:57:56,776 --> 00:58:04,264
I won't take your word any more. I want to see for myself.

115
00:58:05,901 --> 00:58:08,698
You, you, you'd be horrified.

116
00:58:08,878 --> 00:58:09,663
Maybe.

117
00:58:10,031 --> 00:58:11,532
The radiation would kill you!

118
00:58:11,776 --> 00:58:13,215
I'll chance that.

119
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:21,964
Very well. But, but promise me one thing, you won't tell the others.

120
00:58:22,474 --> 00:58:23,208
Why shouldn't I?

121
00:58:23,377 --> 00:58:31,460
Because I am right and you are wrong! /26.1
You, you wouldn't want to, you wouldn't want to hurt them like that, huh?

122
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,723
And if you're lying, and I want to tell when I get back...?

123
00:58:36,383 --> 00:58:54,968
How can I stop you? You'd better, ah, tell them you're coming with me./43.8
Say er, say you've persuaded me./48.5 
Swann, trust me, don't go ahead with this huh?

124
00:58:55,497 --> 00:58:56,534
I have to.

125
00:58:58,512 --> 00:58:59,854
Where are we?

126
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:05,377
You're in the Australasian zone. I had you brought here especially.

127
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,503
Why?

128
00:59:06,745 --> 00:59:09,120
So that Salamander could ask you some questions.

129
00:59:09,409 --> 00:59:12,396
For all the answers he's gonna get he might as well have left us there.

130
00:59:12,567 --> 00:59:13,674
Stand up when you talk to me!

131
00:59:13,804 --> 00:59:15,151
You'll get nowhere by shouting.

132
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:19,950
On the contrary. I'm going to get everything I want from you two.

133
00:59:20,534 --> 00:59:22,235
We'll not tell you a thing.

134
00:59:24,445 --> 00:59:26,969
That's good. I like that.

135
00:59:27,169 --> 00:59:31,099
- What?
- Spirit. Resistance.

136
00:59:31,172 --> 00:59:43,719
You've got plenty of both, haven't you, boy? Well I wonder how long you'll last. /37.0
Five minutes? No, a little longer, maybe? Ten, perhaps?

137
00:59:43,988 --> 00:59:45,312
What do you mean?

138
00:59:45,473 --> 00:59:49,318
Come now, you don't think I'm just going to sit here and ask questions, do you?

139
00:59:49,579 --> 00:59:51,782
You must have been a nasty little boy.

140
00:59:52,043 --> 00:59:55,928
Oh I was. But I had a very enjoyable childhood.

141
00:59:59,044 --> 01:00:15,215
Ha ha hah. Yes, I thought so. Spirit, plenty of spirit. /07.5
Oh, we're going to enjoy ourselves, aren't we? Now then...

142
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:18,661
I... I thought you were going to take us to see Salamander?

143
01:00:18,843 --> 01:00:23,148
Yes I will. But he'd expect me to do my little best first.

144
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:25,865
You lay a finger on her, I'll kill you.

145
01:00:26,229 --> 01:00:48,132
Will you? How? Ha ha ha. No. I think the time's come for you to answer my questions, don't you? /35.5
Come here, girl! If you don't, I shall have to shoot one of you. /42.2
Oh, not a mortal wound. In the leg, perhaps?

146
01:00:50,656 --> 01:00:51,968
Better go. Don't worry.

147
01:00:53,161 --> 01:01:01,886
There. That's better. Oh, such pretty hair, don't you think?

148
01:01:02,164 --> 01:01:04,705
Alright, leave her alone. What do want to know?

149
01:01:04,874 --> 01:01:10,022
Quite a lot. And you're going to tell me everything. Aren't you?

150
01:01:10,535 --> 01:01:11,076
Aaah!

151
01:01:11,272 --> 01:01:12,050
All right, yes!

152
01:01:12,241 --> 01:01:14,284
Who's behind you? Is it Giles Kent?

153
01:01:16,647 --> 01:01:18,881
Oh, so they're here, eh?

154
01:01:19,095 --> 01:01:20,729
Salamander, I, I thought you were in Records?

155
01:01:20,893 --> 01:01:22,089
Have they told you anything yet?

156
01:01:22,393 --> 01:01:23,389
Not yet.

157
01:01:23,604 --> 01:01:30,232
Very well. Bruce and I will take over. You may go, and er, take your little puppy dog with you, hm?

158
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,435
Now...

159
01:01:37,681 --> 01:01:39,167
We can't tell you anything.

160
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:52,629
Of course not. We know everything. We know about Giles Kent, /47.5
we know about the girl called Astrid, and we know about your friend the Doctor.

161
01:01:54,538 --> 01:01:55,955
I don't believe you.

162
01:01:56,174 --> 01:01:59,277
A childish plan to impersonate me. Yes the truth, isn't it?

163
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:00,675
Ah but he didn't agree to it.

164
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:04,699
But you two were sent to the Central European road zone to stir up trouble.

165
01:02:04,922 --> 01:02:13,312
If you want to know he truth, Giles Kent told us a story and we weren't sure. /08.5
Before the Doctor could do anything we had to come here and find out what person you were like.

166
01:02:13,507 --> 01:02:14,842
Yeah, and we found that out right enough.

167
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:23,968
You see Bruce, they just terrorists. Not very big fry, either. /19.6
All this nonsense about proof against me.

168
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:27,491
If you're doing so much good for the world, why are you so afraid for your own life?

169
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,749
Aye, and why do you have so many enemies?

170
01:02:28,817 --> 01:02:30,995
- Personal guards?
- Your own food taster?

171
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:34,221
And why destroy the one man people trusted, Alexander Denes?

172
01:02:34,395 --> 01:02:35,990
- Aye.
- What do you mean, destroy?

173
01:02:36,186 --> 01:02:36,946
One of your men shot him.

174
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:37,988
Trying to escape?

175
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:39,000
He shot him deliberately.

176
01:02:39,141 --> 01:02:43,758
Aye. And that girl Fariah, well she was close to Salamander, she'd speak against him, I know she would.

177
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:44,844
Fariah is dead.

178
01:02:44,993 --> 01:02:45,744
Dead?

179
01:02:45,883 --> 01:02:47,485
You've had her murdered too, have you?

180
01:02:47,636 --> 01:02:48,407
Why you...

181
01:02:48,554 --> 01:02:57,740
Oh, Victoria! Don't hit me! You wouldn't hit your old friend the Doctor, would you?/53.5
 I wouldn't leave you in the tender mercy of Salamander.

182
01:02:58,186 --> 01:02:59,539
You're the Doctor?

183
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:02,964
You don't believe me? Oh. Huh.

184
01:03:13,742 --> 01:03:15,471
Only, you made me leave it in the TARDIS.

185
01:03:15,657 --> 01:03:16,432
It is him!

186
01:03:16,581 --> 01:03:17,365
Oh, Doctor!

187
01:03:17,568 --> 01:03:20,086
"Tardis"? "Tardis", what's that?

188
01:03:20,281 --> 01:03:26,304
Well, it's a little place that we three have in common. /23.0
You must admit they thought I was Salamander to begin with.

189
01:03:26,663 --> 01:03:31,122
Yes. I concede that. But there's still no proof.

190
01:03:31,372 --> 01:03:38,108
No, but there's enough doubt in your mind to make you go on asking questions, isn't there? That's why we came here.

191
01:03:41,015 --> 01:03:44,121
Wait. What happens up there?

192
01:03:44,465 --> 01:03:50,213
Oh, it ends in a ruined building. This is where I bring the stores, uh, you would be safer here.

193
01:03:50,415 --> 01:03:51,317
Safer?

194
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:54,853
Yes, the radiation. I don't think it filters down here.

195
01:03:58,578 --> 01:04:00,314
I still want to see the surface.

196
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:01,969
You will, you will.

197
01:04:04,886 --> 01:04:07,860
I should have insisted on going with him. Bruce should have taken me.

198
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,954
You know he doesn't trust you.

199
01:04:10,187 --> 01:04:11,923
He wouldn't trust his own grandmother.

200
01:04:12,184 --> 01:04:18,946
Oh, never mind, Giles. We've come a long way. /14.0
Months ago, well a few weeks ago even, nobody would have even listened to you.

201
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:19,818
Oh, maybe.

202
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,977
There's no maybe about it.

203
01:04:22,563 --> 01:04:32,055
Yeah perhaps you're right. Bruce listens to us at last. /25.5
He's even prepared to ask questions, that's fine, but.../28.9 
I know Salamander. He'd talk his way out of the quicksand.

204
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:34,885
Well what else can we do, the guard's still outside?

205
01:04:38,123 --> 01:04:46,721
I must get into the Research Centre.#39.8
I've got to make sure that Bruce understands the evidence, understands it, Astrid. /43.5
Don't you realize, he mightn't know what he's looking for. I know.

206
01:04:46,971 --> 01:04:50,204
But we can't attack the guard. It would only make matters worse.

207
01:04:50,478 --> 01:04:52,517
Not if I was to give Bruce real evidence.

208
01:04:53,596 --> 01:04:57,258
Giles, how long would it take you to get to the Research Station?

209
01:04:57,462 --> 01:05:00,338
Well just a few minutes, I've got a pass. It's just a matter of getting there.

210
01:05:01,947 --> 01:05:06,618
Alright, I think I can help you. I'll draw the guard off and leave you alone.

211
01:05:08,931 --> 01:05:10,363
You think you can do it?

212
01:05:10,762 --> 01:05:11,947
Yes, I think so.

213
01:05:12,237 --> 01:05:14,697
But I thought you said we weren't going to attack the guard?

214
01:05:14,925 --> 01:05:21,095
Oh, we're not going to attack the guard, but there is going to be an attack. A fatal one.

215
01:05:32,985 --> 01:05:34,408
Where does this lead?

216
01:05:34,607 --> 01:05:36,631
It goes on up and comes out in a field.

217
01:05:41,311 --> 01:05:42,392
What about radiation?

218
01:05:42,576 --> 01:05:43,822
Here it's almost negligible.

219
01:05:43,992 --> 01:05:55,927
You mean you could have brought others here from below? /45.9
/49.0 I don't understand you. Don't you realise what a break it would be for them, /52.9
just moving away from that underground tomb once in a while?

220
01:05:56,129 --> 01:06:00,128
You seem to forget, Swann, I've brought people up here before! There's always an element of risk!

221
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:05,213
I still want to have a look at these people you say are living on the surface. Where does that lead?

222
01:06:05,396 --> 01:06:11,125
Oh, that's a dead end. It's a place I sometimes rest. It's very hard work, you know, bringing all the...

223
01:06:11,313 --> 01:06:12,931
Yes, I know that. This way, then?

224
01:06:13,095 --> 01:06:17,569
You, you sure you... won't change your mind, huh?

225
01:06:28,194 --> 01:06:29,323
What's going on here?

226
01:06:29,619 --> 01:06:32,407
He's been shot. Through the window.

227
01:06:32,775 --> 01:06:40,638
Alright, stand back. He's finished. Better get a doctor anyway, just in case.

228
01:06:42,005 --> 01:06:44,277
Hey! Come back!

229
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:12,380
Hellllp! Somebody help me. Heeellllp! Help... Somebody help me...

230
01:07:14,044 --> 01:07:15,395
Who did this to you?

231
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:20,344
A man named... Salamander.

232
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:22,279
Salamander?
