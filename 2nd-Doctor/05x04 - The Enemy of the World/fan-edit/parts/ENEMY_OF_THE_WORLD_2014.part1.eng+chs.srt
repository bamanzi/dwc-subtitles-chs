他在离海岸一英里的地方淹死了. 可怕的谋杀啊!

the police or whatever?

Because I'm discredited, don't you see?

80
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,082
Because Salamander is so popular,

81
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:04,582
and also because the man that took my place,
a man named Donald Bruce...

...has since risen to become overall security chief.

Ah yes, Helvig believed me.
So did Assevski, and they're dead.
啊是有, Helvig 信我, Assevski 也是, 而他们都死了

a man named Alexander Denes,

I'm surprised.

then why hasn't he tried to...

89
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:28,736
- Dispose of me?  - Yes

90
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:30,662
Well he has, but he's afraid.
他试过, 但他害怕

91

still holds legal weight.

94
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,413

95
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,223

00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:45,874
Yes I thought that's what we were leading up to.

Well I must admit, Doctor, you do look like him.

00:10:48,942 --> 00:10:50,641

101
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,682
Well it's nearly the same pitch, only the accent.
调门差不多, 只是口音问题

102

Only the accent! My dear young lady.

103
00:10:55,222 --> 00:11:01,790
Oh dear. Now what was it he said...

104
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:08,490
We still cannot guarantee good summer holidays for all.
"但我们无法保障所有地方都有漂亮的夏日"

105

You see, it's very difficult.
不对. "保障..." 不不不, "保...保障"．你看, 这非常困难

106
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:18,070
Hmm, of course I always was interested in phonetics

Holidays... summer... summer.

Quintana Roo or Yucatan or somewhere...
他肯定是来自墨西哥, Quintana Roo 州或者 Yucatan 州什么的

state capital of Yucatan.
神啊, 博士．他出生在 Merida, 是 Yucantan 州的省会

Yes, there are other very strong influences though.
是了, 但还受到了一些其它地方的强印象

111
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:36,458
Oh, I could do it in time.
But what if I did it, what then?
噢, 我可以及时搞定．但如果我搞定了, 然后怎样？

112
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:39,665
You could walk into Salamander's research station at Kanowa,
你可以进入 Salamander 在 Kanowa 的研究站

113
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:43,765
find out how he's getting control of the separate

Yes. I see.

115
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:56,165
How long did you say it would take you
to master Salamander's accent?

Donald Bruce, has since cordoned off this entire area.

I'd say you've got about two minutes, Doctor.

121
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:13,894
But that's out of the question!

122
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,828
You know what he'll do as soon as he sees you,/?

a man who resembles Salamander so closely?

- 噢, 真不公平！  - 你肯听我说一句吗！

as soon as he sees you. I mean it.
他一看见你, 你就会因冒充而被逮捕的．我说真的

126
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:25,134
But isn't there another way out of this?
但就没有别的办法了吗？

127
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:26,937
Only one - be Salamander.
只有一个 - 成为 Salamander

128
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:27,970
But the clothes!

I won't! I can't!
