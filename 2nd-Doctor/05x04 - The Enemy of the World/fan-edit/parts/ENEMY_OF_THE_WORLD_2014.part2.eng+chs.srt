1
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:34,737
Hello Bruce, what are you doing here, eh?
你好 Bruce, 你在这里做什么, 嗯?

2
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:40,077
I was under the impression
you were in the Central European Zone, Leader.
我得到的印象是, 你还在中欧区, 领袖

4
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:44,342
Why?
为什么？

5
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,452
I do not care to be questioned by my own security!
我不喜欢被我自己的安保人员质问！

6
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:52,903
Well that's just it. How can I possibly
maintain security when you behave like this?
好我正要说这个．你行为这样, 我怎么能保障安全呢？

7
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,003
I'm at least entitled to know your movements.
我至少有权知晓你的动向吧

8
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:58,209
You have a policeman's mind, Bruce.
你有一个警察的思维, Bruce

9
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:02,516
That may be! Only a few days ago you questioned me
about this man and his activities.
可能吧！仅仅几天以前, 你还在问我这个人和他的活动情况

10
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:06,116
And we agreed that he was dangerous!
Now, I find you in his office.
而且我们都同意他很危险！ 而现在, 我发现你在他的办公室

11
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:12,654
Sometimes I like to deal with matters in my own way.
有时候我喜欢用我自己的方式处理问题

12
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:16,615
- They're not holding you here?  - Holding me?

Under some threat or other.
你被威胁了什么的

14

I still think I deserve an explanation, Leader.
我还是觉得我需要一个解释, 领袖

16
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:26,526
Yes, of course, you shall have it.

But not now. When I return from the Central European Zone.

18
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,080
Very well.
那好

19
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,254
Now what about the dead man found in your bungalow.
现在说说在你的平房里发现的死人吧

20
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,254
He was one of your lot, wasn't he?
他是你们当中的一个, 对吧？

21
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:45,923
Yes. Um, he was trying to protect me.
The other two wanted to kill me.
是的．唔, 他当时在尽力保护我, 另外那两个人想杀我

22
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:49,404
Now why should they want to do that
to a nice young girl like you?
那为什么他们会对你这样一个年轻女孩儿做那种事情？

23
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:50,629
Well I...
这个我...

24
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,881
Obviously they thought I was there.

Yes, Bruce, just like you,
a lot of people don't like me.
是的, Bruce, 跟你一样, 很多人不喜欢我

27
00:15:57,911 --> 00:16:01,551
Don't get clever with me, Kent!
I've a good mind to...

That's interesting, but not important.
这很有意思, 但并不重要

31
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:09,022
I accept it! That's all that matters.
我接受！这才是重要的

32
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:12,577
It's beginning to look as if these people
are working for you now. Is that right?
看起来, 这些人现在为你工作了？是这样吗？

33
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:19,003
You still dare to question me!
They have information! I shall get it!

00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,803
I will see you on my return. Now leave me!
我回去之后会见你, 现在消失吧！

35
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:29,540
- McCrimmon, you said?  - Aye

36
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,267
Well you just watch your step, that's all.
好, 你看好你的步子, 小心点

37
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:39,025
I never said a word.
我什么也没说啊

38
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:44,239
Must be the way you look, Jamie.

That was a dangerous game to play.

It paid off. All right, are you with us?

I don't know where you stand, Mr Kent.
我并不知道你的立场, Kent 先生

on opposite sides. That at least is clear.
但你和这个 Salamander 显然是对立的, 这点至少是清楚的

45

And why should I interfere?
但那一方是好的, 那一方是坏的？为什么我要插手？

46
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:09,878
Well you're the only man who can help save the world.

Don't you understand? Salamander...

on a challenge like this, Doctor.

Well, at least I know you wouldn't.

We don't know anything about these people.

- 噢, 但是Jamie, 你不是觉得...  - 嘿, 她是...

Look, we're right about Salamander!

It won't take you long to find out for yourselves.

You still don't believe me?
