1
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:34,737
Hello Bruce, what are you doing here, eh?
你好 Bruce, 你在这里做什么, 嗯?

2
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:40,077
I was under the impression
you were in the Central European Zone, Leader.
我得到的印象是, 你还在中欧区, 领袖

3
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:43,483
That's what you were meant to believe.
那正是要让你们相信的

4
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:44,342
Why?
为什么？

5
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,452
I do not care to be questioned by my own security!
我不喜欢被我自己的安保人员质问！

6
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:52,903
Well that's just it. How can I possibly
maintain security when you behave like this?
好我正要说这个．你行为这样, 我怎么能保障安全呢？

7
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,003
I'm at least entitled to know your movements.
我至少得知晓你的动向吧

8
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:58,209
You have a policeman's mind, Bruce.
你有一个警察的思维, Bruce

9
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:02,516
That may be! Only a few days ago you questioned me
about this man and his activities.
可能吧！仅仅几天以前, 你还在问我这个人和他的活动情况

10
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:06,116
And we agreed that he was dangerous!
Now, I find you in his office.
而且我们都同意他是个危险人物！ 而现在, 我在他的办公室找到了你

11
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:12,654
Sometimes I like to deal with matters in my own way.
有时候我喜欢用我自己的方式处理问题

12
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:16,615
- They're not holding you here?  - Holding me?

14
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:18,449
Under some threat or other.
你被威胁了什么的

15
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:20,475
No one threatens Salamander!

16
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:23,032
I still think I deserve an explanation, Leader.
我还是觉得我需要一个解释, 领袖

17
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:26,526
Yes, of course, you shall have it.

18
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:31,526
But not now. When I return from the Central European Zone.
但不是现在．等我从中欧区返回吧

19
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,080
Very well.
那好

20
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,254
Now what about the dead man found in your bungalow.
现在说说在你的平房里发现的死人吧

21
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,254
He was one of your lot, wasn't he?
他本是你的人, 对吧？

22
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:45,923
Yes. Um, he was trying to protect me.
The other two wanted to kill me.
是的．唔, 他当时在尽力保护我, 另外那两个人想杀我

23
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:49,404
Now why should they want to do that
to a nice young girl like you?
那为什么他们会对一个你这样的年轻女孩儿做那种事情？

24
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:50,629
Well I...
这个我...

25
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,881
Obviously they thought I was there.
显然他们以为我在那里

26
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:55,616
You?
你？

27
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:57,817
Yes, Bruce, just like you,
a lot of people don't like me.
是的, Bruce, 跟你一样, 很多人不喜欢我

28
00:15:57,911 --> 00:16:01,551
Don't get clever with me, Kent!
I've a good mind to...
别跟我耍聪明, Kent! 我有一个好想法....

29
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,352
I am prepared to accept his story.

That's interesting, but not important.
这很有意思, 但并不重要

32
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:09,022
I accept it! That's all that matters.
我接受！这是唯一重要的事情

33
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:12,577
It's beginning to look as if these people
are working for you now. Is that right?
看起来, 这些人现在为你工作了？是这样吗？

34
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:19,003
You still dare to question me!
They have information! I shall get it! 
你还在质问我？他们有情报, 我要得到！

35
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,803
I will see you on my return. Now leave me!
我回去之后会见你, 现在消失吧！

36
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:29,540
- McCrimmon, you said?  - Aye
- 你叫 McCrimmon, 你说过？  - 是

38
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,267
Well you just watch your step, that's all.
好, 你看好你的步子, 小心点

39
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:39,025
I never said a word.
我什么也没说

40
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:44,239
Must be the way you look, Jamie.
那肯定是你的样子看起来有问题, Jamie

41
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:45,832
You were splendid, Doctor.

That was a dangerous game to play.

It paid off. All right, are you with us?

45
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,373
I don't know where you stand, Mr Kent.
我并不知道你的立场, Kent 先生

46
00:16:55,429 --> 00:17:01,473
But you and this Salamander are obviously 
on opposite sides. That at least is clear.
但你和这个 Salamander 显然是对立的, 这点至少是清楚的

47
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:06,773
But which side is good? Which side is bad? 
And why should I interfere?
但那一方是好的, 那一方是坏的？为什么我要插手？

48
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:09,878
Well you're the only man who can help save the world.
不过你是唯一可以帮忙拯救这个世界的

49
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:12,523
But isn't that what Salamander's trying to do?

50
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:14,036
Don't you understand? Salamander...
你不明白吗？ Salamander...

51
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:17,271
Just a moment. Jamie, you're unusually quiet,
what do you think?
等一下．Jamie, 通常你都很安静, 你怎么想的？

aye, well it sounds grand, but...
哦, 拯救世界, 是, 这听起来很伟大, 但是...

on a challenge like this, Doctor.

Well, at least I know you wouldn't.

55
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:26,520
We don't know anything about these people.

56
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,680
Astrid saved our lives. She was wounded because of it.
Astrid 救了我们的命, 她为此还受伤了

57
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:30,206

- 噢, 但是Jamie, 你不是觉得...  - 嘿, 她是...

Look, we're right about Salamander! 
看, 我们对 Salamander 的看法是对的！

59
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:34,258
It won't take you long to find out for yourselves.

60
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:35,823
How do you propose we do that?

He'll be well guarded for a start.

We can hardly steal into his study
and go through his papers.

he was in the Central European Zone.

I've had a plan for infiltrating into
Salamander's inner circle for some time.
我之前做了个计划是在某个时候渗透到 Salamander 的小圈子里面去

Oh, I see. What about me?

Salamander's research station at Kanowa.

是的．啊, 是, 但当然是从一个安全距离来看

你的区域有危险了, Denes．这里, 这里和这里

You don't imagine I make it up?

No, no, of course not.

Fedorin is right to doubt.
这些火山自从16世纪就沉寂了．Fedorin 的疑问是有理由的

I tell you the truth.
火山是一个奇怪的东西, 我的朋友。我来跟你说说真实情况

sleeping... still... lifeless.

miscalculation for a few degrees?
有没有可能在计算上有少许几度的偏差?

You still don't believe me?

They are very clever men dedicated to their work.
