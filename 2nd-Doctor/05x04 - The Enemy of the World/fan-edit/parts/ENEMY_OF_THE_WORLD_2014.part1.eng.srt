1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,968
(Sincro: bamanzi)

2
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,916
Oh, there's nothing like a dip to freshen you up.

3
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,213
Hey, that's a funny looking boat.

4
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,767
It's not a boat, it's a hovercraft.

5
00:00:51,904 --> 00:00:52,646
Eh?

6
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,437
You're right, it is him.

7
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,529
What are we going to do?

8
00:00:57,563 --> 00:01:00,371
A terrifying thing. It's like a sea monster.

9
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:02,473
Oh, we'll soon get a closer look, it's coming nearer.

10
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:05,760
Oh yes. Yes.

11
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:12,060
I don't think I like the look of this. Let's go.

12
00:01:12,144 --> 00:01:14,256
- Why, what's the matter?  - Come on, run!

13
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:16,133
- Yeah, but...  - Don't argue, run.

14
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,700
Over here!

15
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,600
Hurry!

16
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,816
Incredible.

17
00:05:53,656 --> 00:05:56,716
Absolutely incredible.

18
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:58,830
I'm not a specimen in a glass bowl, you know?

19
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:00,460
Ah, I'm sorry. Do sit down.

20
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:01,578
Oh, thank you.

21
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:06,634
It's just so astonishing. You are Salamander.

22
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:07,563
Do you see what I mean?

23
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,210
But surely you know how alike you are?

24
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:11,010
After all, Salamander is a world figure.

25
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,807
Well... well my friends and I, we..

26
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,577
we've been out of touch...
with civilisation for a while.

27
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:19,577
We're visitors, so to speak, um.
On ice shall we say.

28
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,090
I see. Where shall I start?

29
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:26,785
At the beginning please.
We've been subjected to a number of attacks

30
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:29,785
because I look like this Salamander of yours.

31
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:34,785
I'm not surprised. I'll show you why.

32
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:37,149
I have a video wire of Salamander,

33
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:40,549
addressing the United Zones Conference on World Food.

34
00:06:40,622 --> 00:06:46,079
And meanwhile, over at the United Zones General Assembly,
from all over the world delegates are flocking in,

35
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:50,219
eager to hear the latest report from Leader Salamander.

36
00:06:50,499 --> 00:07:01,871
The progress, Mr President, of the Sun Conservation
establishment at Kanowa, in the Australasian Zone is...

37
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:07,188
...I'm delighted to report highly satisfactory.

38
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:14,696
But we cannot yet guarantee good summer holidays for all.

39
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:22,189
However, we have now in orbit the Mark VII Sun Catcher...

40
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:29,939
and already we have been able to
concentrate the sun's rays into much needed areas.

41
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:35,939
The great Canadian wheat plains are safe.

42
00:07:37,388 --> 00:07:44,391
And now, Mr President: Ukraine - the grain field of the planet -

43
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:49,191
an unfortunate area between Bucava and Kirovograd

44
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:54,191
devastated by the elements two short years ago.

45
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:58,391
What have I got to say to you about that?

46
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:06,591
I can tell you that on both banks of the Dnieper river
the corn is ripening in the sun!

47
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:15,191
And ten-thousand robot harvesters are moving down
to gather in fifty million tons of flour!

48
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,860
There's nothing there to say he's a bad man.

49
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:22,141
I quite agree, Victoria.
He seems to be a public benefactor.

50
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:24,741
Quite a speaker too and remarkably handsome,
didn't you think so Jamie?

51
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:26,856
He's one of the most popular men on the planet.

52
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:28,856
Many people call him the shopkeeper of the world.

53
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:30,956
The saviour, in fact, some of them.

54
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,158
Well what's he saved the world from?

55
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:34,741
Starvation - too many people, too little food.

56
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,305
Until Salamander invented his Sun Store.
Surely you've heard? You must know?

57
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:40,185
Oh yes, well of course we've heard something.

58
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:44,813
The Sun Store collects the rays from the sun
and stores them in concentrated form.

59
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,596
Oh, like the ioniser, Doctor?

60
00:08:46,755 --> 00:08:48,572
Yes, a rather different principle I think, Jamie.

61
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,265
Well never mind how it works! What's it for?

62
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:55,729
Salamander can force-grow three,
sometimes four, crops in one summer.

63
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:57,395
Well why do these men want to kill him.

64
00:08:57,434 --> 00:08:59,395
I mean, one minute you say he's saving the world, the next...

65
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:03,749
For his own ends! Step by step
he's taking control of this planet.

66
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,338
You have proof of this?

67
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:11,300
Some, yes. I was once a high official
in the World Zone Authority

68
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:16,600
Deputy Security Leader for North Africa and Europe,
but Salamander discredited and ruined me

69
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:19,600
because he realized I was beginning to get suspicious.

70
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:22,879
But you could be making up stories about Salamander!
Out of revenge.

71
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:29,674
Yes, I suppose so. Then you can judge for yourself.

72
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:36,404
You remember Michael Assevski -
he was Controller of the Eastern European Zone?

73
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:42,374
He was drowned at sea a mile from shore.
(s/Shockingly/Hockingham,/) murdered!

74
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:47,474
All of them were seen with Salamander,
or a man known as his deputy

75
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:49,474
shortly before their deaths.

76
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:52,946
All of them were replaced by men
known to be in Salamander's power.

77
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:54,796
- Known by who?   - By me, Doctor.

78
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,357
Well why don't you tell the authorities,
the police or whatever?

79
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,582
Because I'm discredited, don't you see?

80
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,082
Because Salamander is so popular,

81
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:04,582
and also because the man that took my place,
a man named Donald Bruce...

82
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:06,582
...has since risen to become overall security chief.

83
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:08,411
Surely there is someone you can take your story to?

84
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:13,956
Ah yes, Helvig believed me.
So did Assevski, and they're dead.

85
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:17,406
However, there is one other man,
a man named Alexander Denes,

86
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:20,056
but none of them will do anything until it's too late!

87
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:22,007
I'm surprised.

88
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:27,007
Well if Salamander is everything you say he is,
then why hasn't he tried to...

89
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:28,736
- Dispose of me?  - Yes

90
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:30,662
Well he has, but he's afraid.

91
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:33,662
You see, the testimony of a dead man
still holds legal weight.

92
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:38,508
Oh, I see. Well, it seems we have a problem on our hands...

93
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,608
...whether to believe Mr Kent or not.

94
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,413
Well there is one way that you can find out for yourselves.

95
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,223
Oh, how?

96
00:10:42,338 --> 00:10:43,624
Impersonate Salamander.

97
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:45,874
Yes I thought that's what we were leading up to.

98
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,885
Well I must admit, Doctor, you do look like him.

99
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:48,826
Exactly like him.

100
00:10:48,942 --> 00:10:50,641
Yes, there's more to it than that. What about the voice?

101
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,682
Well it's nearly the same pitch, only the accent.

102
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:55,190
Only the accent! My dear young lady.

103
00:10:55,222 --> 00:11:01,790
Oh dear. Now what was it he said...

104
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:08,490
We still cannot guarantee good summer holidays for all.

105
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:13,270
No. Guarantee... no, no, no... guaran... guarantee.
You see, it's very difficult.

106
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:18,070
Hmm, of course I always was interested in phonetics

107
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:20,670
Holidays... summer... summer.

108
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:25,410
He must have come from Mexico,
Quintana Roo or Yucatan or somewhere...

109
00:11:25,504 --> 00:11:28,909
That's incredible, Doctor, he was born at Merida,
state capital of Yucatan.

110
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:32,658
Yes, there are other very strong influences though.

111
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:36,458
Oh, I could do it in time.
But what if I did it, what then?

112
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:39,665
You could walk into Salamander's research station at Kanowa,

113
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:43,765
find out how he's getting control of the separate
World Zones, and then bring out absolute proof.

114
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:51,129
Yes. I see.

115
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:56,165
How long did you say it would take you
to master Salamander's accent?

116
00:11:56,421 --> 00:12:00,009
I didn't. It would take three weeks, perhaps four.

117
00:12:00,206 --> 00:12:03,339
Well while we've been talking,
the Security Chief I told you about,

118
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:06,639
Donald Bruce, has since cordoned off this entire area.

119
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,939
He's coming here himself...Now!

120
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:12,939
I'd say you've got about two minutes, Doctor.

121
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:13,894
But that's out of the question!

122
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,828
You know what he'll do as soon as he sees you,/?

123
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,528
a man who resembles Salamander so closely?

124
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,352
- Oh that's not fair!
- Will you please listen!

125
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:23,585
You'll be under arrest for impersonation
as soon as he sees you. I mean it.

126
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:25,134
But isn't there another way out of this?

127
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:26,937
Only one - be Salamander.

128
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:27,970
But the clothes!

129
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:32,700
Yes, there are some in here.
A little less eccentric, but do the best you can.

130
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:34,038
I won't! I can't!

131
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:35,399
Your friends, Doctor, do you want them to suffer?

132
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:37,199
Because they will, you know.

133
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,704
No, wait a minute! Why is a man like Bruce coming here?

134
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:40,909
Don't push me, there isn't time.

135
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:43,343
You sent for him, didn't you? You tipped him off!

136
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,525
I couldn't miss an opportunity like this,
now please come on.

137
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,024
Giles, for heaven's sake, what have you done?
It's far too risky.

138
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:01,820
Hello Kent. Doing some recruiting are you?

139
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:04,420
A bit young for killers, aren't they?

140
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:05,975
What do you mean?

141
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:07,832
All right, what do you mean by stepping in here like this?

142
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:11,632
Anytime, Kent. I've got the right and you know it.
Anytime I like.

143
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:15,469
All right, what do you want?

144
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,752
That's better, you're ex-security,
you know the way it's got to go.

145
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:20,952
We might as well be nice and civil about it, mightn't we?

146
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:26,548
That bungalow in Cedar District. In your name, right?

147
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:27,497
Why?

148
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:31,781
Do I have to tell you?
There's been an awful nasty mess out there.

149
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:34,481
Someone has got himself shot in your living room.

150
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:37,843
- And who are you two?  - Jamie McCrimmon

151
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:39,326
- And?  - Victoria Waterfield

152
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:41,666
- What's the matter, can't you speak?
- Don't shout at me.

153
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,748
Oh, very good, the outraged public citizen.

154
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:47,128
- Do they know who I am?
- Yes they do.

155
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:49,636
A pity, I like to hear you say it.

156
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:52,436
Now listen to this, all of you.

157
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:56,936
One of your men was murdered in a bungalow rented to you.

158
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:59,736
The remains of two others were found
in what was left of a helicopter.

159
00:13:59,849 --> 00:14:02,336
You were in that bungalow at the time.

160
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:07,136
And there were three other people with you,
two youngsters and a man. Right?

161
00:14:08,235 --> 00:14:10,143
Now, there was another man, wasn't there?

162
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:13,343
So we'll deal with that first? Where is he?

163
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:36,354
Why hello Bruce, what are you doing here, huh?
