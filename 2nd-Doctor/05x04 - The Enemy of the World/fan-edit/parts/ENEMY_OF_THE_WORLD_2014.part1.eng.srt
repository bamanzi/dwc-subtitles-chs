1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:09,968
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,816
Oh, there's nothing like a dip to freshen you up.

3
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:49,113
Hey, that's a funny looking boat.

4
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,567
It's not a boat, it's a hovercraft.

5
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:51,346
Eh?

6
00:00:51,662 --> 00:00:53,337
You're right, it is him.

7
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,929
What are we going to do?

8
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:59,771
A terrifying thing. It's like a sea monster.

9
00:00:59,922 --> 00:01:01,873
Oh, we'll soon get a closer look, it's coming nearer.

10
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:05,160
Oh yes. Yes.

11
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:11,560
 I don't think I like the look of this. Let's go.

12
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:12,856
Why, what's the matter?

13
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:13,762
Come on, run!

14
00:01:13,926 --> 00:01:14,567
Yeah, but...

15
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:15,933
Don't argue, run.

16
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,500
Over here!

17
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,400
Hurry!

18
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,616
Incredible. 

19
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:56,516
Absolutely incredible.

20
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,530
I'm not a specimen in a glass bowl, you know?

21
00:05:58,722 --> 00:06:00,060
Ah, I'm sorry. Do sit down.

22
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:01,178
Oh, thank you.

23
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:06,134
It's just so astonishing. You are Salamander.

24
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:07,163
Do you see what I mean?

25
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:10,610
But surely you know how alike you are?
After all, Salamander is a world figure.

26
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:15,177
Well... well my friends and I, we've been 
out of touch... with civilisation for a while.

27
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:19,177
We're visitors, so to speak, um. On ice shall we say.

28
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:22,790
I see. Where shall I start?

29
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:26,485
At the beginning please.
We've been subjected to a number of attacks

30
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:29,485
because I look like this Salamander of yours.

31
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:34,485
I'm not surprised. I'll show you why.

32
00:06:34,673 --> 00:06:40,249
I have a video wire of Salamander, addressing
the United Zones Conference on World Food.

33
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:45,779
And meanwhile, over at the United Zones General Assembly, 
from all over the world delegates are flocking in, 

34
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:49,919
eager to hear the latest report from Leader Salamander.

35
00:06:50,999 --> 00:07:01,571
The progress, Mr President, of the Sun Conservation 
establishment at Kanowa, in the Australasian Zone...

36
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:06,888
...is I'm delighted to report highly satisfactory.

37
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:14,896
But we cannot yet guarantee good summer holidays for all.

38
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:35,639
However, we have now in orbit the Mark VII Sun Catcher,
and already we have been able to
concentrate the sun's rays into much needed areas.
The great Canadian wheat plains are safe.

39
00:07:37,088 --> 00:08:15,891
And now, Mr President: Ukraine
- the grain field of the planet -
an unfortunate area between Bucava and Kirovograd
devastated by the elements two short years ago.
What have I got to say to you about that?
I can tell you that on both banks of the Dnieper river
the corn is ripening in the sun!
And ten-thousand robot harvesters are moving down
to gather in fifty million tons of flour!

40
00:08:16,572 --> 00:08:18,260
There's nothing there to say he's a bad man.

41
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:24,441
I quite agree, Victoria.
He seems to be a public benefactor.
uite a speaker too and remarkably handsome,
didn't you think so Jamie?

42
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:30,356
He's one of the most popular men on the planet.
Many people call him the shopkeeper of the world.
The saviour, in fact, some of them.

43
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,858
Well what's he saved the world from?

44
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:34,441
Starvation - too many people, too little food.

45
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,005
Until Salamander invented his Sun Store.
Surely you've heard? You must know?

46
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:39,885
Oh yes, well of course we've heard something.

47
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:44,513
The Sun Store collects the rays from the sun
and stores them in concentrated form.

48
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:46,296
Oh, like the ioniser, Doctor?

49
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:48,272
Yes, a rather different principle I think, Jamie.

50
00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:50,965
Well never mind how it works! What's it for?

51
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:55,429
Salamander can force-grow three,
sometimes four, crops in one summer.

52
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:59,095
Well why do these men want to kill him.
I mean, one minute you say he's saving the world, the next...

53
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:03,449
For his own ends! Step by step he's taking control of this planet.

54
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,038
You have proof of this?

55
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:19,300
Some, yes. I was once a high official in the World Zone Authority
- Deputy Security Leader for North Africa and Europe
- but Salamander discredited and ruined me
because he realized I was beginning to get suspicious.

56
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:22,479
But you could be making up stories about Salamander!
Out of revenge.

57
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:49,374
Yes, I suppose so. Then you can judge for yourself.
You remember Michael Assevski -
he was Controller of the Eastern European Zone?
He was drowned at sea a mile from shore.
Hockingham murdered!
All of them were seen with Salamander,
or a man known as his deputy, shortly before their deaths.

58
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:52,846
All of them were replaced by men known to be in Salamander's power.

59
00:09:53,022 --> 00:09:54,696
- Known by who?
- By me, Doctor.

60
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,257
Well why don't you tell the authorities, the police or whatever?

61
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:06,682
Because I'm discredited, don't you see?
Because Salamander is so popular,
and also because the man that took my place,
a man named Donald Bruce,
has since risen to become overall security chief.

62
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:08,311
Surely there is someone you can take your story to?

63
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:20,056
Ah yes, Helvig believed me.
So did Assevski, and they're dead.
However, there is one other man,
a man named Alexander Denes,
but none of them will do anything until it's too late!

64
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:27,107
I'm surprised.
Well if Salamander is everything you say he is,
then why hasn't he tried to...

65
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:28,086
Dispose of me?

66
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:28,808
Yes.

67
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:33,762
Well he has, but he's afraid.
You see, the testimony of a dead man still holds legal weight.

68
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:39,708
Oh, I see. Well, it seems we have a problem on our hands
whether to believe Mr Kent or not.

69
00:10:39,843 --> 00:10:41,513
Well there is one way that you can find out for yourselves.

70
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,323
Oh, how?

71
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:43,724
Impersonate Salamander.

72
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:45,974
Yes I thought that's what we were leading up to.

73
00:10:46,142 --> 00:10:47,985
Well I must admit, Doctor, you do look like him.

74
00:10:48,122 --> 00:10:48,926
Exactly like him.

75
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:50,741
Yes, there's more to it than that. What about the voice?

76
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:52,782
Well it's nearly the same pitch, only the accent.

77
00:10:52,922 --> 00:11:25,190
Only the accent! My dear young lady. Oh dear.
Now what was it he said...
We still cannot guarantee good summer holidays for all.
No. Guarantee... no, no, no... guaran... guarantee.
You see, it's very difficult.
Hmm, of course I always was interested in phonetics.
Holidays... summer... summer.
He must have come from Mexico, Quintana Roo or Yucatan or somewhere...

78
00:11:25,254 --> 00:11:28,529
That's incredible, Doctor, he was born at Merida,
state capital of Yucatan.

79
00:11:28,707 --> 00:11:36,248
Yes, there are other very strong influences though.
Oh, I could do it in time. But what if I did it, what then?

80
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:43,485
You could walk into Salamander's research station at Kanowa,
find out how he's getting control of the separate World Zones,
and then bring out absolute proof.

81
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:50,849
Yes. I see.

82
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:55,885
How long did you say it would take you to master Salamander's accent?

83
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:59,729
I didn't. It would take three weeks, perhaps four.

84
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:12,659
Well while we've been talking,
the Security Chief I told you about, Donald Bruce,
has since cordoned off this entire area.
He's coming here himself.
Now! I'd say you've got about two minutes, Doctor.

85
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:13,614
But that's out of the question!

86
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:16,858
You know what he'll do as soon as he sees you,
a man who resembles Salamander so closely?

87
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,072
Oh that's not fair!

88
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:23,105
Will you please listen! You'll be under arrest for
impersonation as soon as he sees you. I mean it.

89
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:24,854
But isn't there another way out of this?

90
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:26,657
Only one - be Salamander.

91
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:27,690
But the clothes!

92
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:32,420
Yes, there are some in here.
A little less eccentric, but do the best you can.

93
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:33,758
I won't! I can't!

94
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:36,919
Your friends, Doctor, do you want them to suffer?
Because they will, you know.

95
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:39,424
No, wait a minute! Why is a man like Bruce coming here?

96
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:40,889
Don't push me, there isn't time.

97
00:12:41,023 --> 00:12:43,063
You sent for him, didn't you? You tipped him off!

98
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:45,245
I couldn't miss an opportunity like this,
now please come on.

99
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,744
Giles, for heaven's sake, what have you done?
It's far too risky.

100
00:12:58,881 --> 00:13:04,140
Hello Kent. Doing some recruiting are you?
A bit young for killers, aren't they?

101
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:05,695
What do you mean?

102
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:07,552
All right, what do you mean by stepping in here like this?

103
00:13:07,717 --> 00:13:11,352
Anytime, Kent. I've got the right and you know it. Anytime I like.

104
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:15,189
All right, what do you want?

105
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:20,672
That's better, you're ex-security,
you know the way it's got to go.
We might as well be nice and civil about it, mightn't we?

106
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:26,268
That bungalow in Cedar District. In your name, right?

107
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:27,217
Why?

108
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:34,201
Do I have to tell you?
There's been an awful nasty mess out there.
Someone has got himself shot in your living room.

109
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:37,563
- And who are you two?
- Jamie McCrimmon

110
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:39,046
- And?
- Victoria Waterfield

111
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:41,386
- What's the matter, can't you speak?
- Don't shout at me.

112
00:13:41,731 --> 00:13:45,968
Oh, very good, the outraged public citizen. Do they know who I am?

113
00:13:46,115 --> 00:13:46,848
Yes they do.

114
00:13:46,969 --> 00:14:06,356
A pity, I like to hear you say it.
Now listen to this, all of you.
One of your men was murdered in a bungalow rented to you.
The remains of two others were found in what was left of a helicopter.
You were in that bungalow at the time.
And there were three other people with you, two youngsters and a man. Right?

115
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:13,463
Now, there was another man, wasn't there?
So we'll deal with that first? Where is he?

116
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:36,874
Why hello Bruce, what are you doing here, huh?
