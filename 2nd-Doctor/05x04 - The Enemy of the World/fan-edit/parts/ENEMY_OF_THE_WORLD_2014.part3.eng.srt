1
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:28,357
You've done very well so far, Fedorin.

2
00:28:28,647 --> 00:28:30,957
It's nothing but a blackmail.

3
00:28:31,027 --> 00:28:34,044
Blackmail? What have I threaten you with? Nothing!

4
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:36,198
No, but you would if I refused.

5
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:38,756
Fedorin, I keep on telling you,

6
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:43,762
this is just a form of comprehensive insurance, hm?

7
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:46,441
There's nothing for you to worry about.

8
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:50,998
My dear man, I've done nothing
but praise you ever since we first met.

9
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:55,638
I said you should be European Controller.
I said I would support you.

10
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:58,641
You've found out things about me,
lies that would damage me.

11
00:28:58,707 --> 00:29:00,925
On the contrary, I am doing you a good turn.

12
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:03,625
I am actually suppressing facts about you.

13
00:29:03,687 --> 00:29:08,145
- Lies, I tell you!
- Lies... Truth... Who knows?

14
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:12,405
But we wouldn't like to put them to the test, would we?

15
00:29:18,487 --> 00:29:20,478
There.

16
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:22,988
What's this?

17
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:28,681
Used in the right way, at the right time,
it can dictate your own future

18
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:31,725
and the future of Alexander Denes.

19
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:33,525
Poison?

20
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:34,698
I want you to take a message...

21
00:29:34,985 --> 00:29:39,998
- McCrimmon! What are you doing dressed like this?
- Leader's orders.

22
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:42,898
Now that you're here, I've got some questions
I want to ask you.

23
00:29:42,997 --> 00:29:44,456
I have better things to do, thank you.

24
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:47,137
I want to know what Salamander and Giles Kent
were discussing

25
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:50,237
- when I saw you last time?
- It's not for me to tell you that.

26
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:51,956
I am concerned of Salamander's safety.

27
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:53,956
Giles Kent is supposed to be his bitter enemy.

28
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:57,756
If Salamander wishes you to know that,
I dare say he'll tell you himself.

29
00:29:57,853 --> 00:29:59,732
You'll get no confidential out of me.

30
00:30:00,547 --> 00:30:03,652
Listen. You must go away from here.

31
00:30:03,747 --> 00:30:05,782
Don't get caught up in Salamander's world.

32
00:30:05,947 --> 00:30:08,940
Why? What do you mean?
You sound as if you don't like him.

33
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,106
- Like him? I ...
- Oh, hello there.

34
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,542
Finish writing those menus.

35
00:30:16,427 --> 00:30:18,183
- Did you hear that?
- Aye. Work on her.

36
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:20,156
I have a feeling she can tell us something about Salamander.

37
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:21,901
All right. As soon as I can.
What have you been doing?

38
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,056
I managed to slip out
and tell Astrid everything that's happened.

39
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,403
- You might have told me, Jamie!
- There wasn't time.

40
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:28,400
- She's trying to get Denes away.
- And take him to the Doctor?

41
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,400
- He'd believe Denes.
- Aye, he would.

42
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,927
How can she get in?
Salamander's got guards are everywhere.

43
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:34,899
She's got friends here.
They're going to arrange passes...

44
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:37,562
- and the right sort of uniform.
- What sort of uniform?

45
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,518
I don't know. Messenger delivery
or something. Ssh!

46
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:40,917
Controller Denes has been arrested.

47
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:46,917
I can't make up my mind whether Fedorin
is to be regarded as a new Controller or not.

48
00:30:47,087 --> 00:30:49,979
The burden of office is heavy, my friend.
I remember when I was...

49
00:30:50,007 --> 00:30:51,440
Alright. They've gone.

50
00:30:52,007 --> 00:30:55,606
Astrid and Giles Kent were quite right.
Salamander IS an evil man.

51
00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:59,355
- I can somehow sense it from all the people here.
- He's bad, all right.

52
00:30:59,447 --> 00:31:03,321
He's had Denes arrested,
and has Fedorin eating out of his hand.

53
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,841
Why should he do that?

54
00:31:04,987 --> 00:31:07,241
Remove the honest man, and put a weaker man in his place

55
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:11,082
but somehow have a hold on him,
That way Salamander can take over the territory.

56
00:31:11,247 --> 00:31:15,081
I see - when everything's in a turmoil
because of the earthquakes.

57
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:17,363
Aye, and that's lucky to say the least.

58
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:24,237
But you don't really believe that Salamander
could cause earthquakes, do you?

59
00:31:40,187 --> 00:31:42,780
I'm certain Salamander's causing the earthquakes, Doctor

60
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:45,580
and I'm sure your friends Jamie and Victoria
will tell you how bad he really is.

61
00:31:45,747 --> 00:31:47,465
But why make earthquakes?

62
00:31:47,627 --> 00:31:52,060
Years ago, when one country wanted to invade another,
it set about attacking the confidence of that country,

63
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:54,906
throwing it into confusion, making it weak.
Then it was right for take over.

64
00:31:55,053 --> 00:31:56,906
Now, isn't that exactly what's happening here,
only in a different way?

65
00:31:57,067 --> 00:32:00,478
What you're saying is that Salamander has found a way...

66
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,774
...to harness the natural forces of the Earth.

67
00:32:02,947 --> 00:32:07,896
That's a little difficult to accept.
I'm not saying it's impossible, mind you.

68
00:32:09,347 --> 00:32:14,785
You say it's coming from the research station.
Salamander's research station, eh?

69
00:32:14,947 --> 00:32:17,700
That's what I believe, in spite of...
Ssh! Wait a minute.

70
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:24,500
In spite of a number of reasons,
he invented the sun-store, a brilliant advance.

71
00:32:24,597 --> 00:32:27,453
He found a way of directing conserved energy
to areas starved of sun.

72
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:30,823
- What made you suspicious?
- The money he was spending ast the Research Station

73
00:32:30,987 --> 00:32:33,560
The materials involved, the food stores.
It didn't make sense.

74
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:37,032
- I had all the papers, all the requisition orders.
- But that's valuable evidence!

75
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:40,503
All destroyed, and new ones appeared...
I was made out to be the criminal!

76
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,996
All by suggestion, of course. I was discredited.

77
00:32:43,287 --> 00:32:45,838
I couldn't do it, Salamander. I couldn't do it.

78
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,919
I stood there with this man's life in my hands.

79
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:51,521
This powder - I couldn't use it.

80
00:32:51,687 --> 00:32:55,157
I gave you the chance
to become something. Somebody.

81
00:32:55,327 --> 00:32:58,558
- You failed to take it, huh
- There must be some other way.

82
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:03,601
Of course, my friend. Don't worry.

83
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:05,678
- What?  - Don't worry.

84
00:33:05,847 --> 00:33:07,840
You try, you fail - so what?

85
00:33:07,947 --> 00:33:09,940
The moon doesn't fall out of the sky!

86
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:13,124
Come and sit down. Have a drink, huh?

87
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:17,443
Cheer up. We'll find another way.

88
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:19,279
I really did try.

89
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:20,960
Of course you did.

90
00:33:21,427 --> 00:33:22,719
Don't worry.

91
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:24,957
Forget it, huh?

92
00:33:25,127 --> 00:33:27,721
I have an alternative.

93
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:30,280
Your health.

94
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:37,160
I hope you will appreciate this wine.
It's made for me especially in Alaska.

95
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:49,602
One chance, my friend.

96
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:51,917
I said one chance!

97
00:33:52,087 --> 00:33:53,823
Some trouble in the kitchens, Leader.

98
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:55,703
The new man says he's seen
someone in the kitchen gardens.

99
00:33:55,787 --> 00:33:58,603
Very well. Oh, see to that, will you?

100
00:33:58,807 --> 00:34:01,603
Suicide, of course. Such a pity.

101
00:34:03,647 --> 00:34:06,844
- I can't see anything.
- Over there by the trees!

102
00:34:07,007 --> 00:34:09,186
He's armed, too. Get down!

103
00:34:09,207 --> 00:34:10,886
I'm going out there. Stay down here.

104
00:34:11,047 --> 00:34:13,642
When the rest of the guards come,
send them after me.

105
00:34:13,747 --> 00:34:14,642
Yes, all right.

106
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:23,363
Astrid's going to get you away.

107
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:27,136
An attempt has been made to rescue this man.
Take him out to the car.

108
00:34:28,987 --> 00:34:30,286
I'm sorry, Janos.

109
00:34:30,747 --> 00:34:31,780
Stop!

110
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:35,984
After them! Arrest that girl!

111
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:38,440
Well, we all seem to be here,

112
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:41,368
except the third member of your escape committee.

113
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:45,960
- What are you talking about?
- You were seen speaking with a girl in the park.

114
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:48,103
The one who tried to escape with Denes.

115
00:34:48,197 --> 00:34:51,147
We don't know anything about that.
We don't even know her.

116
00:34:51,317 --> 00:34:55,796
A diversion was caused.
There was no one outside the kitchen.

117
00:34:55,957 --> 00:34:57,906
Of course there was someone, and there was shooting.

118
00:34:58,077 --> 00:35:02,116
Three shots have been fired from this gun.
It's yours, isn't it?

119
00:35:02,277 --> 00:35:05,155
Pretending to save my life was ingenious,

120
00:35:05,317 --> 00:35:09,754
but ingenuity requires a constant stream of new ideas.

121
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:12,795
Yours seem to have dried up.

122
00:35:14,477 --> 00:35:19,346
I come to the Central Zone.
An attempt is made on my life.

123
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,906
Denes proves to be a traitor.

124
00:35:22,077 --> 00:35:25,149
Fedorin commits suicide because I uncover him.

125
00:35:25,317 --> 00:35:28,753
Do your job, Bruce.
You can see they're all in this.

126
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:32,147
All right. Take them away.

127
00:35:32,317 --> 00:35:34,626
Take your hands off me!

128
00:35:34,797 --> 00:35:37,231
Salamander, I think you should tell me what's going on.

129
00:35:37,397 --> 00:35:39,516
One minute I see you with this lad McCrimmon,

130
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:41,779
- you're working together. The next minute...
- I thought he saved my life.

131
00:35:41,877 --> 00:35:45,226
No, I mean before that. In Kent's office.

132
00:35:47,877 --> 00:35:50,414
- What are you talking about?
- Well I saw you there.

133
00:35:50,537 --> 00:35:52,631
But I haven't seen Kent in months.

134
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:56,031
Yes, you were with Kent, Fariah and the youngsters.

135
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:59,812
I thought it was so curious,
I spoke to your number two, Benik, about it.

136
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:04,229
- That's really the reason I came to this zone.
- But I tell you...

137
00:36:04,397 --> 00:36:08,072
I must get back to the research centre.
You will come with me.

138
00:36:08,237 --> 00:36:10,228
It was you!

139
00:36:11,677 --> 00:36:15,465
Or someone... like you?
