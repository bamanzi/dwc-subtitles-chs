1
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:30,757
- You've done very well so far, Fedorin.
- It's nothing more than blackmail.

2
00:28:30,927 --> 00:28:34,044
Blackmail? I have threatened you with nothing.

3
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:36,198
No, but you would if I refused.

4
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:38,756
Fedorin, I keep on telling you,

5
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:43,762
this is just a form
of comprehensive insurance, hm?

6
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:46,441
There's nothing for you to worry about.

7
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:50,998
My dear man, I've done nothing
but praise you ever since we first met.

8
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:55,638
I said you should be European Controller.
I said I would support you.

9
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:58,641
You've found out things about me,
lies that would damage me.

10
00:28:58,707 --> 00:29:03,625
On the contrary, I am doing you a good turn.
I am actually suppressing facts about you.

11
00:29:03,687 --> 00:29:06,885
- Lies, I tell you!
- Lies... Truth...

12
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:12,405
Who knows? But we wouldn't like
to put him to the test, would we?

13
00:29:18,487 --> 00:29:20,478
There.

14
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,438
What's this?

15
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:28,681
Used in the right way, at the right time,
it can dictate your own future

16
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:31,725
and the future of Alexander Denes.

17
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:33,525
Poison...

18
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:39,398
I want you to take a message... McCrimmon!
What are you doing dressed like this?

19
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:42,798
- Leader's orders.
- I've got some questions for you.

20
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:44,456
I have better things to do, thank you.

21
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:48,837
I want to know what Salamander and Giles Kent
were discussing when I saw you last time?

22
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:53,956
- It's not for me to tell you that.
- I am concerned of Salamander's safety.
Giles Kent is Salamander's bitter enemy. fixme

23
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:58,086
If Salamander wishes you to know that,
I dare say he'll tell you himself.

24
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:05,882
Listen. You must go away from here.
Don't get caught up in Salamander's world.

25
00:30:06,047 --> 00:30:10,040
- Why? You sound as if you don't like him.
- Like him?

26
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:11,606
Hello there.

27
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:14,042
Finish writing those menus.

28
00:30:16,127 --> 00:30:19,483
- Did you hear that?
- Get her to talk about Salamander.

29
00:30:19,647 --> 00:30:23,401
- All right. As soon as I can.
- I told Astrid what's happened.

30
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:27,003
- You might have told me!
- She's trying to get Denes away.

31
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:30,000
And take him to the Doctor?
He'd believe Denes.

32
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:32,727
How can she get in? Guards are everywhere.

33
00:30:32,887 --> 00:30:35,799
Her friends are giving her passes and a uniform.

34
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,118
- What sort of uniform?
- Messenger delivery. Ssh!

35
00:30:40,487 --> 00:30:46,517
I don't know whether Fedorin
is to be regarded as a new Controller or not.

36
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:49,679
The burden of office is heavy, my friend.

37
00:30:50,407 --> 00:30:51,840
They've gone.

38
00:30:52,007 --> 00:30:55,636
Astrid and Giles Kent were right.
Salamander IS an evil man.

39
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:59,595
- I can sense it from all the people here.
- He's bad, all right.

40
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:03,521
He's had Denes arrested,
and has Fedorin eating out of his hand.

41
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:07,441
- Why do that?
- Replace an honest man with a weaker man,

42
00:31:07,607 --> 00:31:11,282
but somehow have a hold on him,
and take over the territory.

43
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:15,281
I see - when everything's in a turmoil
because of the earthquakes.

44
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:17,563
And that's lucky to say the least.

45
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:24,437
But you don't really believe that Salamander
could cause earthquakes, do you?

46
00:31:40,387 --> 00:31:45,780
I'm certain Salamander's behind this.
Jamie and Victoria will tell you how bad he is.

47
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:47,665
But why make earthquakes?

48
00:31:47,827 --> 00:31:53,060
Years ago, if a country wanted to invade
another, it threw that country into confusion,

49
00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:57,106
making it weak and ripe for take-over.
That's happening here.

50
00:31:57,267 --> 00:32:02,978
You're saying Salamander has found a way
to harness the natural forces of the Earth.

51
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:08,096
That's difficult to accept.
I'm not saying it's impossible, mind you.

52
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:14,985
You say it's coming from the research station.
Salamander's research station, eh?

53
00:32:15,147 --> 00:32:17,900
That's what I believe, in spite of... Ssh!

54
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:23,900
In spite of the fact he invented the sun-store

55
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,503
and directed conserved energy
to areas starved of sun.

56
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:31,023
- What made you suspicious?
- The money he was spending.

57
00:32:31,187 --> 00:32:35,260
The materials and food.
It didn't match the requisition orders.

58
00:32:35,427 --> 00:32:38,703
- That's valuable evidence.
- New orders appeared.

59
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:42,496
I was made out to be the criminal -
by suggestion, of course.

60
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:46,038
I couldn't do it, Salamander. I couldn't do it.

61
00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:49,119
I stood there with this man's life in my hands.

62
00:32:49,287 --> 00:32:51,721
This powder - I couldn't use it.

63
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:55,357
I gave you the chance
to become something. Somebody.

64
00:32:55,527 --> 00:32:58,758
- You failed to take it.
- There must be some other way.

65
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:03,801
Of course, my friend. Don't worry.

66
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:05,878
- What?
- Don't worry.

67
00:33:06,047 --> 00:33:10,040
You try, you fail - so what?
The moon doesn't fall out of the sky!

68
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:13,324
Come and sit down. Have a drink, huh?

69
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:17,643
Cheer up. We'll find another way.

70
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:19,479
I really did try.

71
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:21,160
Of course you did.

72
00:33:21,327 --> 00:33:22,919
Don't worry.

73
00:33:23,087 --> 00:33:25,157
Forget it, huh?

74
00:33:25,327 --> 00:33:27,921
I have an alternative.

75
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:30,480
Your health.

76
00:33:32,047 --> 00:33:37,360
I hope you will appreciate this wine.
It's made for me especially in Alaska.

77
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:49,802
One chance, my friend.

78
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:52,117
I said one chance!

79
00:33:52,287 --> 00:33:55,723
The new man says he's seen someone
in the kitchen gardens.

80
00:33:55,887 --> 00:34:01,803
Very well. Oh, see to that, will you?
Suicide, of course. Such a pity.

81
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:07,044
- I can't see anything.
- Over there by the trees!

82
00:34:07,207 --> 00:34:11,086
He's armed, too. Get down!
I'm going out there. Stay down here.

83
00:34:11,247 --> 00:34:14,842
When the rest of the guards come,
send them after me.

84
00:34:20,807 --> 00:34:22,763
Astrid's going to get you away.

85
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:26,636
An attempt has been made to rescue this man.
Take him to the car.

86
00:34:27,887 --> 00:34:29,286
I'm sorry, Janos.

87
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:30,880
Stop!

88
00:34:31,647 --> 00:34:34,684
After them! Arrest that girl!

89
00:34:34,847 --> 00:34:37,520
Well, we all seem to be here,

90
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:40,918
except the third member
of your escape committee.

91
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:45,080
- What are you talking about?
- You were seen with a girl in the park.

92
00:34:45,247 --> 00:34:49,957
- The one who tried to escape with Denes.
- We don't even know her.

93
00:34:50,627 --> 00:34:52,106
A diversion was caused.

94
00:34:52,267 --> 00:34:57,216
- There was no one outside the kitchen.
- There was, and there was shooting.

95
00:34:57,387 --> 00:35:01,426
Three shots have been fired from this gun.
It's yours, isn't it?

96
00:35:01,587 --> 00:35:04,465
Pretending to save my life was ingenious,

97
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:09,064
but ingenuity requires
a constant stream of new ideas.

98
00:35:09,227 --> 00:35:12,105
Yours seem to have dried up.

99
00:35:13,787 --> 00:35:18,656
I come to the Central Zone.
An attempt is made on my life.

100
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:21,216
Denes proves to be a traitor.

101
00:35:21,387 --> 00:35:24,459
Fedorin commits suicide because I uncover him.

102
00:35:24,627 --> 00:35:28,063
Do your job, Bruce.
You can see they're all in this.

103
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,457
All right. Take them away.

104
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:33,936
Take your hands off me!

105
00:35:34,107 --> 00:35:36,541
I think you should tell me what's going on.

106
00:35:36,707 --> 00:35:39,426
One minute you're working with McCrimmon...

107
00:35:39,587 --> 00:35:44,536
- I thought he saved my life.
- I mean before that. In Kent's office.

108
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,224
- What are you talking about?
- I saw you there.

109
00:35:50,387 --> 00:35:55,541
- I haven't seen Kent in months.
- You were with him, Fariah and the youngsters.

110
00:35:55,707 --> 00:35:59,222
I thought it was so curious,
I spoke to Benik about it.

111
00:35:59,387 --> 00:36:03,539
- That's the reason I came to this zone.
- But I tell you...

112
00:36:03,707 --> 00:36:07,382
I must get back to the research centre.
You will come with me.

113
00:36:07,547 --> 00:36:09,538
It was you.

114
00:36:10,987 --> 00:36:14,775
Or someone like you.
