1
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:34,737
Hello Bruce, what are you doing here, eh?

2
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:39,677
I was under the impression
you were in the Central European Zone, Leader.

3
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:43,483
That's what you were meant to believe.

4
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:44,342
Why?

5
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,452
I do not care to be questioned by my own security!

6
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:55,003
Well that's just it. How can I possibly maintain security
when you behave like this? I'm at least entitled to know your movements.

7
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:58,209
You have a policeman's mind, Bruce.

8
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:06,116
That may be! Only a few days ago you questioned me
about this man and his activities.
And we agreed that he was dangerous!
Now, I find you in his office.

9
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:12,654
Sometimes I like to deal with matters in my own way.

10
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:16,615
They're not holding you here?

11
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,371
Holding me?

12
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:18,449
Under some threat or other.

13
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:20,475
No one threatens Salamander!

14
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:23,032
I still think I deserve an explanation, Leader.

15
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:31,526
Yes, of course, you shall have it. But not now.
When I return from the Central European Zone.

16
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,080
Very well.

17
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:41,254
Now what about the dead man found in your bungalow.
He was one of your lot, wasn't he?

18
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:45,923
Yes. Um, he was trying to protect me.
The other two wanted to kill me.

19
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:49,404
Now why should they want to do that
to a nice young girl like you?

20
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:50,629
Well I...

21
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,881
Obviously they thought I was there.

22
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:55,716
You?

23
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,317
Yes, Bruce, just like you,
a lot of people don't like me.

24
00:15:58,481 --> 00:16:01,551
Don't get clever with me, Kent!
I've a good mind to...

25
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,452
I am prepared to accept his story.

26
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:04,786
Well I'm not!

27
00:16:05,024 --> 00:16:09,122
That's interesting, but not important. 
I accept it! That's all that matters.

28
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:12,677
It's beginning to look as if these people
are working for you now. Is that right?

29
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:23,903
You still dare to question me!
They have information! I shall get it! /19.1
I will see you on my return. Now leave me!

30
00:16:28,127 --> 00:16:29,110
McCrimmon, you said?

31
00:16:29,182 --> 00:16:29,641
Aye.

32
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,367
Well you just watch your step, that's all.

33
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:39,125
I never said a word.

34
00:16:42,505 --> 00:16:44,339
Must be the way you look, Jamie.

35
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:45,932
You were splendid, Doctor.

36
00:16:46,164 --> 00:16:46,813
Thank you.

37
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,089
That was a dangerous game to play.

38
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:52,040
It paid off. All right, are you with us?

39
00:16:53,529 --> 00:17:06,873
I don't know where you stand, Mr Kent. /55.5
But you and this Salamander are obviously 
on opposite sides. That at least is clear. /01.5
But which side is good? Which side is bad? 
And why should I interfere?

40
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:09,978
Well you're the only man who can help save the world.

41
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,623
But isn't that what Salamander's trying to do?

42
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:14,136
Don't you understand? Salamander...

43
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:17,371
Just a moment. Jamie, you're unusually quiet, what do you think?

44
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:24,427
Well to save the world, aye, well it sounds grand, but... /20.0
Oh, we couldn't turn our back on a challenge like this Doctor. 
Well, at least I know you wouldn't.

45
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:26,620
We don't know anything about these people.

46
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,700
Astrid saved our lives. She was wounded because of it.

47
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:29,756
- Oh but Jamie, you don't think...
- Look, she was...

48
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:34,358
Look we're right about Salamander! 
It won't take you long to find out for yourselves.

49
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:35,923
How do you propose we do that?

50
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:37,723
He'll be well guarded for a start.

51
00:17:37,904 --> 00:17:40,148
We can hardly steal into his study and go through his papers.

52
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,691
That man, Bruce, said that he was in the Central European Zone.

53
00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:45,436
It's a long way from Australia.

54
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:47,052
It's only two hours by rocket.

55
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,627
You could leave almost at once.

56
00:17:48,807 --> 00:17:49,821
Oh, what then?

57
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:56,585
I've had a plan for infiltrating into
Salamander's inner circle for some time. /54.0
Well I could adapt it for your two friends.

58
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:59,847
I can arrange three travel warrants and visas.
Everything you need.

59
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:01,158
Just three?

60
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,665
Well one for Astrid, one for you and ah...

61
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:04,485
- Victoria.
- Of course.

62
00:18:05,443 --> 00:18:09,841
Oh that's very clever of you. How can you do that?
I thought you said you had no official position?

63
00:18:11,111 --> 00:18:12,321
We have a contact there.

64
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:14,638
He must be a very important person.

65
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:17,937
He is. Denes, Controller of the Zone.

66
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:23,628
Oh, I see. What about me?

67
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:27,469
I think we better have a look at
Salamander's research station at Kanowa.

68
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:31,925
Yes. Ah, yes, but from a safe distance of course.

69
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,211
This is dreadful news, Salamander.
I still can't believe it.

70
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:37,676
Terrible, terrible.

71
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:47,961
I don't say it will happen. I say it can happen.
Your Zone is in danger, Denes. Here, here and here.

72
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:50,319
We've had no trouble for years in those mountains.

73
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,637
You don't imagine I make it up?

74
00:18:51,787 --> 00:18:52,488
No, no, of course not.

75
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:57,840
Those volcanoes have been dead since sixteenth century.
Fedorin is right to doubt.

76
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:16,473
A volcano is a strange thing, my friend. I tell you the truth. /03.2
It's like a man in the hot sun, sleeping... still... lifeless. /09.6
Then boom! He wakes full of energy! I know volcanoes.

77
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:20,975
Isn't there a possibility of a... miscalculation for a few degrees.

78
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:24,836
I'm never wrong. Every one of my predictions has been accurate.

79
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:29,123
Yes. You're record is good. I don't deny that.

80
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,697
You are too kind. Now will you listen to me!

81
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:34,056
Leader, the communications...

82
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,779
I know! I know! I told you I was not to be disturbed!

83
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:37,971
Yes, Leader.

84
00:19:38,158 --> 00:19:44,577
No, wait! No, wait Fariah, ah? 

85
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:48,239
- You like some refreshment, perhaps?
- Thank you.

86
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:49,792
No, no, not for me.

87
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:50,969
You're going so soon?

88
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:53,932
I must consult my scientific advisors.

89
00:19:54,097 --> 00:19:55,669
You still don't believe me?

90
00:19:55,869 --> 00:20:02,884
I believe you sufficiently to want to...
have your information checked. /59.7
Before I alarm my people unnecessarily.

91
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:07,317
Your scientists won't help you.
They don't know. They are amateurs.

92
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:16,459
No, Salamander, they are not amateurs.
They are very clever men dedicated to their work. /12.5
But they are men, capable of human error like anybody else.

93
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,491
Do what you wish. Captain!

94
00:20:20,298 --> 00:20:20,979
Sir!

95
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:22,659
Controller Denes is leaving.

96
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:23,652
Yes, sir.

97
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:32,939
You will soon see that I am right.
Oh, you will stay, ah? Have a drink./29.0
We have a great deal to talk about, you and I.
Fariah, see to him.

98
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,368
That might be her now. Yes.

99
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:41,518
Hello, Giles? This is me, Astrid.

100
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:42,823
Right lets have it. What's happening?

101
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:45,171
Everything's gone fine so far.

102
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,861
And the rocket arrived right on time in Hungary. 
And Jamie's got his entrance pass and has started phase one.

103
00:20:50,946 --> 00:20:52,125
Do you think the boy can handle it?

104
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:56,429
Well I hope so. My goodness they're a pretty odd lot though, aren't they?

105
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:58,350
Well actually the Doctor's with me right now.

106
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:02,213
Oh, I am sorry. Oh I know... I'm sure they'll be fine.

107
00:21:02,556 --> 00:21:06,267
What news of Denes? We must keep him posted as to what is happening.

108
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,159
It's all right, we've contacted and we've arranged to meet.

109
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:11,048
Be careful, he's pretty well known.

110
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:13,409
But what on earth made you
take a job as a food taster?

111
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:21,548
She was hungry. Only thing is, now she has all the food she needs, she has lost her appetite. Give me a drink!

112
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:23,188
You are well protected.

113
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:24,234
Um.

114
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:32,835
Very well protected. Be calm. Sit down, drink your drink.

115
00:21:33,098 --> 00:21:35,400
Ah! Gua...

116
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:41,360
Thank you for calling the guard. I was wondering what to do about him.

117
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:58,561
Now don't move for that box! Not if you value your life. /44.3
Now all of you, back over there! That's it. /48.5
Not as well protected as you think you are, eh? /52.7
Now when I say duck... Duck, get down!

118
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:38,543
Look at this! What do you do boys, eh? Read? Sleep? It's a fine thing./20.7
Here we have an attempt to destroy me and where are you? /23.6
It's not so good, boys. It's not so good. I'm watching you. /27.5
Look after him. Better still get rid of him. /33.0
/36.5What's all this about. Eh?

119
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:45,392
I heard two men talking. They said they'd planted a bomb of some kind in your radio telephone. /43.2
I tried to warn them at the gates, but they wouldn't pay any attention.

120
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:48,004
So you break in? How you break in?

121
00:22:47,718 --> 00:22:53,071
Well I'm here on holiday with a friend. She's very pretty, so the guard didn't see me slip past him.

122
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:57,436
Why didn't you call out and warn me? I nearly used the radio telephone several times.

123
00:22:57,649 --> 00:22:59,032
Ah you'd have had me shot, most like.

124
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,707
Why do you risk your skin to save me?

125
00:23:03,085 --> 00:23:05,797
Well without you the Earth hasn't much of a chance, has it?

126
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:14,749
You like to work for me, eh? You like that?

127
00:23:14,913 --> 00:23:16,898
Oh no, you don't have to do that. I mean, you owe me nothing.

128
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,216
You're quite right, boy.

129
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,658
And I'm on holiday.

130
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,661
You won't find what I pay you disappointing.

131
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:24,584
Aye, there's my girlfriend too though.

132
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,017
Oh we might be able to find something for her. Eh Fariah?

133
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,902
Yes, your chef could use an assistant.

134
00:23:29,998 --> 00:23:31,360
See to it. What do you say, eh?

135
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:36,676
Well I'll give it a go. But I'll say this though,
your security system's rotten. There'll have to be changes.

136
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:42,579
Oh what a boy, ah? Fariah, see he gets some proper uniform instead of this skirt.

137
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:45,297
And bring him and his girlfriend to see me.

138
00:23:45,497 --> 00:23:46,726
Come along then.

139
00:23:49,635 --> 00:23:52,416
What an extraordinary young man.

140
00:23:52,627 --> 00:24:00,446
I prize loyalty very highly, my friend.
And I repay it very generously. /57.5
Like I do the girl Fariah, eh.

141
00:24:17,012 --> 00:24:20,055
I used to love to do this sort of thing when I was a boy.

142
00:24:20,364 --> 00:24:22,663
I'm sorry. It was the safest place I could think of.

143
00:24:22,802 --> 00:24:24,378
Oh, it's all right. I'm still fit enough.

144
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,834
Thank you for getting me the necessary documents.

145
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:29,663
Have you been successful?

146
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:31,545
So far. Salamander's swallowed it.

147
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:32,880
I thought he would.

148
00:24:33,045 --> 00:24:35,700
The boy's very confident. The girl, not so much.

149
00:24:35,815 --> 00:24:45,705
See, the point is that I'm near enough to him to pick out something. /39.7
This was the first time I met Salamander. 
I must say that you were right about him, Astrid. /45.7

150
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,200
- We must get rid of him. He must be stopped.
- He will be stopped! /49.2

151
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:53,445
I'm returning to Giles Kent. 
Can you wait till we can take action?

152
00:24:54,397 --> 00:24:56,691
Oh, with a bit of luck, yes.

153
00:24:57,951 --> 00:25:01,770
Fedorin, would he betray you in some way?

154
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:05,295
I'm trying to think of some reason why he should.

155
00:25:05,597 --> 00:25:08,726
But these are all lies, Salamander. Lies, I assure you.

156
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,891
So you say.

157
00:25:09,997 --> 00:25:12,795
What are you going to do? My family... my friends.

158
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:36,907
My dear man. My dear Fedorin. You don't suppose 
I intend to make your swindling public, eh? /25.2
This is... this just an insurance, um. Sit down, forget it. 
I tell you what I'm going to do for you.

159
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:38,039
What?

160
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:45,654
You are going to replace Denes as controller of this Zone./42.2
But, don't say anything. I'll know you'll accept.

161
00:25:46,227 --> 00:25:47,718
What do you want?

162
00:25:48,908 --> 00:25:59,668
I'll tell you. There will be disaster in this Zone. /52.5
I cannot stop the disaster, but I can come 
to the aid of this Zone when it's happened.

163
00:25:59,817 --> 00:26:03,752
And take over? I see. The Zone would be yours!

164
00:26:03,908 --> 00:26:12,716
Oh ours, Fedorin, ours. It's a partnership I'm offering you. /07.8
Either you have half of everything, or you have nothing.

165
00:26:12,764 --> 00:26:14,357
But there's Alexander Denes.

166
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:18,572
Oh yes, the popular, well beloved Denes.

167
00:26:18,948 --> 00:26:22,073
- What a pity.
- Pity?

168
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:30,040
Oh didn't I tell you, Denes is going to die. 
Mysteriously... an assassin... terrible.

169
00:26:31,845 --> 00:26:34,251
I can't do that! You can't ask me!

170
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:37,537
I think I can ask you to do anything I want.

171
00:26:40,293 --> 00:27:12,935
My predictions are accurate! 
/48.5The entire Eperjes-Tokaj Ranges are in eruption! /53.0
/03.5Fedorin, come and look. It's very pretty. 
The history of Hungary is about to be rewritten!

172
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:16,592
Salamander.

173
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,288
What are you doing here, Bruce?

174
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:20,594
I had a report there was trouble here, an attempt on your life.

175
00:27:20,695 --> 00:27:22,175
It was nothing. Come and look.

176
00:27:37,677 --> 00:27:40,978
Terrible. Those poor people.

177
00:27:41,197 --> 00:27:44,026
Salamander! What have you done?

178
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:45,653
I warned you!

179
00:27:45,785 --> 00:27:49,743
You couldn't have known! You've done this somehow yourself!

180
00:27:50,927 --> 00:28:04,458
The man is mad! Worse still he is incompetent!/53.5
I warned this man that this zone was 
in danger of natural disaster and he did nothing! /59.1
Issued no cautions to the public. 
You deliberately allowed your people to suffer and die!/03
You're a traitor!

181
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:07,909
You're a traitor! You contrived this for your own ends.

182
00:28:08,077 --> 00:28:10,870
Bruce, I order you to arrest this man.

183
00:28:13,653 --> 00:28:18,388
But this is nonsense. Fedorin, you were here. 
You know this is nonsense.

184
00:28:18,648 --> 00:28:24,662
Denes you are too naive. At your trial, 
Fedorin will be the chief witness against you!
