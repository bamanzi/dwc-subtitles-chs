1
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:34,737
Hello Bruce, what are you doing here, eh?

2
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:40,077
I was under the impression
you were in the Central European Zone, Leader.

3
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:43,483
That's what you were meant to believe.

4
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:44,342
Why?

5
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,452
I do not care to be questioned by my own security!

6
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:52,903
Well that's just it. How can I possibly
maintain security when you behave like this?

7
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,003
I'm at least entitled to know your movements.

8
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:58,209
You have a policeman's mind, Bruce.

9
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:02,516
That may be! Only a few days ago you questioned me
about this man and his activities.

10
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:06,116
And we agreed that he was dangerous!
Now, I find you in his office.

11
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:12,654
Sometimes I like to deal with matters in my own way.

12
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:16,615
- They're not holding you here?  - Holding me?

13
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:18,449
Under some threat or other.

14
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:20,475
No one threatens Salamander!

15
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:23,032
I still think I deserve an explanation, Leader.

16
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:26,526
Yes, of course, you shall have it.

17
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:31,526
But not now. When I return from the Central European Zone.

18
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,080
Very well.

19
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,254
Now what about the dead man found in your bungalow.

20
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,254
He was one of your lot, wasn't he?

21
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:45,923
Yes. Um, he was trying to protect me.
The other two wanted to kill me.

22
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:49,404
Now why should they want to do that
to a nice young girl like you?

23
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:50,629
Well I...

24
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,881
Obviously they thought I was there.

25
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:55,616
You?

26
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:57,817
Yes, Bruce, just like you,
a lot of people don't like me.

27
00:15:57,911 --> 00:16:01,551
Don't get clever with me, Kent!
I've a good mind to...

28
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,352
I am prepared to accept his story.

29
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:04,686
Well I'm not!

30
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:07,022
That's interesting, but not important.

31
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:09,022
I accept it! That's all that matters.

32
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:12,577
It's beginning to look as if these people
are working for you now. Is that right?

33
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:19,003
You still dare to question me!
They have information! I shall get it!

34
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,803
I will see you on my return. Now leave me!

35
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:29,540
- McCrimmon, you said?  - Aye

36
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,267
Well you just watch your step, that's all.

37
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:39,025
I never said a word.

38
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:44,239
Must be the way you look, Jamie.

39
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:45,832
You were splendid, Doctor.

40
00:16:46,064 --> 00:16:46,713
Thank you.

41
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,989
That was a dangerous game to play.

42
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:52,440
It paid off. All right, are you with us?

43
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,373
I don't know where you stand, Mr Kent.

44
00:16:55,429 --> 00:17:01,473
But you and this Salamander are obviously
on opposite sides. That at least is clear.

45
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:06,773
But which side is good? Which side is bad?
And why should I interfere?

46
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:09,878
Well you're the only man who can help save the world.

47
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:12,523
But isn't that what Salamander's trying to do?

48
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:14,036
Don't you understand? Salamander...

49
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:17,271
Just a moment. Jamie, you're unusually quiet,
what do you think?

50
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:19,927
Well to save the world,
aye, well it sounds grand, but...

51
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,827
Oh, we couldn't turn our back
on a challenge like this, Doctor.

52
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:24,327
Well, at least I know you wouldn't.

53
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:26,520
We don't know anything about these people.

54
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,680
Astrid saved our lives.
She was wounded because of it.

55
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:30,206
- Oh but Jamie, you don't think...
- Look, she was...

56
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:32,058
Look, we're right about Salamander!

57
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:34,258
It won't take you long to find out for yourselves.

58
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:35,823
How do you propose we do that?

59
00:17:36,018 --> 00:17:37,623
He'll be well guarded for a start.

60
00:17:37,804 --> 00:17:40,048
We can hardly steal into his study
and go through his papers.

61
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:43,591
That man, Bruce, said that
he was in the Central European Zone.

62
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:45,336
It's a long way from Australia.

63
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:46,952
It's only two hours by rocket.

64
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,527
You could leave almost at once.

65
00:17:48,707 --> 00:17:50,721
- Oh, what then?  - I've had a plan ...

66
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:53,885
... for infiltrating into Salamander's
inner circle for some time.

67
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:56,485
Well I could adapt it for your two friends.

68
00:17:56,671 --> 00:17:59,747
I can arrange three travel warrants and visas.
Everything you need.

69
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:01,058
Just three?

70
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:03,365
Well one for Astrid, one for you and ah...

71
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:04,185
- Victoria.  - Of course.

72
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:07,641
Oh that's very clever of you.
How can you do that?

73
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,841
I thought you said you had no official position?

74
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:12,021
We have a contact there.

75
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:14,338
He must be a very important person.

76
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:17,637
He is. Denes, Controller of the Zone.

77
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:23,328
Oh, I see. What about me?

78
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:27,169
I think we better have a look at
Salamander's research station at Kanowa.

79
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:31,625
Yes. Ah, yes, but from a safe distance of course.

80
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,911
This is dreadful news, Salamander.
I still can't believe it.

81
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:37,376
Terrible, terrible.

82
00:18:37,903 --> 00:18:41,661
I don't say it will happen.
I say it can happen.

83
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:47,661
Your Zone is in danger, Denes.
Here, here and here.

84
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:50,019
We've had no trouble for years in those mountains.

85
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,337
You don't imagine I make it up?

86
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:52,188
No, no, of course not.

87
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:57,540
Those volcanoes have been dead
since sixteenth century. Fedorin is right to doubt.

88
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:02,973
A volcano is a strange thing, my friend.
I tell you the truth.

89
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:09,373
It's like a man in the hot sun,
sleeping... still... lifeless.

90
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:15,973
Then boom! He wakes full of energy!
I know volcanoes.

91
00:19:16,045 --> 00:19:20,675
Isn't there a possibility of a...
miscalculation for a few degrees?

92
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:24,536
I'm never wrong.
Every one of my predictions has been accurate.

93
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:28,823
Yes. You're record is good. I don't deny that.

94
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,397
You are too kind. Now will you listen to me!

95
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:33,756
Leader, the communications...

96
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:36,479
I know! I know! I told you I was not to be disturbed!

97
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:37,671
Yes, Leader.

98
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:44,277
No, wait! No, wait, Fariah, ah?

99
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:47,939
- You like some refreshment, perhaps?
- Thank you.

100
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:49,492
No, no, not for me.

101
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,669
You're going so soon?

102
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:53,632
I must consult my scientific advisors.

103
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:55,369
You still don't believe me?

104
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,384
I believe you sufficiently to want to...
have your information checked.

105
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:02,584
Before I alarm my people unnecessarily.

106
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:07,417
Your scientists won't help you.
They don't know. They are amateurs.

107
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:10,059
No, Salamander, they are not amateurs.

108
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:13,159
They are very clever men dedicated to their work.

109
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:16,559
But they are men, capable of human error like anybody else.

110
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,591
Do what you wish.
Captain!

111
00:20:20,398 --> 00:20:21,079
Sir!

112
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,759
Controller Denes is leaving.

113
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:23,752
Yes, sir.

114
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:26,039
You will soon see that I am right.

115
00:20:26,134 --> 00:20:29,189
Oh, you will stay, ah? Have a drink.

116
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:31,939
We have a great deal to talk about, you and I.

117
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,039
Fariah, see to him.

118
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:38,768
That might be her now. Yes.

119
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:41,818
Hello, Giles? This is me, Astrid.

120
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:43,223
Right letâ€˜s have it. What's happening?

121
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:45,571
Everything's gone fine so far.

122
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,661
And the rocket arrived right on time in Hungary.

123
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,261
And Jamie's got his entrance pass
and has started phase one.

124
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:53,525
- Do you think the boy can handle it?
- Well I hope so.

125
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:56,829
My goodness they're a pretty
odd lot though, aren't they?

126
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:58,750
Well actually the Doctor's with me right now.

127
00:20:58,981 --> 00:21:02,613
Oh, I am sorry. Oh I know...
I'm sure they'll be fine.

128
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:06,667
What news of Denes? We must keep him posted
as to what is happening.

129
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,559
It's all right, we've contacted
and we've arranged to meet.

130
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,448
Be careful, he's pretty well known.

131
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,809
But what on earth made you
take a job as a food taster?

132
00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:15,948
She was hungry.

133
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:19,498
Only thing is, now she has all the food she needs,

134
00:21:19,593 --> 00:21:21,948
...she has lost her appetite.
Give me a drink!

135
00:21:22,288 --> 00:21:23,588
You are well protected.

136
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:24,634
Um.

137
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:33,535
Very well protected.
Be calm. Sit down, drink your drink.

138
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:34,400
Ah!

139
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:41,960
Thank you for calling the guard.
I was wondering what to do about him.

140
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:44,661
Now don't move for that box!
Not if you value your life.

141
00:21:44,732 --> 00:21:48,961
Now all of you, back over there! That's it.

142
00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:53,061
Not as well protected as you think you are, eh?

143
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:59,061
Now when I say duck... Duck, get down!

144
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:17,143
Look at this! What do you do boys, eh?

145
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:21,043
Read? Sleep? It's a fine thing.

146
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,843
Here we have an attempt to destroy me
and where are you?

147
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:27,843
It's not so good, boys.
It's not so good. I'm watching you.

148
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:33,443
Look after him. Better still, get rid of him.

149
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:40,343
- What's all this about. Eh?
- I heard two men talking.

150
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:43,592
They said they'd planted a bomb of some kind
in your radio telephone.

151
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:45,792
I tried to warn them at the gates,
but they wouldn't pay any attention.

152
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:48,404
So you break in? How you break in?

153
00:22:48,518 --> 00:22:50,371
Well I'm here on holiday with a friend.

154
00:22:50,418 --> 00:22:53,471
She's very pretty, so the guard
didn't see me slip past him.

155
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:57,836
Why didn't you call out and warn me?
I nearly used the radio telephone several times.

156
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,432
Ah you'd have had me shot, most like.

157
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:03,107
Why do you risk your skin to save me?

158
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:06,197
Well without you
the Earth hasn't much of a chance, has it?

159
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:15,149
You like to work for me, eh? You like that?

160
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:17,298
Oh no, you don't have to do that.
I mean, you owe me nothing.

161
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:18,616
You're quite right, boy.

162
00:23:18,756 --> 00:23:20,058
And I'm on holiday.

163
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:22,061
You won't find what I pay you disappointing.

164
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:24,984
Aye, there's my girlfriend too though.

165
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,417
Oh we might be able to find something for her.
Eh Fariah?

166
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,302
Yes, your chef could use an assistant.

167
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:31,760
See to it. What do you say, eh?

168
00:23:31,902 --> 00:23:33,376
Well I'll give it a go.

169
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:35,476
But I'll say this though,
your security system's rotten.

170
00:23:35,502 --> 00:23:37,076
There'll have to be changes.

171
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:39,079
Oh what a boy, ah?

172
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:42,979
Fariah, see he gets some proper uniform
instead of this skirt.

173
00:23:43,335 --> 00:23:45,697
And bring him and his girlfriend to see me.

174
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:47,126
Come along then.

175
00:23:49,535 --> 00:23:52,816
What an extraordinary young man.

176
00:23:53,027 --> 00:23:55,546
I prize loyalty very highly, my friend.

177
00:23:55,627 --> 00:24:00,846
And I repay it very generously.
Like I do the girl Fariah, eh.

178
00:24:17,012 --> 00:24:20,455
I used to love to do this sort of thing when I was a boy.

179
00:24:20,764 --> 00:24:23,063
I'm sorry. It was the safest place I could think of.

180
00:24:23,202 --> 00:24:24,778
Oh, it's all right. I'm still fit enough.

181
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,234
Thank you for getting me the necessary documents.

182
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:29,463
Have you been successful?

183
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:31,745
So far. Salamander's swallowed it.

184
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:32,980
I thought he would.

185
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:35,800
The boy's very confident.
The girl, not so much.

186
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:40,005
See, the point is that I'm near enough
to him to pick out something.

187
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:42,805
This was the first time I met Salamander.

188
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,805
I must say that you were right about him, Astrid.

189
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,080
We must get rid of him. He must be stopped.

190
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:51,355
He will be stopped!
I'm returning to Giles Kent.

191
00:24:51,481 --> 00:24:53,845
Can you wait till we can take action?

192
00:24:54,497 --> 00:24:56,791
Oh, with a bit of luck, yes.

193
00:24:58,051 --> 00:25:01,870
Fedorin, would he betray you in some way?

194
00:25:02,689 --> 00:25:05,395
I'm trying to think of some reason why he should.

195
00:25:05,697 --> 00:25:08,826
But these are all lies, Salamander. Lies, I assure you.

196
00:25:08,982 --> 00:25:09,991
So you say.

197
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:12,895
What are you going to do? My family... my friends.

198
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:19,007
My dear man. My dear Fedorin.

199
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:25,307
You don't suppose I intend to
make your swindling public, eh?

200
00:25:25,496 --> 00:25:32,007
This is... this just an insurance, um.
Sit down, forget it.

201
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:37,007
I tell you what I'm going to do for you.

202
00:25:37,387 --> 00:25:38,139
What?

203
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:42,254
You are going to replace Denes
as controller of this Zone.

204
00:25:42,496 --> 00:25:45,754
But, don't say anything.
I'll know you'll accept.

205
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:47,518
What do you want?

206
00:25:48,308 --> 00:25:52,568
I'll tell you. There will be disaster in this Zone.

207
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:54,532
I cannot stop the disaster,

208
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:59,568
but I can come to the aid of this Zone
when it's happened.

209
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:01,952
And take over? I see.

210
00:26:02,052 --> 00:26:04,990
- The Zone would be yours!
- Oh ours, Fedorin, ours.

211
00:26:05,008 --> 00:26:07,816
It's a partnership I'm offering you.

212
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:12,816
Either you have half of everything, or you have nothing.

213
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,457
But there's Alexander Denes.

214
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:18,922
Oh yes, the popular, well beloved Denes.

215
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:21,873
- What a pity.  - Pity?

216
00:26:21,977 --> 00:26:25,140
Oh didn't I tell you, Denes is going to die.

217
00:26:25,307 --> 00:26:30,140
Mysteriously... an assassin... terrible.

218
00:26:31,445 --> 00:26:34,251
I can't do that! You can't ask me!

219
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:37,537
I think I can ask you to do anything I want.

220
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:42,935
My predictions are accurate!

221
00:26:48,493 --> 00:26:52,935
The entire Eperjes-Tokaj Ranges are in eruption!

222
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:07,935
Fedorin, come and look. It's very pretty.

223
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:12,935
The history of Hungary is about to be rewritten!

224
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:16,592
Salamander.

225
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,288
What are you doing here, Bruce?

226
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:20,594
I had a report there was trouble here,
an attempt on your life.

227
00:27:20,695 --> 00:27:22,175
It was nothing. Come and look.

228
00:27:37,277 --> 00:27:40,978
Terrible. Those poor people.

229
00:27:41,397 --> 00:27:44,026
Salamander! What have you done?

230
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:45,653
I warned you!

231
00:27:45,785 --> 00:27:49,743
You couldn't have known!
You've done this somehow yourself!

232
00:27:50,327 --> 00:27:53,808
The man is mad! Worse still he is incompetent!

233
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:57,258
I warned this man that this zone
was in danger of natural disaster...

234
00:27:57,351 --> 00:28:00,551
...and he did nothing!
Issued no cautions to the public.

235
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:03,509
You deliberately allowed your people to suffer and die!

236
00:28:03,578 --> 00:28:04,509
You're a traitor!

237
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:07,960
You're a traitor! You contrived this for your own ends.

238
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:10,921
Bruce, I order you to arrest this man.

239
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:16,439
But this is nonsense. Fedorin, you were here.

240
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:18,389
You know this is nonsense.

241
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:20,513
Denes you are too naive.

242
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,713
At your trial, Fedorin will be
the chief witness against you!
