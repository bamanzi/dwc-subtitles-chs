1
00:49:27,813 --> 00:49:31,455
Over there... No, not you.
过去那边...不, 你不去

2
00:49:33,913 --> 00:49:36,855
Sit down, all of you.
坐下, 你们全部

3
00:49:37,154 --> 00:49:39,873
Incredible. You fooled me the first time we met,
不可思议．我们第一次碰面时你骗过了我...

4
00:49:39,994 --> 00:49:44,223
but now, even Salamander himself 
would think he was looking in a mirror.
看看现在, 就算 Salamander 他自己也会以为他在照镜子

5
00:49:44,254 --> 00:49:49,123
Why? You want this man to impersonate Salamander, why?
为什么？你想让这个人假冒 Salamander, 为什么？

6
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:52,423
How much are they paying you?
他们付给你多少钱？

7
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:53,503
I beg your pardon?
你说什么？

8
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:56,220
They want you to assassinate Salamander, 
don't they? Take his place?
他们想让你刺杀 Salamander, 对吧？取而代之？

9
00:49:57,072 --> 00:49:58,820
That's ridiculous! I couldn't possibly do that.
简直荒唐！我不可能干出这种事情

10
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,179
But you were preparing to impersonate him, weren't you?
但你早就在准备假冒他, 是吧？

11
00:50:01,392 --> 00:50:02,178
Well well, yes.
噢好吧, 是的

12
00:50:02,326 --> 00:50:03,946
Alright then, why?
那好了, 为什么？

13
00:50:04,122 --> 00:50:08,704
Because Salamander holds my two friends prisoner
and I was going to attempt to rescue them.
因为 Salamander 关押了我的两个朋友, 我是打算营救他们

14
00:50:08,966 --> 00:50:13,861
And at the same time get evidence
that would expose Salamander...
与此同时，找到证据, 可以用来揭发 Salamander...

15
00:50:13,966 --> 00:50:17,461
...as a traitor, blackmailer and murderer!
...证明他是个卖国贼, 勒索犯, 凶手！

16
00:50:17,657 --> 00:50:20,306
Quite an ambitious plan.
How do you know such evidence exists?
计划很有野心嘛．你怎么知道这种证据存在呢？

17
00:50:20,478 --> 00:50:21,719
It exists in Salamander's records.
它存在于 Salamander 的档案室

18
00:50:21,908 --> 00:50:24,365
Oh, yes, I know why you want Salamander out of the way.
哦, 是的, 我知道你为什么要除掉 Salamander

19
00:50:24,478 --> 00:50:30,365
You hate him because he exposed 
your profitable sideline of misusing public money.
你恨他, 因为他揭露了你那盈利颇丰的副业是挪用公款办的

20
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,958
Oh, it was Salamander who was misusing the money.
噢, Salamander 才是挪用公款的人

21
00:50:33,107 --> 00:50:36,334
And I was dismissed from my post and
the evidence against Salamander concealed.
然后我就被从位子上赶下来, 对 Salamander 不利的证据就不见了

22
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,129
So you say. But you've no evidence at all
against Salamander, have you?
这是你的说法．但你没有针对 Salamander 的任何证据, 有吗？

23
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,485
I tell you the evidence is in Salamander's records.
我告诉你证据就在 Salamander 的档案室

24
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:44,462
And I'm expected to take that from you?
而你就指望我信了你的邪?

25
00:50:44,578 --> 00:50:46,935
We do hold evidence...
我们的确有证据...

26
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:50,306
that Salamander isn't quite
so pure and white as he's painted.
证明 Salamander 并不像他自己所粉刷的那么清白

27
00:50:50,498 --> 00:50:51,839
No? What?
不清白？什么证据？

28
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:55,599
A file, containing certain information
about a gentleman called Fedorin.
一份文件, 里面有关于一位叫 Fedorin 的先生的一些信息

29
00:50:56,164 --> 00:51:00,085
Salamander was going to
use this evidence against Fedorin. 
Salamander 本打算用这个证据来对付 Fedorin

30
00:51:00,164 --> 00:51:04,585
Blackmail him into submission.
after he'd got rid of Denes, that is.
勒索他逼他就范 — 就在他除掉 Denes 之后

31
00:51:04,826 --> 00:51:06,768
And so gain control of another zone.
这样就可以得到又一个区的控制权

32
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,148
Where is this file?
这份文件在哪里？

33
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:10,851
Fariah has it, Salamander's food taster.
Fariah 手上, Salamander 的食物品尝员

34
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:14,340
Fariah? But she's dead.
Fariah? 但她已经死了

35
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:17,715
Dead? But how?
死了？怎么死的？

36
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:20,111
She was shot by one of Benik's guards, escaping arrest.
她被 Benik 的一个警卫击中了, 在逃避追捕的时候

37
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:24,513
Escaping arrest? Benik had her killed,
逃避追捕？是 Benik 让人杀了她

38
00:51:24,616 --> 00:51:26,613
because she had evidence against Salamander.

39

And Benik will return the file to Salamander.

40
00:51:29,493 --> 00:51:31,198
We must get to the Research Station.

41
00:51:31,285 --> 00:51:32,534
You're not going anywhere or doing anything.
你哪儿也不能去, 什么也不能做

42
00:51:32,685 --> 00:51:35,634
As far as I'm concerned, this story you've told me
could be a pack of lies...
就我看来, 你告诉我的这个故事可能只是一堆谎言...

43
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:38,334
to cover your attempt to assassinate Salamander.
只为了给你企图刺杀 Salamander 找借口

44
00:51:38,485 --> 00:51:43,334
Now I'm not saying I'm altogether satisfied with
Salamander or his organisation,
我现在倒不是说我全然赞同 Salamander 和他的安排

45
00:51:43,455 --> 00:51:45,634
but I'll investigate in my own way.
但我会用自己的方式进行调查

46
00:51:45,889 --> 00:51:49,059
Meanwhile Salamander will have found a way to cover himself,
与此同时 Salamander 会找到方法为他自己打掩护

47
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,699
and also a way of disposing of you.
You're digging your own grave, Bruce.
还能找到方法干掉你．你是在自掘坟墓, Bruce

48
00:51:52,907 --> 00:51:55,964
That's my affair. And I do things my own way.

49
00:51:56,982 --> 00:51:59,594
And I do things my way.

50
00:52:00,054 --> 00:52:04,197
Really, as Head of Security,
you should have more reliable guards.
真的, 作为安全主管, 你应该有一些更可靠的护卫

51
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:09,350
- Leader Salamander?
- Still inside, sir.

So you've brought them?
Good. Any trouble?

No, a light drug saw to that.

Yes sir.

I'm looking forward to questioning them.
I have the feeling they're going to be stubborn.
我很期待能审讯他们．我有一种感觉他们会很顽固

59
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,870
So much more interesting when our prisoners are stubborn.
我们的囚犯很顽固的时候, 乐趣就多了

60
00:52:41,706 --> 00:52:45,748
You're only making trouble for yourself.
Killing me won't get you anywhere.
你这只是在给自己找麻烦．杀了我不会给你带来任何好处

61
00:52:45,837 --> 00:52:49,951
We have to get to the Research Station,
and you're not going to stop us.

You don't really believe I came here
with just one guard, do you?
你不会真的相信我只带了一个警卫就过来了吧, 是吗？

64
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,393
You'd be very silly to try and fight your way out.
你要是想试着硬闯出去就太傻了

65
00:52:58,505 --> 00:53:02,253
I'd give you about... thirty seconds to live if you try.
我会让你们活大约...30秒，你们不妨一试

66
00:53:02,356 --> 00:53:04,338
Alright Bruce, we might have just thirty seconds

但你只有那一半时间, 还得运气好！

- What?  - Me.

And what about your two friends?

to the tender mercies of Salamander?

00:53:25,412 --> 00:53:28,292
- What?  - Please? Just trust me.

00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:39,941
Hold it.

It's alright, Mister Bruce isn't going
to shoot anyone, are you?

81
00:53:43,283 --> 00:53:46,068
Why? Why'd you do that?

Go on.

Now I want you to trust me.

You must be a complete fool, or very clever.
你肯定是个完全的傻子, 或者是极其聪明

00:53:59,685 --> 00:54:03,136
Well I'm afraid you will have to 
make up your mind to that right away.

And if there isn't any evidence?

and put us in prison, won't you?
那你就完全可以逮捕我们, 把我们扔进监狱, 行吗？
