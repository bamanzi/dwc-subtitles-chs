Over there... No, not you. Sit down, all of you.
过去那边...不, 不是你．坐下, 你们全部

2
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:38,923
Incredible. You fooled me the first time we met,
不可思议．我们第一次碰面时你骗过了我...

00:49:39,054 --> 00:49:43,423
but now, even Salamander himself would think
he was looking in a mirror. /43.5
看看现在, 就算 Salamander 他自己也会以为他在照镜子

00:49:43,454 --> 00:49:48,323
Why? You want this man to impersonate Salamander, why?

How much are they paying you?

3
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:53,103
I beg your pardon?

00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:55,820
They want you to assassinate Salamander, don't they?
Take his place?
他们想让你刺杀 Salamander, 对吧？取而代之？

5
00:49:56,672 --> 00:49:58,420
That's ridiculous! I couldn't possibly do that.
简直荒唐！我不可能干出这种事情

But you were preparing to impersonate him, weren't you?

00:50:01,926 --> 00:50:03,546
Alright then, why?

00:50:03,722 --> 00:50:08,304
Because Salamander holds my two friends prisoner
and I was going to attempt to rescue them.
因为 Salamander 扣押了我的两个朋友, 我是打算营救他们

Quite an ambitious plan. How do you know such evidence exists?

It exists in Salamander's records.

哦, 是的, 我知道你为什么要除掉 Salamander

Oh, it was Salamander who was misusing the money.
噢, Salamander 才是挪用公款的人

15

And I was dismissed from my post and
the evidence against Salamander concealed.
然后我就被从位子上赶下来了, 对 Salamander 不利的证据就不见了

against Salamander, have you?
这是你的一面之辞．但你没有针对 Salamander 的任何证据, 有吗？

I tell you the evidence is in Salamander's records.
我告诉你证据就在 Salamander 的文件里

18
00:50:42,286 --> 00:50:43,762
And I'm expected to take that from you?

We do hold evidence that Salamander isn't quite
so pure and white as he's painted.

Salamander 本打算用这个证据来对付 Fedorin, 勒索他逼他就范

After he'd got rid of Denes, that is.

23
00:51:04,426 --> 00:51:06,368
And so gain control of another zone.

You're not going anywhere or doing anything.

31
00:51:31,685 --> 00:51:35,234
As far as I'm concerned, this story you've told me
could be a pack of lies...
在我看来, 你告诉我的这个故事可能只是一堆谎言...

只为了给你企图刺杀 Salamander 找借口

Salamander or his organisation,

but I'll investigate in my own way.

You're digging your own grave, Bruce.
还能找到方法干掉你．你是在自掘坟墓, Bruce
