because he realized I was beginning to get suspicious.

Out of revenge.

Yes, I suppose so. Then you can judge for yourself.

(s/Shockingly/Hockingham,/) murdered!
他在离海岸一英里的地方淹死了. 可怕的谋杀啊!

or a man known as his deputy

known to be in Salamander's power.

00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:54,796
- Known by who?   - By me, Doctor.
- 据谁了解?   - 我, 博士

81
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,357
Well why don't you tell the authorities,
the police or whatever?
那, 你怎么不告诉当局, 警察什么的?

82
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,582
Because I'm discredited, don't you see?
因为我名誉扫地了, 你没明白吗?

83
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,082
Because Salamander is so popular,
由于 Salamander 是如此受欢迎

84
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:04,582
and also because the man that took my place,
a man named Donald Bruce...
也因为那个顶了我位置的人, Donald Bruce...

85
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:06,582
...has since risen to become overall security chief.

Surely there is someone you can take your story to?
肯定你还有些人可以把故事讲给他们听?

87

Ah yes, Helvig believed me.
So did Assevski, and they're dead.
啊是有, Helvig 信我, Assevski 也是, 而他们都死了

a man named Alexander Denes,

89
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:20,056
but none of them will do anything until it's too late!

90
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:22,007
I'm surprised.
我觉得奇怪

91
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:27,007
Well if Salamander is everything you say he is,
then why hasn't he tried to...
如果 Salamander 完全是你说的这种人, 那他怎么没有试图...

92
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:28,736
- Dispose of me?  - Yes
- 干掉我?   - 对

93
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:30,662
Well he has, but he's afraid.
他试过, 但他害怕

94
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:33,662
You see, the testimony of a dead man
still holds legal weight.
你知道, 一个死人的证词还是有法律效应的

95
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:38,508
Oh, I see. Well, it seems we have a problem on our hands...
哦, 我明白了. 那, 看来我们手头有一个问题是...

00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,608
...whether to believe Mr Kent or not.
...要信任 Kent 先生还是不要

97
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,413
Well there is one way that you can find out for yourselves.
那好. 这里有一个方法, 你们可以自己弄清楚真相

98
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,223
Oh, how?
噢, 什么方法?

99
00:10:42,338 --> 00:10:43,624
Impersonate Salamander.
假冒 Salamander

100
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:45,874
Yes I thought that's what we were leading up to.
是啊, 我估计我们就要被往这条路上引

101
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,885
Well I must admit, Doctor, you do look like him.
是, 我必须承认, 博士, 你真的很像他

102

Exactly like him.

103
00:10:48,942 --> 00:10:50,641
Yes, there's more to it than that. What about the voice?
是, 但还有别的方面, 比如说嗓音怎么办?

104
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,682
Well it's nearly the same pitch, only the accent.
调门差不多, 只是口音问题

105
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:55,190
Only the accent! My dear young lady.
只是口音问题! 我亲爱的年轻女士

106
00:10:55,222 --> 00:11:01,790
Oh dear. Now what was it he said...
噢, 天啊. 他说了什么来着

107
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:08,490
We still cannot guarantee good summer holidays for all.
"但我们无法保障所有地方都有漂亮的夏日"

108
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:13,270
No. Guarantee... no, no, no... guaran... guarantee.
You see, it's very difficult.
不对. "保障..." 不不不, "保...保障". 你看, 这非常困难

109
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:18,070
Hmm, of course I always was interested in phonetics
嗯, 当然了我一直对发音有兴趣

110
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:20,670
Holidays... summer... summer.
＂假日...夏天..夏天＂

111
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:25,410
He must have come from Mexico,
Quintana Roo or Yucatan or somewhere...
他肯定是来自墨西哥, Quintana Roo 州或者 Yucatan 州什么的

112
00:11:25,504 --> 00:11:28,909
That's incredible, Doctor, he was born at Merida,
state capital of Yucatan.
神啊, 博士. 他出生在 Merida, 是 Yucantan 州的省会

113
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:32,658
Yes, there are other very strong influences though.
是了, 但还受到了一些其它地方的强印象

114
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:36,458
Oh, I could do it in time.
But what if I did it, what then?
噢, 我可以及时搞定. 但如果我搞定了, 然后怎样?

115
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:39,665
You could walk into Salamander's research station at Kanowa,
你可以进入 Salamander 在 Kanowa 的研究站

116
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:43,765
find out how he's getting control of the separate
World Zones, and then bring out absolute proof.
发现他是如何操纵世界各区的, 把切实的证据带出来

117
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:51,129
Yes. I see.
好, 我明白了

118
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:56,165
How long did you say it would take you
to master Salamander's accent?
你说你掌握 Salamander 的口音需要多久?

119
00:11:56,421 --> 00:12:00,009
I didn't. It would take three weeks, perhaps four.
我没说过. 需要三个星期, 或者四个

120
00:12:00,206 --> 00:12:03,339
Well while we've been talking,
the Security Chief I told you about,
但是我们说话的这会儿, 我跟你说过的安全总管...

121
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:06,639
Donald Bruce, has since cordoned off this entire area.

He's coming here himself...Now!

123
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:12,939
I'd say you've got about two minutes, Doctor.
我得说你只有大约两分钟, 博士

124
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:13,894
But that's out of the question!
但这根本不可能啊!

125
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,828
You know what he'll do as soon as he sees you,/?

126
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,528
a man who resembles Salamander so closely?

- Will you please listen!
- 噢, 真不公平!   - 你肯听我说一句吗!

128
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:23,585
You'll be under arrest for impersonation
as soon as he sees you. I mean it.
他一看见你, 你就会因冒充而被逮捕的. 我说真的

129
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:25,134
But isn't there another way out of this?
但就没有别的办法了吗?

130
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:26,937
Only one - be Salamander.

But the clothes!

有, 这里有一些. 表现自然一点, 但要尽力而为

I won't! I can't!

Don't push me, there isn't time.

now please come on.
我不可能错失这样的机会. 现在请快点吧

It's far too risky.

141
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:01,820
Hello Kent. Doing some recruiting are you?

A bit young for killers, aren't they?

All right, what do you want?
好吧, 你想要什么?

you know the way it's got to go.
这好多了. 你是前任安全官, 你知道接下来会怎样

We might as well be nice and civil about it, mightn't we?

That bungalow in Cedar District. In your name, right?

There's been an awful nasty mess out there.

Now listen to this, all of you.

You were in that bungalow at the time.

163
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:07,136
And there were three other people with you,
two youngsters and a man. Right?
当时有三个人跟你在一起. 两个小年青和一个中年人, 对吧

Now, there was another man, wasn't there?

So we'll deal with that first? Where is he?

166
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:34,854
Why hello Bruce, what are you doing here, huh?
哟, 你好 Bruch, 你在这里做什么, 哈?

167
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:40,077
I was under the impression
you were in the Central European Zone, Leader.

I do not care to be questioned by my own security!
我不喜欢被我自己的安保人员质问!

171
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:52,903
Well that's just it. How can I possibly
maintain security when you behave like this?
好我正要说这个. 你行为这样, 我怎么能保障安全呢?

172
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,003
I'm at least entitled to know your movements.

173
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:58,209
You have a policeman's mind, Bruce.
你有一个警察的思维, Bruce

174
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:02,516
That may be! Only a few days ago you questioned me
about this man and his activities.
可能吧! 仅仅几天以前, 你还在问我这个人和他的活动情况

175
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:06,116
And we agreed that he was dangerous!
Now, I find you in his office.
而且我们都同意他很危险!  而现在, 我发现你在他的办公室

176
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:12,654
Sometimes I like to deal with matters in my own way.

- They're not holding you here?  - Holding me?

I still think I deserve an explanation, Leader.

Yes, of course, you shall have it.

182
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:31,526
But not now. When I return from the Central European Zone.

183

Now what about the dead man found in your bungalow.

He was one of your lot, wasn't he?
他是你们当中的一个, 对吧?

186
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:45,923
Yes. Um, he was trying to protect me.
The other two wanted to kill me.
是的. 唔, 他当时在尽力保护我, 另外那两个人想杀我

187
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:49,404
Now why should they want to do that
to a nice young girl like you?
那为什么他们会对你这样一个年轻女孩儿做那种事情?

188
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:50,629
Well I...
这个我...

189
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,881
Obviously they thought I was there.

You?

Yes, Bruce, just like you,
a lot of people don't like me.
是的, Bruce, 跟你一样, 很多人不喜欢我

192
00:15:57,911 --> 00:16:01,551
Don't get clever with me, Kent!
I've a good mind to...
别跟我耍聪明, Kent! 我倒相信是....

I am prepared to accept his story.

That's interesting, but not important.
这很有意思, 但并不重要

196
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:09,022
I accept it! That's all that matters.
我接受! 这才是重要的

197
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:12,577
It's beginning to look as if these people
are working for you now. Is that right?
看起来, 这些人现在为你工作了? 是这样吗?

198
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:19,003
You still dare to question me!
They have information! I shall get it!
你还是敢质问我? 他们有情报, 我要得到!

199
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,803
I will see you on my return. Now leave me!

- McCrimmon, you said?  - Aye

201
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,267
Well you just watch your step, that's all.
好, 你看好你的步子, 小心点

202
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:39,025
I never said a word.
我什么也没说啊

203
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:44,239
Must be the way you look, Jamie.
那肯定是你的样子看起来有问题, Jamie

204
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:45,832

That was a dangerous game to play.

It paid off. All right, are you with us?

208
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,373
I don't know where you stand, Mr Kent.
我并不知道你的立场, Kent 先生

209
00:16:55,429 --> 00:17:01,473
But you and this Salamander are obviously
on opposite sides. That at least is clear.
但你和这个 Salamander 显然是对立的, 这点至少是清楚的

210
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:06,773
But which side is good? Which side is bad?
And why should I interfere?
但那一方是好的, 那一方是坏的? 为什么我要插手?

Well you're the only man who can help save the world.

But isn't that what Salamander's trying to do?

Don't you understand? Salamander...
你不明白吗?  Salamander...

214
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:17,271
Just a moment. Jamie, you're unusually quiet,
what do you think?
等一下. Jamie, 你一反常态的安静, 你怎么想的?

aye, well it sounds grand, but...
哦, 拯救世界, 是, 这听起来很伟大, 但是...

on a challenge like this, Doctor.

Well, at least I know you wouldn't.

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:26,520
We don't know anything about these people.

Astrid saved our lives.
She was wounded because of it.

- 噢, 但是Jamie, 你不是觉得...  - 嘿, 她是...

Look, we're right about Salamander!

It won't take you long to find out for yourselves.

How do you propose we do that?

He'll be well guarded for a start.

We can hardly steal into his study
and go through his papers.
我们很难猫进他的书房, 去查阅他的文件

he was in the Central European Zone.

inner circle for some time.

I thought you said you had no official position?

We have a contact there.
我们在里面有联络人

240
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:14,338
He must be a very important person.

Oh, I see. What about me?

I think we better have a look at
Salamander's research station at Kanowa.
我想我们最好看一下 Salamander 在 Kanowa 的研究站

是的. 啊, 是, 但当然是在一个安全距离来看

This is dreadful news, Salamander.
I still can't believe it.

Terrible, terrible.

I say it can happen.

Here, here and here.
你的区域有危险了, Denes. 这里, 这里和这里

We've had no trouble for years in those mountains.

You don't imagine I make it up?

No, no, of course not.

Those volcanoes have been dead
since sixteenth century. Fedorin is right to doubt.
这些火山自从16世纪就沉寂了. Fedorin 的疑问是有理由的

I tell you the truth.
火山是一个奇怪的东西, 我的朋友. 我来跟你说说真实情况

sleeping... still... lifeless.
就像一个在烈日下面的男人, 沉睡...沉寂...毫无生机

I know volcanoes.
然后嘣! 他满能量爆发了! 我懂火山的

miscalculation for a few degrees?
有没有可能在计算上有少许几度的偏差?

it's... it's not real evidence.
但我担心这个...这个仍然不是证据, 它...不是真正的证据

611
00:39:12,445 --> 00:39:15,337

and someone's beaten you to it.
我只会死一次, 有人已经比你抢先一步了(?)

662
00:41:41,393 --> 00:41:43,609
Who was the other man?
另外那个人是谁?

663
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:47,947
Sir?
长官?

664
00:41:49,152 --> 00:41:50,583
She's dead.
她死了

665
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:52,778
Good.
好

666
00:41:59,013 --> 00:42:03,369
Fedorin's file. Thank you.
Fedorin 的档案, 谢谢你

667
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:10,557
What you mean is you failed.
你的意思是你失败了

668
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,455
I always said something should be done about Kent.
我一直都说应该对 Kent 动手

669
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:16,299
You always say. You say things, but you don't think.
你一直在说. 你是在说, 但你不思考

670
00:42:16,463 --> 00:42:19,413
You exceeded your authority, Benik.
A woman's been killed.
你超出对你的授权了, Benik. 一个女人被杀了

671
00:42:19,563 --> 00:42:20,185
Resisting arrest.
她拘捕

672
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:23,411
Maybe. But you can't just take the law into your own hands.
也许吧. 但你没法把法律掌握在自己手上

673
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:25,411
Giles Kent hadn't broken any rules that I know of.
Giles Kent 没有触犯任何我所知道的规则

674
00:42:25,602 --> 00:42:29,131
For sure he'd show himself one day,
he was simply building up his resistance group.
他肯定会在某天露面的, 他只是在组建他的抵抗小组

675
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:35,114
Resistance group! The man's a traitor.
These people are rebels.
抵抗小组! 这人是个卖国贼, 这些人都是叛军

676
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:41,611
Bruce, you must find this man who impersonated me.
The dangers are obvious.
Bruce, 你必须找到这个冒充我的人. 危险性是显然的

677
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:45,254
He could walk in anywhere at any time
pretending to be me and ruin everything.
他可能在任何时间任何地点假冒我, 把一切都毁了

678
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:46,113
You can leave that to me.
这你就交给我吧

679
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:47,071
How so?
怎么会这样?

680
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:51,272
Benik, come with me and I'll go over
the security arrangements with you now.
Benik, 跟我来, 我现在跟你过一遍安保措施

681
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:55,213
Do as you're told!
遵守命令!

682
00:42:57,084 --> 00:42:59,521
I think you'll find this interesting.
我想你会发现这个很有意思

683
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:06,693
What? The girl Fariah had this?
什么? Fariah 那个女孩儿拿到了这个?

684
00:43:10,034 --> 00:43:11,693
What can I say?
我能说什么?

685
00:43:23,024 --> 00:43:23,981
Yes sir?
什么事, 长官?

686
00:43:24,317 --> 00:43:28,490
The records room is out of bounds.
I am not to be disturbed.
档案室现在禁止入内了. 我不想被打扰

687
00:43:28,617 --> 00:43:30,390
See that the security locks are engaged.
确保安全锁已经锁上了

688
00:43:30,513 --> 00:43:32,502
Very well, sir. For how long, sir?
好的, 长官. 锁多久, 长官?

689
00:43:32,606 --> 00:43:33,972
For as long as I say so.
我说多久就多久

690
00:43:34,082 --> 00:43:34,796
Yes sir.
好的, 长官

691
00:45:24,029 --> 00:45:27,385
It seems that Salamander's
locked himself away and can't be got at.
看起来 Salamander 把他自己锁起来了, 无法联系

692
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:28,262
So?
那?

693
00:45:28,406 --> 00:45:30,200
Well, suppose the place caught fire?
哦, 万一这个地方着火了呢?

694
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:31,220
It won't.
不会的

695
00:45:31,366 --> 00:45:32,193
Don't be foolish!
别犯傻!

696
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:35,498
Look, I can only tell you that
when Salamander works in records,
看, 我只能告诉你, 当 Salamander 在档案室里工作时

697
00:45:35,591 --> 00:45:38,598
as he does from time to time, no one is allowed in.
他经常这样的时候, 不允许任何人进去

698
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:43,092
I can understand if it were a... laboratory...
要是这是一间...实验室, 我还能理解

699
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:45,292
or... a... research room of some sort, but a...
或者...一间研究室什么的 , 但是....

700
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:49,592
a records room? What sort of records
have you got in there anyway?
一间档案室? 你们那里面有什么样的档案?

701
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:50,499
What did you want to see him about?
你想见他做什么?

702
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:53,017
Never mind. I just don't like mysteries.
没什么, 我只是不喜欢这么神秘

703
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:56,217
Salamander's far too important
to lock himself away like this,
Salamander 太重要了, 不能这样把自己锁起来

704
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:59,317
anything might happen, a world emergency.
一旦发生点什么, 都是世界级事件

705
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:04,017
Suppose I had to order you to let me in there?
如果我不得不命令你让我进去呢?

706
00:46:04,213 --> 00:46:09,260
It wouldn't do any good. When the locks are switched over
they can only be opened from the inside.
那也没什么用, 一旦锁上了, 就只能从里面打开

707
00:46:57,872 --> 00:47:03,963
I have returned.
Take radiation precautions.
我回来了. 你们采取预防辐射措施

708
00:47:04,172 --> 00:47:07,963
I will make a report about the surface.
我要做一份关于地表的报告

709
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,670
He's back!
他回来了!

710
00:47:09,867 --> 00:47:11,498
He's managed to get back again.
他终于又设法回来了

711
00:47:11,616 --> 00:47:13,280
Let's hope he's got some good news this time.
期望这次他能带来些好消息

712
00:47:13,379 --> 00:47:15,240
Do you think Salamander's found some more food, Swann?
你觉得 Salamander 找到了更多食物了没, Swann?

713
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:19,057
I hope so, otherwise we're finished.
Where's that stock list?
我期望是, 否则我们就完了. 那张储物清单呢?

714
00:47:23,659 --> 00:47:26,504
Welcome back, Salamander. Are you all right?
欢迎回来, Salamander . 你没事吧?

715
00:47:26,582 --> 00:47:31,827
Don't, don't come too near my friend,
I am not yet decontaminated.
别, 别靠太近, 我的朋友. 我还没消毒

716
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,827
I am too weary, totally weary.
我很疲惫, 完全累坏了

717
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:37,834
You shouldn't have made this trip,
Salamander, you're doing too much.
你不应该来这一趟的, Salamander. 你做得太多了

718
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:41,465
Someone has to bring back the food
for you, my friend, huh?
必须得有个人给你们带食物回来, 我的朋友, 是吧?

719
00:47:43,115 --> 00:47:47,865
You know that the radiation
is slowly killing me, don't you Swann?
你知道辐射正在慢慢地杀死我, 是不, Swann?

720
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,417
You're just doing too much.
你付出得太多了

721
00:47:49,557 --> 00:47:51,628
I worry about you all the time.
我一直都担心你们

722
00:47:53,057 --> 00:47:56,228
What're you going to do when I am no longer here?
如果我不在这里了, 你们该怎么办?

723
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:04,087
Radiation gets a little more each time, hm?
辐射一次比一次强了, 嗯?

724
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,887
One day, that needle will stay at maximum radiation.
某一天, 那根针会一直指向最大辐射强度

725
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:13,846
- Don't say that.  - Why... Mary. Colin.
- 别那么说  - 为什么... Mary, Colin.

726
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,084
Huh, it's my big joke, huh?
哈, 我开的玩笑有点大, 哈?

727
00:48:15,317 --> 00:48:17,004
Just to frighten you a little.
只是为了小小吓唬你们一下

728
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:18,904
I've got good news for us!
我有好消息带给大家!

729
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:19,927
We can return to the surface?
我们可以回到地面上去了?

730
00:48:20,036 --> 00:48:23,694
No no no not yet, but I've found another store of food...
不不不, 还不行, 但我找到了另外一个食物储藏点...

731
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:24,897
Thank goodness!
感谢老天!

732
00:48:25,023 --> 00:48:28,643
...And it is undamaged.
Colin, open the last store of wine, huh?
...而且保存完好. Colin, 打开最后那批酒吧, 哈?

733
00:48:28,723 --> 00:48:32,643
Go on, you help him too, Mary.
去吧, 你也帮帮他, Mary

734
00:48:34,707 --> 00:48:36,685
You must take it slowly for goodness sake.
你必须慢点, 老天

735
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:41,662
I'm all right my friend. I'm just a little dizzy. It's...
我没事, 我的朋友. 我只是有点头晕. 只是...

736
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:48,662
It's terrible up there, you know,
Swann, you've no idea.
上面情况太糟糕了, 你知道吗, Swann, 你都想不到

737
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,462
Right, I am ready.
好了, 我准备好了

738
00:48:57,506 --> 00:48:59,914
But I still don't understand what's happened to Fariah.
但我还是没搞懂 Fariah 发生了什么

739
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:01,827
She went the wrong way. We lost her.
她走错路了, 我们弄丢她了

740
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:03,956
Well we must find her!
You don't seem to realize how vital it is.
那我们必须找到她! 你似乎没有意识到这有多关键

741
00:49:04,092 --> 00:49:05,887
Doctor, hold still a moment will you?
博士, 稳住一会儿, 好吗?

742

Sorry.
抱歉

743
00:49:08,037 --> 00:49:12,588
There. Look at that, Giles, isn't it amazing?
好了. 看一下, Giles, 是不是很惊人?

744
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:13,992
Salamander to the life.
活生生的 Salamander

745
00:49:14,405 --> 00:49:17,029
Yes, it's... it's not bad.
是的, 这个...挺不赖

746
00:49:17,213 --> 00:49:18,219
Shh, I think I heard something.
嘘, 我觉得我听到了什么

747
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:19,780
Perhaps it's Fariah.
有可能是 Fariah

748
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:27,589
Stay where you are. I've been looking forward
to meeting you again.
呆着别动. 我一直期待着再次见到你

749
00:49:27,813 --> 00:49:31,455
Over there... No, not you.
过去那边...不, 你不去

750
00:49:33,913 --> 00:49:36,855
Sit down, all of you.
坐下, 你们全部

751
00:49:37,154 --> 00:49:39,873
Incredible. You fooled me the first time we met,
不可思议. 我们第一次碰面时你骗过了我...

752
00:49:39,994 --> 00:49:44,223
but now, even Salamander himself
would think he was looking in a mirror.
看看现在, 就算 Salamander 他自己也会以为他在照镜子

753
00:49:44,254 --> 00:49:49,123
Why? You want this man to impersonate Salamander, why?
为什么? 你想让这个人假冒 Salamander, 为什么?

754
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:52,423
How much are they paying you?
他们付给你多少钱?

755
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:53,503
I beg your pardon?
你说什么?

756
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:56,220
They want you to assassinate Salamander,
don't they? Take his place?
他们想让你刺杀 Salamander, 对吧? 取而代之?

757
00:49:57,072 --> 00:49:58,820
That's ridiculous! I couldn't possibly do that.
简直荒唐! 我不可能干出这种事情

758
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,179
But you were preparing to impersonate him, weren't you?
但你早就在准备假冒他, 是吧?

759
00:50:01,392 --> 00:50:02,178
Well well, yes.
噢好吧, 是的

760
00:50:02,326 --> 00:50:03,946
Alright then, why?
那好了, 为什么?

761
00:50:04,122 --> 00:50:08,704
Because Salamander holds my two friends prisoner
and I was going to attempt to rescue them.
因为 Salamander 关押了我的两个朋友, 我是打算营救他们

762
00:50:08,966 --> 00:50:13,861
And at the same time get evidence
that would expose Salamander...
与此同时, 找到证据, 可以用来揭发 Salamander...

763
00:50:13,966 --> 00:50:17,461
...as a traitor, blackmailer and murderer!
...证明他是个卖国贼, 勒索犯, 凶手!

764
00:50:17,657 --> 00:50:20,306
Quite an ambitious plan.
How do you know such evidence exists?
计划很有野心嘛. 你怎么知道这种证据存在呢?

765
00:50:20,478 --> 00:50:21,719
It exists in Salamander's records.
它存在于 Salamander 的档案室

766
00:50:21,908 --> 00:50:24,365
Oh, yes, I know why you want Salamander out of the way.
哦, 是的, 我知道你为什么要除掉 Salamander

767
00:50:24,478 --> 00:50:30,365
You hate him because he exposed
your profitable sideline of misusing public money.
你恨他, 因为他揭露了你那盈利颇丰的副业是挪用公款办的

768
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,958
Oh, it was Salamander who was misusing the money.
噢, Salamander 才是挪用公款的人

769
00:50:33,107 --> 00:50:36,334
And I was dismissed from my post and
the evidence against Salamander concealed.
然后我就被从位子上赶下来, 对 Salamander 不利的证据就不见了

770
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,129
So you say. But you've no evidence at all
against Salamander, have you?
这是你的说法. 但你没有针对 Salamander 的任何证据, 有吗?

771
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,485
I tell you the evidence is in Salamander's records.
我告诉你证据就在 Salamander 的档案室

772
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:44,462
And I'm expected to take that from you?
而你就指望我信了你的邪?

773
00:50:44,578 --> 00:50:46,935
We do hold evidence...
我们的确有证据...

774
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:50,306
that Salamander isn't quite
so pure and white as he's painted.
证明 Salamander 并不像他自己所粉刷的那么清白

775
00:50:50,498 --> 00:50:51,839
No? What?
不清白? 什么证据?

776
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:55,599
A file, containing certain information
about a gentleman called Fedorin.
一份文件, 里面有关于一位叫 Fedorin 的先生的一些信息

777
00:50:56,164 --> 00:51:00,085
Salamander was going to
use this evidence against Fedorin.
Salamander 本打算用这个证据来对付 Fedorin

778
00:51:00,164 --> 00:51:04,585
Blackmail him into submission.
after he'd got rid of Denes, that is.
勒索他逼他就范 — 就在他除掉 Denes 之后

779
00:51:04,826 --> 00:51:06,768
And so gain control of another zone.
这样就可以得到又一个区的控制权

780
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,148
Where is this file?
这份文件在哪里?

781
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:10,851
Fariah has it, Salamander's food taster.
Fariah 手上, Salamander 的食物品尝员

782
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:14,340
Fariah? But she's dead.
Fariah? 但她已经死了

783
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:17,715
Dead? But how?
死了? 怎么死的?

784
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:20,111
She was shot by one of Benik's guards, escaping arrest.
她被 Benik 的一个警卫击中了, 在逃避追捕的时候

785
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:24,513
Escaping arrest? Benik had her killed,
逃避追捕? 是 Benik 让人杀了她

786
00:51:24,616 --> 00:51:26,613
because she had evidence against Salamander.
因为她有 Salamander 的证据

787
00:51:26,723 --> 00:51:29,398
And Benik will return the file to Salamander.
然后 Benik 会把文件交回给 Salamander

788
00:51:29,493 --> 00:51:31,198
We must get to the Research Station.
我们必须赶到研究站去

789
00:51:31,285 --> 00:51:32,534
You're not going anywhere or doing anything.
你哪儿也不能去, 什么也不能做

790
00:51:32,685 --> 00:51:35,634
As far as I'm concerned, this story you've told me
could be a pack of lies...
就我看来, 你告诉我的这个故事可能只是一堆谎言...

791
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:38,334
to cover your attempt to assassinate Salamander.
只为了给你企图刺杀 Salamander 找借口

792
00:51:38,485 --> 00:51:43,334
Now I'm not saying I'm altogether satisfied with
Salamander or his organisation,
我现在倒不是说我全然赞同 Salamander 和他的安排

793
00:51:43,455 --> 00:51:45,634
but I'll investigate in my own way.
但我会用自己的方式进行调查

794
00:51:45,889 --> 00:51:49,059
Meanwhile Salamander will have found a way to cover himself,
与此同时 Salamander 会找到方法为他自己打掩护

795
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,699
and also a way of disposing of you.
You're digging your own grave, Bruce.
还能找到方法干掉你. 你是在自掘坟墓, Bruce

796
00:51:52,907 --> 00:51:55,964
That's my affair. And I do things my own way.
那是我的事. 我做事情有我自己的方法

797
00:51:56,982 --> 00:51:59,594
And I do things my way.

798
00:52:00,054 --> 00:52:04,197
Really, as Head of Security,
you should have more reliable guards.
真的, 作为安全主管, 你应该有一些更可靠的护卫

799
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:09,350
- Leader Salamander?
- Still inside, sir.

So you've brought them?
Good. Any trouble?
看来你把他们带过来了?  很好, 遇到麻烦没?

803
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,865
No, a light drug saw to that.

Yes sir.
好的长官

I'm looking forward to questioning them.
I have the feeling they're going to be stubborn.
我很期待能审讯他们. 我有一种感觉他们会很顽固

807
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,870
So much more interesting when our prisoners are stubborn.
我们的囚犯很顽固的时候, 乐趣就多了

808
00:52:41,706 --> 00:52:45,748
You're only making trouble for yourself.
Killing me won't get you anywhere.
你这只是在给自己找麻烦. 杀了我不会给你带来任何好处

809
00:52:45,837 --> 00:52:49,951
We have to get to the Research Station,
and you're not going to stop us.
我们必须赶去研究站, 你不能阻止我们

810
00:52:50,055 --> 00:52:51,693
But you're completely surrounded.
但你们被完全包围了

811
00:52:51,805 --> 00:52:54,893
You don't really believe I came here
with just one guard, do you?
你不会真的相信我只带了一个警卫就过来了吧, 是吗?

812
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,393
You'd be very silly to try and fight your way out.
你要是想试着硬闯出去就太傻了

813
00:52:58,505 --> 00:53:02,253
I'd give you about... thirty seconds to live if you try.
我会让你们活大约...30秒, 你们不妨一试

814
00:53:02,356 --> 00:53:04,338
Alright Bruce, we might have just thirty seconds
好了 Bruce, 我们可能只有 30 秒

815

but you'd have exactly half that time, if you were lucky!
但你只有那一半时间, 还得运气好!

Please, Mister Kent!
You're forgetting one very important thing.

- What?  - Me.

818
00:53:10,696 --> 00:53:13,956
Without me you haven't got an earthly chance
of getting in that control centre.
没有我的话, 你进入那个控制中心的机会一丁点也没有

819
00:53:14,047 --> 00:53:14,781
So?

00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:18,178
I told you before,
I will not have anything to do with violence!

And what about your two friends?

822
00:53:19,644 --> 00:53:21,737
Are you going to leave them
to the tender mercies of Salamander?
你就打算让他们俩完全指望 Salamander 的仁慈?

823
00:53:21,843 --> 00:53:25,224
No I am not. May I?
不, 我不会. 可以吗?

824
00:53:25,412 --> 00:53:28,292
- What?  - Please? Just trust me.
- 怎么?  - 拜托? 尽管相信我

825
00:53:28,769 --> 00:53:34,088
Now then, I think you agree that
at this moment your life is in my hands.

826
00:53:37,961 --> 00:53:38,954
What are you doing?
你要做什么?

827
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:39,941
Hold it.
拿住它

828
00:53:40,127 --> 00:53:43,056
It's alright, Mister Bruce isn't going
to shoot anyone, are you?
没事的, Bruce 先生不会朝任何人开枪的, 对吗?

829
00:53:43,283 --> 00:53:46,068
Why? Why'd you do that?
为什么? 为什么你要这么做?

830
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:49,810
Because I think I know what sort of man you are
- honest and reasonable.
因为我觉得我知道你是哪种人 - 诚实而理性

831
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:51,376
Go on.

832
00:53:51,682 --> 00:53:55,817

Now I want you to trust me.
我把枪还给你是因为我相信你. 现在我要你也相信我

833
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:59,416
You must be a complete fool, or very clever.
你肯定是个完全的傻子, 或者是极其聪明

834
00:53:59,685 --> 00:54:03,136
Well I'm afraid you will have to
make up your mind to that right away.

Do you believe Kent's accusations against Salamander?
你相信 Kent 对 Salamander 的控诉吗?

I think there's reasonable doubt about
Salamander's personal integrity,

but there's only one way to get proof.

By getting into Salamander's Research Station?

Yes. And my two young friends may have some information.

And if there isn't any evidence?
但如果没有任何证据呢?

843
00:54:24,952 --> 00:54:28,950
Then you'll be perfectly free to arrest us
and put us in prison, won't you?
那你就完全可以逮捕我们, 把我们扔进监狱, 行吗?

844
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:33,249
Alright, I'll do it, on one condition.

不, Kent, 你必须呆在这里. 我要是相信你就是疯了
