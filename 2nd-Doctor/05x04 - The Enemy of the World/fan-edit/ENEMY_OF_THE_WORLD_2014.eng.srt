(Sincro: bamanzi)

4
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,916
Oh, there's nothing like a dip to freshen you up.

5
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,213
Hey, that's a funny looking boat.

6
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,767
It's not a boat, it's a hovercraft.

7
00:00:51,904 --> 00:00:52,646
Eh?

8
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,437
You're right, it is him.

9
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,529
What are we going to do?

10
00:00:57,563 --> 00:01:00,371
A terrifying thing. It's like a sea monster.

11
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:02,473
Oh, we'll soon get a closer look, it's coming nearer.

12
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:05,760
Oh yes. Yes.

13
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:12,060
I don't think I like the look of this. Let's go.

14
00:01:12,144 --> 00:01:14,256
- Why, what's the matter?  - Come on, run!

15
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:16,133
- Yeah, but...  - Don't argue, run.

16
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,700
Over here!

17
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,600
Hurry!

18
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,816
Incredible.

19
00:05:53,656 --> 00:05:56,716
Absolutely incredible.

20
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:58,830
I'm not a specimen in a glass bowl, you know?

21
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:00,460
Ah, I'm sorry. Do sit down.

22
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:01,578
Oh, thank you.

23
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:06,634
It's just so astonishing. You are Salamander.

24
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:07,563
Do you see what I mean?

25
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,210
But surely you know how alike you are?

26
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:11,010
After all, Salamander is a world figure.

27
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,807
Well... well my friends and I, we..

28
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,577
we've been out of touch...
with civilisation for a while.

29
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:19,577
We're visitors, so to speak, um.
On ice shall we say.

30
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,090
I see. Where shall I start?

31
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:26,785
At the beginning please.
We've been subjected to a number of attacks

32
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:29,785
because I look like this Salamander of yours.

33
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:34,785
I'm not surprised. I'll show you why.

34
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:37,149
I have a video wire of Salamander,

35
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:40,549
addressing the United Zones Conference on World Food.

36
00:06:40,622 --> 00:06:46,079
And meanwhile, over at the United Zones General Assembly,
from all over the world delegates are flocking in,

37
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:50,219
eager to hear the latest report from Leader Salamander.

38
00:06:50,499 --> 00:07:01,871
The progress, Mr President, of the Sun Conservation
establishment at Kanowa, in the Australasian Zone is...

39
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:07,188
...I'm delighted to report highly satisfactory.

40
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:14,696
But we cannot yet guarantee good summer holidays for all.

41
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:22,189
However, we have now in orbit the Mark VII Sun Catcher...

42
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:29,939
and already we have been able to
concentrate the sun's rays into much needed areas.

43
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:35,939
The great Canadian wheat plains are safe.

44
00:07:37,388 --> 00:07:44,391
And now, Mr President: Ukraine - the grain field of the planet -

45
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:49,191
an unfortunate area between Bucava and Kirovograd

46
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:54,191
devastated by the elements two short years ago.

47
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:58,391
What have I got to say to you about that?

48
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:06,591
I can tell you that on both banks of the Dnieper river
the corn is ripening in the sun!

49
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:15,191
And ten-thousand robot harvesters are moving down
to gather in fifty million tons of flour!

50
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,860
There's nothing there to say he's a bad man.

51
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:22,141
I quite agree, Victoria.
He seems to be a public benefactor.

52
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:24,741
Quite a speaker too and remarkably handsome,
didn't you think so Jamie?

53
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:26,856
He's one of the most popular men on the planet.

54
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:28,856
Many people call him the shopkeeper of the world.

55
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:30,956
The saviour, in fact, some of them.

56
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,158
Well what's he saved the world from?

57
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:34,741
Starvation - too many people, too little food.

58
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,305
Until Salamander invented his Sun Store.
Surely you've heard? You must know?

59
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:40,185
Oh yes, well of course we've heard something.

60
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:44,813
The Sun Store collects the rays from the sun
and stores them in concentrated form.

61
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,596
Oh, like the ioniser, Doctor?

62
00:08:46,755 --> 00:08:48,572
Yes, a rather different principle I think, Jamie.

63
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,265
Well never mind how it works! What's it for?

64
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:55,729
Salamander can force-grow three,
sometimes four, crops in one summer.

65
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:57,395
Well why do these men want to kill him.

66
00:08:57,434 --> 00:08:59,395
I mean, one minute you say he's saving the world, the next...

67
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:03,749
For his own ends! Step by step
he's taking control of this planet.

68
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,338
You have proof of this?

69
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:11,300
Some, yes. I was once a high official
in the World Zone Authority

70
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:16,600
Deputy Security Leader for North Africa and Europe,
but Salamander discredited and ruined me

71
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:19,600
because he realized I was beginning to get suspicious.

72
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:22,879
But you could be making up stories about Salamander!
Out of revenge.

73
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:29,674
Yes, I suppose so. Then you can judge for yourself.

74
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:36,404
You remember Michael Assevski -
he was Controller of the Eastern European Zone?

75
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:42,374
He was drowned at sea a mile from shore.
(s/Shockingly/Hockingham,/) murdered!

76
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:47,474
All of them were seen with Salamander,
or a man known as his deputy

77
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:49,474
shortly before their deaths.

78
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:52,946
All of them were replaced by men
known to be in Salamander's power.

79
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:54,796
- Known by who?   - By me, Doctor.

80
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,357
Well why don't you tell the authorities,
the police or whatever?

81
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,582
Because I'm discredited, don't you see?

82
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,082
Because Salamander is so popular,

83
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:04,582
and also because the man that took my place,
a man named Donald Bruce...

84
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:06,582
...has since risen to become overall security chief.

85
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:08,411
Surely there is someone you can take your story to?

86
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:13,956
Ah yes, Helvig believed me.
So did Assevski, and they're dead.

87
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:17,406
However, there is one other man,
a man named Alexander Denes,

88
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:20,056
but none of them will do anything until it's too late!

89
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:22,007
I'm surprised.

90
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:27,007
Well if Salamander is everything you say he is,
then why hasn't he tried to...

91
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:28,736
- Dispose of me?  - Yes

92
00:10:28,822 --> 00:10:30,662
Well he has, but he's afraid.

93
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:33,662
You see, the testimony of a dead man
still holds legal weight.

94
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:38,508
Oh, I see. Well, it seems we have a problem on our hands...

95
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,608
...whether to believe Mr Kent or not.

96
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,413
Well there is one way that you can find out for yourselves.

97
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,223
Oh, how?

98
00:10:42,338 --> 00:10:43,624
Impersonate Salamander.

99
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:45,874
Yes I thought that's what we were leading up to.

100
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,885
Well I must admit, Doctor, you do look like him.

101
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:48,826
Exactly like him.

102
00:10:48,942 --> 00:10:50,641
Yes, there's more to it than that. What about the voice?

103
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:52,682
Well it's nearly the same pitch, only the accent.

104
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:55,190
Only the accent! My dear young lady.

105
00:10:55,222 --> 00:11:01,790
Oh dear. Now what was it he said...

106
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:08,490
We still cannot guarantee good summer holidays for all.

107
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:13,270
No. Guarantee... no, no, no... guaran... guarantee.
You see, it's very difficult.

108
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:18,070
Hmm, of course I always was interested in phonetics

109
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:20,670
Holidays... summer... summer.

110
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:25,410
He must have come from Mexico,
Quintana Roo or Yucatan or somewhere...

111
00:11:25,504 --> 00:11:28,909
That's incredible, Doctor, he was born at Merida,
state capital of Yucatan.

112
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:32,658
Yes, there are other very strong influences though.

113
00:11:32,757 --> 00:11:36,458
Oh, I could do it in time.
But what if I did it, what then?

114
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:39,665
You could walk into Salamander's research station at Kanowa,

115
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:43,765
find out how he's getting control of the separate
World Zones, and then bring out absolute proof.

116
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:51,129
Yes. I see.

117
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:56,165
How long did you say it would take you
to master Salamander's accent?

118
00:11:56,421 --> 00:12:00,009
I didn't. It would take three weeks, perhaps four.

119
00:12:00,206 --> 00:12:03,339
Well while we've been talking,
the Security Chief I told you about,

120
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:06,639
Donald Bruce, has since cordoned off this entire area.

121
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,939
He's coming here himself...Now!

122
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:12,939
I'd say you've got about two minutes, Doctor.

123
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:13,894
But that's out of the question!

124
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,828
You know what he'll do as soon as he sees you,/?

125
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,528
a man who resembles Salamander so closely?

126
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,352
- Oh that's not fair!
- Will you please listen!

127
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:23,585
You'll be under arrest for impersonation
as soon as he sees you. I mean it.

128
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:25,134
But isn't there another way out of this?

129
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:26,937
Only one - be Salamander.

130
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:27,970
But the clothes!

131
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:32,700
Yes, there are some in here.
A little less eccentric, but do the best you can.

132
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:34,038
I won't! I can't!

133
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:35,399
Your friends, Doctor, do you want them to suffer?

134
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:37,199
Because they will, you know.

135
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,704
No, wait a minute! Why is a man like Bruce coming here?

136
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:40,909
Don't push me, there isn't time.

137
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:43,343
You sent for him, didn't you? You tipped him off!

138
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,525
I couldn't miss an opportunity like this,
now please come on.

139
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,024
Giles, for heaven's sake, what have you done?
It's far too risky.

140
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:01,820
Hello Kent. Doing some recruiting are you?

141
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:04,420
A bit young for killers, aren't they?

142
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:05,975
What do you mean?

143
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:07,832
All right, what do you mean by stepping in here like this?

144
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:11,632
Anytime, Kent. I've got the right and you know it.
Anytime I like.

145
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:15,469
All right, what do you want?

146
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,752
That's better, you're ex-security,
you know the way it's got to go.

147
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:20,952
We might as well be nice and civil about it, mightn't we?

148
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:26,548
That bungalow in Cedar District. In your name, right?

149
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:27,497
Why?

150
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:31,781
Do I have to tell you?
There's been an awful nasty mess out there.

151
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:34,481
Someone has got himself shot in your living room.

152
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:37,843
- And who are you two?  - Jamie McCrimmon

153
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:39,326
- And?  - Victoria Waterfield

154
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:41,666
- What's the matter, can't you speak?
- Don't shout at me.

155
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,748
Oh, very good, the outraged public citizen.

156
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:47,128
- Do they know who I am?
- Yes they do.

157
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:49,636
A pity, I like to hear you say it.

158
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:52,436
Now listen to this, all of you.

159
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:56,936
One of your men was murdered in a bungalow rented to you.

160
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:59,736
The remains of two others were found
in what was left of a helicopter.

161
00:13:59,849 --> 00:14:02,336
You were in that bungalow at the time.

162
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:07,136
And there were three other people with you,
two youngsters and a man. Right?

163
00:14:08,235 --> 00:14:10,143
Now, there was another man, wasn't there?

164
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:13,343
So we'll deal with that first? Where is he?

165
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:34,754
Why hello Bruce, what are you doing here, huh?

166
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:40,077
I was under the impression
you were in the Central European Zone, Leader.

167
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:43,483
That's what you were meant to believe.

168
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:44,342
Why?

169
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,452
I do not care to be questioned by my own security!

170
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:52,903
Well that's just it. How can I possibly
maintain security when you behave like this?

171
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,003
I'm at least entitled to know your movements.

172
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:58,209
You have a policeman's mind, Bruce.

173
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:02,516
That may be! Only a few days ago you questioned me
about this man and his activities.

174
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:06,116
And we agreed that he was dangerous!
Now, I find you in his office.

175
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:12,654
Sometimes I like to deal with matters in my own way.

176
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:16,615
- They're not holding you here?  - Holding me?

177
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:18,449
Under some threat or other.

178
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:20,475
No one threatens Salamander!

179
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:23,032
I still think I deserve an explanation, Leader.

180
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:26,526
Yes, of course, you shall have it.

181
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:31,526
But not now. When I return from the Central European Zone.

182
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,080
Very well.

183
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,254
Now what about the dead man found in your bungalow.

184
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,254
He was one of your lot, wasn't he?

185
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:45,923
Yes. Um, he was trying to protect me.
The other two wanted to kill me.

186
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:49,404
Now why should they want to do that
to a nice young girl like you?

187
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:50,629
Well I...

188
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,881
Obviously they thought I was there.

189
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:55,616
You?

190
00:15:55,718 --> 00:15:57,817
Yes, Bruce, just like you,
a lot of people don't like me.

191
00:15:57,911 --> 00:16:01,551
Don't get clever with me, Kent!
I've a good mind to...

192
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,352
I am prepared to accept his story.

193
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:04,686
Well I'm not!

194
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:07,022
That's interesting, but not important.

195
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:09,022
I accept it! That's all that matters.

196
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:12,577
It's beginning to look as if these people
are working for you now. Is that right?

197
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:19,003
You still dare to question me!
They have information! I shall get it!

198
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,803
I will see you on my return. Now leave me!

199
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:29,540
- McCrimmon, you said?  - Aye

200
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,267
Well you just watch your step, that's all.

201
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:39,025
I never said a word.

202
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:44,239
Must be the way you look, Jamie.

203
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:45,832
You were splendid, Doctor.

204
00:16:46,064 --> 00:16:46,713
Thank you.

205
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,989
That was a dangerous game to play.

206
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:52,440
It paid off. All right, are you with us?

207
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,373
I don't know where you stand, Mr Kent.

208
00:16:55,429 --> 00:17:01,473
But you and this Salamander are obviously
on opposite sides. That at least is clear.

209
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:06,773
But which side is good? Which side is bad?
And why should I interfere?

210
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:09,878
Well you're the only man who can help save the world.

211
00:17:10,053 --> 00:17:12,523
But isn't that what Salamander's trying to do?

212
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:14,036
Don't you understand? Salamander...

213
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:17,271
Just a moment. Jamie, you're unusually quiet,
what do you think?

214
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:19,927
Well to save the world,
aye, well it sounds grand, but...

215
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,827
Oh, we couldn't turn our back
on a challenge like this, Doctor.

216
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:24,327
Well, at least I know you wouldn't.

217
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:26,520
We don't know anything about these people.

218
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,680
Astrid saved our lives.
She was wounded because of it.

219
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:30,206
- Oh but Jamie, you don't think...
- Look, she was...

220
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:32,058
Look, we're right about Salamander!

221
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:34,258
It won't take you long to find out for yourselves.

222
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:35,823
How do you propose we do that?

223
00:17:36,018 --> 00:17:37,623
He'll be well guarded for a start.

224
00:17:37,804 --> 00:17:40,048
We can hardly steal into his study
and go through his papers.

225
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:43,591
That man, Bruce, said that
he was in the Central European Zone.

226
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:45,336
It's a long way from Australia.

227
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:46,952
It's only two hours by rocket.

228
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,527
You could leave almost at once.

229
00:17:48,707 --> 00:17:50,721
- Oh, what then?  - I've had a plan ...

230
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:53,885
... for infiltrating into Salamander's
inner circle for some time.

231
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:56,485
Well I could adapt it for your two friends.

232
00:17:56,671 --> 00:17:59,747
I can arrange three travel warrants and visas.
Everything you need.

233
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:01,058
Just three?

234
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:03,365
Well one for Astrid, one for you and ah...

235
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:04,185
- Victoria.  - Of course.

236
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:07,641
Oh that's very clever of you.
How can you do that?

237
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,841
I thought you said you had no official position?

238
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:12,021
We have a contact there.

239
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:14,338
He must be a very important person.

240
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:17,637
He is. Denes, Controller of the Zone.

241
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:23,328
Oh, I see. What about me?

242
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:27,169
I think we better have a look at
Salamander's research station at Kanowa.

243
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:31,625
Yes. Ah, yes, but from a safe distance of course.

244
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,911
This is dreadful news, Salamander.
I still can't believe it.

245
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:37,376
Terrible, terrible.

246
00:18:37,903 --> 00:18:41,661
I don't say it will happen.
I say it can happen.

247
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:47,661
Your Zone is in danger, Denes.
Here, here and here.

248
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:50,019
We've had no trouble for years in those mountains.

249
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,337
You don't imagine I make it up?

250
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:52,188
No, no, of course not.

251
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:57,540
Those volcanoes have been dead
since sixteenth century. Fedorin is right to doubt.

252
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:02,973
A volcano is a strange thing, my friend.
I tell you the truth.

253
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:09,373
It's like a man in the hot sun,
sleeping... still... lifeless.

254
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:15,973
Then boom! He wakes full of energy!
I know volcanoes.

255
00:19:16,045 --> 00:19:20,675
Isn't there a possibility of a...
miscalculation for a few degrees?

256
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:24,536
I'm never wrong.
Every one of my predictions has been accurate.

257
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:28,823
Yes. You're record is good. I don't deny that.

258
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,397
You are too kind. Now will you listen to me!

259
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:33,756
Leader, the communications...

260
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:36,479
I know! I know! I told you I was not to be disturbed!

261
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:37,671
Yes, Leader.

262
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:44,277
No, wait! No, wait, Fariah, ah?

263
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:47,939
- You like some refreshment, perhaps?
- Thank you.

264
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:49,492
No, no, not for me.

265
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,669
You're going so soon?

266
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:53,632
I must consult my scientific advisors.

267
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:55,369
You still don't believe me?

268
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,384
I believe you sufficiently to want to...
have your information checked.

269
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:02,584
Before I alarm my people unnecessarily.

270
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:07,417
Your scientists won't help you.
They don't know. They are amateurs.

271
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:10,059
No, Salamander, they are not amateurs.

272
00:20:10,131 --> 00:20:13,159
They are very clever men dedicated to their work.

273
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:16,559
But they are men, capable of human error like anybody else.

274
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,591
Do what you wish.
Captain!

275
00:20:20,398 --> 00:20:21,079
Sir!

276
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,759
Controller Denes is leaving.

277
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:23,752
Yes, sir.

278
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:26,039
You will soon see that I am right.

279
00:20:26,134 --> 00:20:29,189
Oh, you will stay, ah? Have a drink.

280
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:31,939
We have a great deal to talk about, you and I.

281
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,039
Fariah, see to him.

282
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:38,768
That might be her now. Yes.

283
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:41,818
Hello, Giles? This is me, Astrid.

284
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:43,223
Right let‘s have it. What's happening?

285
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:45,571
Everything's gone fine so far.

286
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,661
And the rocket arrived right on time in Hungary.

287
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,261
And Jamie's got his entrance pass
and has started phase one.

288
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:53,525
- Do you think the boy can handle it?
- Well I hope so.

289
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:56,829
My goodness they're a pretty
odd lot though, aren't they?

290
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:58,750
Well actually the Doctor's with me right now.

291
00:20:58,981 --> 00:21:02,613
Oh, I am sorry. Oh I know...
I'm sure they'll be fine.

292
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:06,667
What news of Denes? We must keep him posted
as to what is happening.

293
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,559
It's all right, we've contacted
and we've arranged to meet.

294
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:11,448
Be careful, he's pretty well known.

295
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,809
But what on earth made you
take a job as a food taster?

296
00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:15,948
She was hungry.

297
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:19,498
Only thing is, now she has all the food she needs,

298
00:21:19,593 --> 00:21:21,948
...she has lost her appetite.
Give me a drink!

299
00:21:22,288 --> 00:21:23,588
You are well protected.

300
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:24,634
Um.

301
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:33,535
Very well protected.
Be calm. Sit down, drink your drink.

302
00:21:33,598 --> 00:21:34,400
Ah!

303
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:41,960
Thank you for calling the guard.
I was wondering what to do about him.

304
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:44,661
Now don't move for that box!
Not if you value your life.

305
00:21:44,732 --> 00:21:48,961
Now all of you, back over there! That's it.

306
00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:53,061
Not as well protected as you think you are, eh?

307
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:59,061
Now when I say duck... Duck, get down!

308
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:17,143
Look at this! What do you do boys, eh?

309
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:21,043
Read? Sleep? It's a fine thing.

310
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,843
Here we have an attempt to destroy me
and where are you?

311
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:27,843
It's not so good, boys.
It's not so good. I'm watching you.

312
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:33,443
Look after him. Better still, get rid of him.

313
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:40,343
- What's all this about. Eh?
- I heard two men talking.

314
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:43,592
They said they'd planted a bomb of some kind
in your radio telephone.

315
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:45,792
I tried to warn them at the gates,
but they wouldn't pay any attention.

316
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:48,404
So you break in? How you break in?

317
00:22:48,518 --> 00:22:50,371
Well I'm here on holiday with a friend.

318
00:22:50,418 --> 00:22:53,471
She's very pretty, so the guard
didn't see me slip past him.

319
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:57,836
Why didn't you call out and warn me?
I nearly used the radio telephone several times.

320
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,432
Ah you'd have had me shot, most like.

321
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:03,107
Why do you risk your skin to save me?

322
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:06,197
Well without you
the Earth hasn't much of a chance, has it?

323
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:15,149
You like to work for me, eh? You like that?

324
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:17,298
Oh no, you don't have to do that.
I mean, you owe me nothing.

325
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:18,616
You're quite right, boy.

326
00:23:18,756 --> 00:23:20,058
And I'm on holiday.

327
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:22,061
You won't find what I pay you disappointing.

328
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:24,984
Aye, there's my girlfriend too though.

329
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,417
Oh we might be able to find something for her.
Eh Fariah?

330
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,302
Yes, your chef could use an assistant.

331
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:31,760
See to it. What do you say, eh?

332
00:23:31,902 --> 00:23:33,376
Well I'll give it a go.

333
00:23:33,492 --> 00:23:35,476
But I'll say this though,
your security system's rotten.

334
00:23:35,502 --> 00:23:37,076
There'll have to be changes.

335
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:39,079
Oh what a boy, ah?

336
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:42,979
Fariah, see he gets some proper uniform
instead of this skirt.

337
00:23:43,335 --> 00:23:45,697
And bring him and his girlfriend to see me.

338
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:47,126
Come along then.

339
00:23:49,535 --> 00:23:52,816
What an extraordinary young man.

340
00:23:53,027 --> 00:23:55,546
I prize loyalty very highly, my friend.

341
00:23:55,627 --> 00:24:00,846
And I repay it very generously.
Like I do the girl Fariah, eh.

342
00:24:17,012 --> 00:24:20,455
I used to love to do this sort of thing when I was a boy.

343
00:24:20,764 --> 00:24:23,063
I'm sorry. It was the safest place I could think of.

344
00:24:23,202 --> 00:24:24,778
Oh, it's all right. I'm still fit enough.

345
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,234
Thank you for getting me the necessary documents.

346
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:29,463
Have you been successful?

347
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:31,745
So far. Salamander's swallowed it.

348
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:32,980
I thought he would.

349
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:35,800
The boy's very confident.
The girl, not so much.

350
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:40,005
See, the point is that I'm near enough
to him to pick out something.

351
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:42,805
This was the first time I met Salamander.

352
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,805
I must say that you were right about him, Astrid.

353
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,080
We must get rid of him. He must be stopped.

354
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:51,355
He will be stopped!
I'm returning to Giles Kent.

355
00:24:51,481 --> 00:24:53,845
Can you wait till we can take action?

356
00:24:54,497 --> 00:24:56,791
Oh, with a bit of luck, yes.

357
00:24:58,051 --> 00:25:01,870
Fedorin, would he betray you in some way?

358
00:25:02,689 --> 00:25:05,395
I'm trying to think of some reason why he should.

359
00:25:05,697 --> 00:25:08,826
But these are all lies, Salamander. Lies, I assure you.

360
00:25:08,982 --> 00:25:09,991
So you say.

361
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:12,895
What are you going to do? My family... my friends.

362
00:25:15,296 --> 00:25:19,007
My dear man. My dear Fedorin.

363
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:25,307
You don't suppose I intend to
make your swindling public, eh?

364
00:25:25,496 --> 00:25:32,007
This is... this just an insurance, um.
Sit down, forget it.

365
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:37,007
I tell you what I'm going to do for you.

366
00:25:37,387 --> 00:25:38,139
What?

367
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:42,254
You are going to replace Denes
as controller of this Zone.

368
00:25:42,496 --> 00:25:45,754
But, don't say anything.
I'll know you'll accept.

369
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:47,518
What do you want?

370
00:25:48,308 --> 00:25:52,568
I'll tell you. There will be disaster in this Zone.

371
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:54,532
I cannot stop the disaster,

372
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:59,568
but I can come to the aid of this Zone
when it's happened.

373
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:01,952
And take over? I see.

374
00:26:02,052 --> 00:26:04,990
- The Zone would be yours!
- Oh ours, Fedorin, ours.

375
00:26:05,008 --> 00:26:07,816
It's a partnership I'm offering you.

376
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:12,816
Either you have half of everything, or you have nothing.

377
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,457
But there's Alexander Denes.

378
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:18,922
Oh yes, the popular, well beloved Denes.

379
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:21,873
- What a pity.  - Pity?

380
00:26:21,977 --> 00:26:25,140
Oh didn't I tell you, Denes is going to die.

381
00:26:25,307 --> 00:26:30,140
Mysteriously... an assassin... terrible.

382
00:26:31,445 --> 00:26:34,251
I can't do that! You can't ask me!

383
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:37,537
I think I can ask you to do anything I want.

384
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:42,935
My predictions are accurate!

385
00:26:48,493 --> 00:26:52,935
The entire Eperjes-Tokaj Ranges are in eruption!

386
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:07,935
Fedorin, come and look. It's very pretty.

387
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:12,935
The history of Hungary is about to be rewritten!

388
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:16,592
Salamander.

389
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,288
What are you doing here, Bruce?

390
00:27:18,416 --> 00:27:20,594
I had a report there was trouble here,
an attempt on your life.

391
00:27:20,695 --> 00:27:22,175
It was nothing. Come and look.

392
00:27:37,277 --> 00:27:40,978
Terrible. Those poor people.

393
00:27:41,397 --> 00:27:44,026
Salamander! What have you done?

394
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:45,653
I warned you!

395
00:27:45,785 --> 00:27:49,743
You couldn't have known!
You've done this somehow yourself!

396
00:27:50,327 --> 00:27:53,808
The man is mad! Worse still he is incompetent!

397
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:57,258
I warned this man that this zone
was in danger of natural disaster...

398
00:27:57,351 --> 00:28:00,551
...and he did nothing!
Issued no cautions to the public.

399
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:03,509
You deliberately allowed your people to suffer and die!

400
00:28:03,578 --> 00:28:04,509
You're a traitor!

401
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:07,960
You're a traitor! You contrived this for your own ends.

402
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:10,921
Bruce, I order you to arrest this man.

403
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:16,439
But this is nonsense. Fedorin, you were here.

404
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:18,389
You know this is nonsense.

405
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:20,513
Denes you are too naive.

406
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,713
At your trial, Fedorin will be
the chief witness against you!

407
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:28,357
You've done very well so far, Fedorin.

408
00:28:28,647 --> 00:28:30,957
It's nothing but a blackmail.

409
00:28:31,027 --> 00:28:34,044
Blackmail? What have I threaten you with? Nothing!

410
00:28:34,207 --> 00:28:36,198
No, but you would if I refused.

411
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:38,756
Fedorin, I keep on telling you,

412
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:43,762
this is just a form of comprehensive insurance, hm?

413
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:46,441
There's nothing for you to worry about.

414
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:50,998
My dear man, I've done nothing
but praise you ever since we first met.

415
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:55,638
I said you should be European Controller.
I said I would support you.

416
00:28:55,807 --> 00:28:58,641
You've found out things about me,
lies that would damage me.

417
00:28:58,707 --> 00:29:00,925
On the contrary, I am doing you a good turn.

418
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:03,625
I am actually suppressing facts about you.

419
00:29:03,687 --> 00:29:08,145
- Lies, I tell you!
- Lies... Truth... Who knows?

420
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:12,405
But we wouldn't like to put them to the test, would we?

421
00:29:18,487 --> 00:29:20,478
There.

422
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:22,988
What's this?

423
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:28,681
Used in the right way, at the right time,
it can dictate your own future

424
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:31,725
and the future of Alexander Denes.

425
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:33,525
Poison?

426
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:34,698
I want you to take a message...

427
00:29:34,985 --> 00:29:39,998
- McCrimmon! What are you doing dressed like this?
- Leader's orders.

428
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:42,898
Now that you're here, I've got some questions
I want to ask you.

429
00:29:42,997 --> 00:29:44,456
I have better things to do, thank you.

430
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:47,137
I want to know what Salamander and Giles Kent
were discussing

431
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:50,237
- when I saw you last time?
- It's not for me to tell you that.

432
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:51,956
I am concerned of Salamander's safety.

433
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:53,956
Giles Kent is supposed to be his bitter enemy.

434
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:57,756
If Salamander wishes you to know that,
I dare say he'll tell you himself.

435
00:29:57,853 --> 00:29:59,732
You'll get no confidential out of me.

436
00:30:00,547 --> 00:30:03,652
Listen. You must go away from here.

437
00:30:03,747 --> 00:30:05,782
Don't get caught up in Salamander's world.

438
00:30:05,947 --> 00:30:08,940
Why? What do you mean?
You sound as if you don't like him.

439
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,106
- Like him? I ...
- Oh, hello there.

440
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,542
Finish writing those menus.

441
00:30:16,427 --> 00:30:18,183
- Did you hear that?
- Aye. Work on her.

442
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:20,156
I have a feeling she can tell us something about Salamander.

443
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:21,901
All right. As soon as I can.
What have you been doing?

444
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,056
I managed to slip out
and tell Astrid everything that's happened.

445
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,403
- You might have told me, Jamie!
- There wasn't time.

446
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:28,400
- She's trying to get Denes away.
- And take him to the Doctor?

447
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,400
- He'd believe Denes.
- Aye, he would.

448
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,927
How can she get in?
Salamander's got guards are everywhere.

449
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:34,899
She's got friends here.
They're going to arrange passes...

450
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:37,562
- and the right sort of uniform.
- What sort of uniform?

451
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,518
I don't know. Messenger delivery
or something. Ssh!

452
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:40,917
Controller Denes has been arrested.

453
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:46,917
I can't make up my mind whether Fedorin
is to be regarded as a new Controller or not.

454
00:30:47,087 --> 00:30:49,979
The burden of office is heavy, my friend.
I remember when I was...

455
00:30:50,007 --> 00:30:51,440
Alright. They've gone.

456
00:30:52,007 --> 00:30:55,606
Astrid and Giles Kent were quite right.
Salamander IS an evil man.

457
00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:59,355
- I can somehow sense it from all the people here.
- He's bad, all right.

458
00:30:59,447 --> 00:31:03,321
He's had Denes arrested,
and has Fedorin eating out of his hand.

459
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,841
Why should he do that?

460
00:31:04,987 --> 00:31:07,241
Remove the honest man, and put a weaker man in his place

461
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:11,082
but somehow have a hold on him,
That way Salamander can take over the territory.

462
00:31:11,247 --> 00:31:15,081
I see - when everything's in a turmoil
because of the earthquakes.

463
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:17,363
Aye, and that's lucky to say the least.

464
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:24,237
But you don't really believe that Salamander
could cause earthquakes, do you?

465
00:31:40,187 --> 00:31:42,780
I'm certain Salamander's causing the earthquakes, Doctor

466
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:45,580
and I'm sure your friends Jamie and Victoria
will tell you how bad he really is.

467
00:31:45,747 --> 00:31:47,465
But why make earthquakes?

468
00:31:47,627 --> 00:31:52,060
Years ago, when one country wanted to invade another,
it set about attacking the confidence of that country,

469
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:54,906
throwing it into confusion, making it weak.
Then it was right for take over.

470
00:31:55,053 --> 00:31:56,906
Now, isn't that exactly what's happening here,
only in a different way?

471
00:31:57,067 --> 00:32:00,478
What you're saying is that Salamander has found a way...

472
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,774
...to harness the natural forces of the Earth.

473
00:32:02,947 --> 00:32:07,896
That's a little difficult to accept.
I'm not saying it's impossible, mind you.

474
00:32:09,347 --> 00:32:14,785
You say it's coming from the research station.
Salamander's research station, eh?

475
00:32:14,947 --> 00:32:17,700
That's what I believe, in spite of...
Ssh! Wait a minute.

476
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:24,500
In spite of a number of reasons,
he invented the sun-store, a brilliant advance.

477
00:32:24,597 --> 00:32:27,453
He found a way of directing conserved energy
to areas starved of sun.

478
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:30,823
- What made you suspicious?
- The money he was spending ast the Research Station

479
00:32:30,987 --> 00:32:33,560
The materials involved, the food stores.
It didn't make sense.

480
00:32:33,735 --> 00:32:37,032
- I had all the papers, all the requisition orders.
- But that's valuable evidence!

481
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:40,503
All destroyed, and new ones appeared...
I was made out to be the criminal!

482
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,996
All by suggestion, of course. I was discredited.

483
00:32:43,287 --> 00:32:45,838
I couldn't do it, Salamander. I couldn't do it.

484
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,919
I stood there with this man's life in my hands.

485
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:51,521
This powder - I couldn't use it.

486
00:32:51,687 --> 00:32:55,157
I gave you the chance
to become something. Somebody.

487
00:32:55,327 --> 00:32:58,558
- You failed to take it, huh
- There must be some other way.

488
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:03,601
Of course, my friend. Don't worry.

489
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:05,678
- What?  - Don't worry.

490
00:33:05,847 --> 00:33:07,840
You try, you fail - so what?

491
00:33:07,947 --> 00:33:09,940
The moon doesn't fall out of the sky!

492
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:13,124
Come and sit down. Have a drink, huh?

493
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:17,443
Cheer up. We'll find another way.

494
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:19,279
I really did try.

495
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:20,960
Of course you did.

496
00:33:21,427 --> 00:33:22,719
Don't worry.

497
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:24,957
Forget it, huh?

498
00:33:25,127 --> 00:33:27,721
I have an alternative.

499
00:33:28,847 --> 00:33:30,280
Your health.

500
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:37,160
I hope you will appreciate this wine.
It's made for me especially in Alaska.

501
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:49,602
One chance, my friend.

502
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:51,917
I said one chance!

503
00:33:52,087 --> 00:33:53,823
Some trouble in the kitchens, Leader.

504
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:55,703
The new man says he's seen
someone in the kitchen gardens.

505
00:33:55,787 --> 00:33:58,603
Very well. Oh, see to that, will you?

506
00:33:58,807 --> 00:34:01,603
Suicide, of course. Such a pity.

507
00:34:03,647 --> 00:34:06,844
- I can't see anything.
- Over there by the trees!

508
00:34:07,007 --> 00:34:09,186
He's armed, too. Get down!

509
00:34:09,207 --> 00:34:10,886
I'm going out there. Stay down here.

510
00:34:11,047 --> 00:34:13,642
When the rest of the guards come,
send them after me.

511
00:34:13,747 --> 00:34:14,642
Yes, all right.

512
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:23,363
Astrid's going to get you away.

513
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:27,136
An attempt has been made to rescue this man.
Take him out to the car.

514
00:34:28,987 --> 00:34:30,286
I'm sorry, Janos.

515
00:34:30,747 --> 00:34:31,780
Stop!

516
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:35,984
After them! Arrest that girl!

517
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:38,440
Well, we all seem to be here,

518
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:41,368
except the third member of your escape committee.

519
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:45,960
- What are you talking about?
- You were seen speaking with a girl in the park.

520
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:48,103
The one who tried to escape with Denes.

521
00:34:48,197 --> 00:34:51,147
We don't know anything about that.
We don't even know her.

522
00:34:51,317 --> 00:34:55,796
A diversion was caused.
There was no one outside the kitchen.

523
00:34:55,957 --> 00:34:57,906
Of course there was someone, and there was shooting.

524
00:34:58,077 --> 00:35:02,116
Three shots have been fired from this gun.
It's yours, isn't it?

525
00:35:02,277 --> 00:35:05,155
Pretending to save my life was ingenious,

526
00:35:05,317 --> 00:35:09,754
but ingenuity requires a constant stream of new ideas.

527
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:12,795
Yours seem to have dried up.

528
00:35:14,477 --> 00:35:19,346
I come to the Central Zone.
An attempt is made on my life.

529
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,906
Denes proves to be a traitor.

530
00:35:22,077 --> 00:35:25,149
Fedorin commits suicide because I uncover him.

531
00:35:25,317 --> 00:35:28,753
Do your job, Bruce.
You can see they're all in this.

532
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:32,147
All right. Take them away.

533
00:35:32,317 --> 00:35:34,626
Take your hands off me!

534
00:35:34,797 --> 00:35:37,231
Salamander, I think you should tell me what's going on.

535
00:35:37,397 --> 00:35:39,516
One minute I see you with this lad McCrimmon,

536
00:35:39,606 --> 00:35:41,779
- you're working together. The next minute...
- I thought he saved my life.

537
00:35:41,877 --> 00:35:45,226
No, I mean before that. In Kent's office.

538
00:35:47,877 --> 00:35:50,414
- What are you talking about?
- Well I saw you there.

539
00:35:50,537 --> 00:35:52,631
But I haven't seen Kent in months.

540
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:56,031
Yes, you were with Kent, Fariah and the youngsters.

541
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:59,812
I thought it was so curious,
I spoke to your number two, Benik, about it.

542
00:35:59,917 --> 00:36:04,229
- That's really the reason I came to this zone.
- But I tell you...

543
00:36:04,397 --> 00:36:08,072
I must get back to the research centre.
You will come with me.

544
00:36:08,237 --> 00:36:10,228
It was you!

545
00:36:11,677 --> 00:36:15,465
Or someone... like you?

546
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:23,235
Patience, Mister Kent, patience.

547
00:36:23,336 --> 00:36:24,999
Astrid should have been in contact by now.

548
00:36:25,503 --> 00:36:26,505
Can't you contact her?

549
00:36:26,646 --> 00:36:28,516
If I knew where she was.

550
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:31,316
Oh no, I know she's in the Central European Zone,

551
00:36:31,446 --> 00:36:33,816
But that's a big place.
No, we'll just have to sweat it out and wait.

552
00:36:38,075 --> 00:36:41,902
Astrid, you're back. Switch to scramble.

553
00:36:42,057 --> 00:36:43,835
Scramble? Are we being monitored?

554
00:36:44,063 --> 00:36:46,328
- It's possible.  - Right. Switching now.

555
00:36:53,893 --> 00:36:54,807
Denes dead?

556
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:56,081
Yes, shot in the back.

557
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:59,445
Well, it looks as if our friend Salamander's
had a field day, doesn't it?

558
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,085
I'm afraid I haven't done very well.

559
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:05,032
Don't worry. It's not your fault.
Look, stay put and we'll join you.

560
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:09,695
The girl Astrid Ferrier,
she was in the Central European Zone.

561
00:37:09,872 --> 00:37:12,888
Was she? Well she's here now. Have you found her?

562
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:16,009
I think so. One of my men saw someone
answering her description...

563
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:17,609
...going into Giles Kent's office earlier.

564
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:18,583
Was she alone?

565
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,106
Yes, sir. But shortly after someone else followed her in.

566
00:37:21,693 --> 00:37:22,937
Well who, man, who?

567
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:25,513
Leader Salamander's food taster sir, Fariah.

568
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:28,306
Fariah?

569
00:37:28,894 --> 00:37:31,236
But what are they going to do to Jamie and Victoria?

570
00:37:31,393 --> 00:37:32,412
I don't know.

571
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:36,749
Hold them in the Central European zone
until Salamander has time to deal with them.

572
00:37:36,913 --> 00:37:39,826
No. You're wrong. Salamander doesn't care for loose ends.

573
00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:41,376
He brought them back with him.

574
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,933
What, to his headquarters, the Research Centre?

575
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:46,478
Yes. He's going to try to get information from them.

576
00:37:46,944 --> 00:37:48,585
How far will he go to get it?

577
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:50,066
Very far.

578
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:52,000
Oh, that's very comforting.

579
00:37:52,222 --> 00:37:54,412
I tell you I know Salamander.

580
00:37:54,678 --> 00:37:57,966
Yes, I... I'm not quite clear
about your part in all this.

581
00:37:58,078 --> 00:38:01,666
You work for Salamander, suddenly
you fall over yourselves to betray him.

582
00:38:02,139 --> 00:38:03,829
I came here for that purpose, yes.

583
00:38:04,002 --> 00:38:04,833
Why?

584
00:38:05,596 --> 00:38:08,568
Because I have every reason to hate Salamander.

585
00:38:08,696 --> 00:38:11,958
He blackmailed me into being his personal servant.

586
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:14,268
I even had to smile when he told me to.

587
00:38:14,477 --> 00:38:16,085
What sort of blackmail? What had you done?

588
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:18,955
- Does it really matter?
- Oh, no no no.

589
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:22,056
Of course not my dear.
Well nobody's perfect, Kent.

590
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:24,706
But I... I still can't help wondering why...

591
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,771
...why I hadn't tried to expose Salamander?

592
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:28,954
Well you were in a unique position to do so.

593
00:38:29,032 --> 00:38:31,458
Because without any proof
I'd be wasting my time.

594
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,560
Proof! Proof! Proof!
It always comes back to the same thing.

595
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,060
No one has any evidence against Salamander!

596
00:38:38,137 --> 00:38:38,918
We have some.

597
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:42,188
Not enough! It's not enough!
Salamander covers up too well.

598
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:43,399
I have what you want.

599
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:44,561
But I thought that you said...

600
00:38:44,695 --> 00:38:46,506
No. Not about me. Fedorin.

601
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:50,879
Fedorin? A public embezzler
who commits suicide?

602
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:54,929
Salamander engineered nearly every one
of those swindles, and I can prove it.

603
00:38:55,026 --> 00:38:55,673
How?

604
00:38:58,253 --> 00:38:59,483
Fedorin's file.

605
00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:01,334
Is the building surrounded?

606
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:02,722
A three's in position, Captain.

607
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:03,830
Just closing up the gaps.

608
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,299
Well you haven't brought me here
on a fool's errand, I hope?

609
00:39:07,374 --> 00:39:12,352
But I'm afraid this... this still isn't evidence,
it's... it's not real evidence.

610
00:39:12,445 --> 00:39:15,337
You mean even this doesn't convince you about Salamander?

611
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,996
Oh, I'm not saying that.

612
00:39:17,213 --> 00:39:19,695
Well then you'll do it? You'll impersonate him?

613
00:39:19,844 --> 00:39:22,870
And of course when they see you with me
they're bound to think you're Salamander.

614
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:27,009
But I... I still don't know if I can carry it off.

615
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:28,911
It's the only way to get your friends released.

616
00:39:29,084 --> 00:39:30,364
Yesss...

617
00:39:30,808 --> 00:39:32,015
Of course, there are...

618
00:39:32,145 --> 00:39:36,070
Oh I see, yes of course, there are conditions, aren't there?

619
00:39:36,175 --> 00:39:38,620
You help me, I defeat Salamander?

620
00:39:38,722 --> 00:39:42,579
Now look, you're giving me the biggest opportunity
I'll ever have of ridding the world of this monster.

621
00:39:42,692 --> 00:39:45,579
Either I can convince you one way,
or I'll have to do it another.

622
00:39:45,697 --> 00:39:48,661
What you really want me to do is to kill him, isn't it?

623
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:50,994
What else do you do when someone is evil?

624
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:54,065
Private justice, eh? Oh no, no.

625
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:57,165
I'll expose him, ruin him, have him arrested,

626
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:59,605
But I won't be his executioner.
No one has that right.

627
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,951
Sometimes it's necessary.

628
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:02,660
- No.  - Yes, Doctor yes!

629
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:05,858
Right, we'll move in.

630
00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:08,060
Either you get rid of Salamander,

631
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:10,360
or we won't lift a finger to help your friends.

632
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:13,132
Mister Kent, look.

633
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:17,569
I'd make up my mind quickly if I were you.

634
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:19,559
- Why?  - Have a look out of the window.

635
00:40:19,786 --> 00:40:20,567
Well, what is it?

636
00:40:25,785 --> 00:40:27,571
What do we do now?

637
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:28,939
Over here, quick!

638
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:30,004
Well what's that?

639
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:32,086
- Through here, the ventilator shaft.
- The files.

640
00:40:32,235 --> 00:40:33,752
- Come on, quick.  - But where did it go?

641
00:40:34,143 --> 00:40:35,481
It doesn't matter, come on.

642
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,472
It's locked.

643
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:38,608
Now you, Doctor, next.

644
00:40:38,731 --> 00:40:40,019
- Oh what about you?
- Kent! Open the door

645
00:40:40,156 --> 00:40:41,807
Oh no, you're too important.
You go, and Giles.

646
00:40:42,037 --> 00:40:42,671
- I'll follow  - All right.

647
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:43,297
Very well...

648
00:40:43,395 --> 00:40:45,776
...you leave me no alternative. Break it down.

649
00:40:49,106 --> 00:40:49,799
Get back!

650
00:40:49,888 --> 00:40:50,960
Get away from that door!

651
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:01,667
Did you get the others?

652
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:03,126
Not yet, sir.

653
00:41:03,705 --> 00:41:10,403
Now listen to me. It was you,
Astrid Ferrier, Giles Kent...

654
00:41:10,505 --> 00:41:13,523
...and another. Who was the other man?

655
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:19,958
You'll know soon... soon enough.

656
00:41:20,276 --> 00:41:22,382
I want to know now.

657
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:24,347
Sir...

658
00:41:24,486 --> 00:41:27,425
Shut up! Well?

659
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:34,550
You can't threaten me now, Benik.

660
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:40,550
I can only die once,
and someone's beaten you to it.

661
00:41:41,393 --> 00:41:43,609
Who was the other man?

662
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:47,947
Sir?

663
00:41:49,152 --> 00:41:50,583
She's dead.

664
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:52,778
Good.

665
00:41:59,013 --> 00:42:03,369
Fedorin's file. Thank you.

666
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:10,557
What you mean is you failed.

667
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,455
I always said something should be done about Kent.

668
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:16,299
You always say. You say things, but you don't think.

669
00:42:16,463 --> 00:42:19,413
You exceeded your authority, Benik.
A woman's been killed.

670
00:42:19,563 --> 00:42:20,185
Resisting arrest.

671
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:23,411
Maybe. But you can't just take the law into your own hands.

672
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:25,411
Giles Kent hadn't broken any rules that I know of.

673
00:42:25,602 --> 00:42:29,131
For sure he'd show himself one day,
he was simply building up his resistance group.

674
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:35,114
Resistance group! The man's a traitor.
These people are rebels.

675
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:41,611
Bruce, you must find this man who impersonated me.
The dangers are obvious.

676
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:45,254
He could walk in anywhere at any time
pretending to be me and ruin everything.

677
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:46,113
You can leave that to me.

678
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:47,071
How so?

679
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:51,272
Benik, come with me and I'll go over
the security arrangements with you now.

680
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:55,213
Do as you're told!

681
00:42:57,084 --> 00:42:59,521
I think you'll find this interesting.

682
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:06,693
What? The girl Fariah had this?

683
00:43:10,034 --> 00:43:11,693
What can I say?

684
00:43:23,024 --> 00:43:23,981
Yes sir?

685
00:43:24,317 --> 00:43:28,490
The records room is out of bounds.
I am not to be disturbed.

686
00:43:28,617 --> 00:43:30,390
See that the security locks are engaged.

687
00:43:30,513 --> 00:43:32,502
Very well, sir. For how long, sir?

688
00:43:32,606 --> 00:43:33,972
For as long as I say so.

689
00:43:34,082 --> 00:43:34,796
Yes sir.

690
00:45:24,029 --> 00:45:27,385
It seems that Salamander's
locked himself away and can't be got at.

691
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:28,262
So?

692
00:45:28,406 --> 00:45:30,200
Well, suppose the place caught fire?

693
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:31,220
It won't.

694
00:45:31,366 --> 00:45:32,193
Don't be foolish!

695
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:35,498
Look, I can only tell you that
when Salamander works in records,

696
00:45:35,591 --> 00:45:38,598
as he does from time to time, no one is allowed in.

697
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:43,092
I can understand if it were a... laboratory...

698
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:45,292
or... a... research room of some sort, but a...

699
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:49,592
a records room? What sort of records
have you got in there anyway?

700
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:50,499
What did you want to see him about?

701
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:53,017
Never mind. I just don't like mysteries.

702
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:56,217
Salamander's far too important
to lock himself away like this,

703
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:59,317
anything might happen, a world emergency.

704
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:04,017
Suppose I had to order you to let me in there?

705
00:46:04,213 --> 00:46:09,260
It wouldn't do any good. When the locks are switched over
they can only be opened from the inside.

706
00:46:57,872 --> 00:47:03,963
I have returned.
Take radiation precautions.

707
00:47:04,172 --> 00:47:07,963
I will make a report about the surface.

708
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,670
He's back!

709
00:47:09,867 --> 00:47:11,498
He's managed to get back again.

710
00:47:11,616 --> 00:47:13,280
Let's hope he's got some good news this time.

711
00:47:13,379 --> 00:47:15,240
Do you think Salamander's found some more food, Swann?

712
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:19,057
I hope so, otherwise we're finished.
Where's that stock list?

713
00:47:23,659 --> 00:47:26,504
Welcome back, Salamander. Are you all right?

714
00:47:26,582 --> 00:47:31,827
Don't, don't come too near my friend,
I am not yet decontaminated.

715
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,827
I am too weary, totally weary.

716
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:37,834
You shouldn't have made this trip,
Salamander, you're doing too much.

717
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:41,465
Someone has to bring back the food
for you, my friend, huh?

718
00:47:43,115 --> 00:47:47,865
You know that the radiation
is slowly killing me, don't you Swann?

719
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,417
You're just doing too much.

720
00:47:49,557 --> 00:47:51,628
I worry about you all the time.

721
00:47:53,057 --> 00:47:56,228
What're you going to do when I am no longer here?

722
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:04,087
Radiation gets a little more each time, hm?

723
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,887
One day, that needle will stay at maximum radiation.

724
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:13,846
- Don't say that.  - Why... Mary. Colin.

725
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,084
Huh, it's my big joke, huh?

726
00:48:15,317 --> 00:48:17,004
Just to frighten you a little.

727
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:18,904
I've got good news for us!

728
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:19,927
We can return to the surface?

729
00:48:20,036 --> 00:48:23,694
No no no not yet, but I've found another store of food...

730
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:24,897
Thank goodness!

731
00:48:25,023 --> 00:48:28,643
...And it is undamaged.
Colin, open the last store of wine, huh?

732
00:48:28,723 --> 00:48:32,643
Go on, you help him too, Mary.

733
00:48:34,707 --> 00:48:36,685
You must take it slowly for goodness sake.

734
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:41,662
I'm all right my friend. I'm just a little dizzy. It's...

735
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:48,662
It's terrible up there, you know,
Swann, you've no idea.

736
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,462
Right, I am ready.

737
00:48:57,506 --> 00:48:59,914
But I still don't understand what's happened to Fariah.

738
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:01,827
She went the wrong way. We lost her.

739
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:03,956
Well we must find her!
You don't seem to realize how vital it is.

740
00:49:04,092 --> 00:49:05,887
Doctor, hold still a moment will you?

741
00:49:06,001 --> 00:49:06,800
Sorry.

742
00:49:08,037 --> 00:49:12,588
There. Look at that, Giles, isn't it amazing?

743
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:13,992
Salamander to the life.

744
00:49:14,405 --> 00:49:17,029
Yes, it's... it's not bad.

745
00:49:17,213 --> 00:49:18,219
Shh, I think I heard something.

746
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:19,780
Perhaps it's Fariah.

747
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:27,589
Stay where you are. I've been looking forward
to meeting you again.

748
00:49:27,813 --> 00:49:31,455
Over there... No, not you.

749
00:49:33,913 --> 00:49:36,855
Sit down, all of you.

750
00:49:37,154 --> 00:49:39,873
Incredible. You fooled me the first time we met,

751
00:49:39,994 --> 00:49:44,223
but now, even Salamander himself
would think he was looking in a mirror.

752
00:49:44,254 --> 00:49:49,123
Why? You want this man to impersonate Salamander, why?

753
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:52,423
How much are they paying you?

754
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:53,503
I beg your pardon?

755
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:56,220
They want you to assassinate Salamander,
don't they? Take his place?

756
00:49:57,072 --> 00:49:58,820
That's ridiculous! I couldn't possibly do that.

757
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,179
But you were preparing to impersonate him, weren't you?

758
00:50:01,392 --> 00:50:02,178
Well well, yes.

759
00:50:02,326 --> 00:50:03,946
Alright then, why?

760
00:50:04,122 --> 00:50:08,704
Because Salamander holds my two friends prisoner
and I was going to attempt to rescue them.

761
00:50:08,966 --> 00:50:13,861
And at the same time get evidence
that would expose Salamander...

762
00:50:13,966 --> 00:50:17,461
...as a traitor, blackmailer and murderer!

763
00:50:17,657 --> 00:50:20,306
Quite an ambitious plan.
How do you know such evidence exists?

764
00:50:20,478 --> 00:50:21,719
It exists in Salamander's records.

765
00:50:21,908 --> 00:50:24,365
Oh, yes, I know why you want Salamander out of the way.

766
00:50:24,478 --> 00:50:30,365
You hate him because he exposed
your profitable sideline of misusing public money.

767
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,958
Oh, it was Salamander who was misusing the money.

768
00:50:33,107 --> 00:50:36,334
And I was dismissed from my post and
the evidence against Salamander concealed.

769
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,129
So you say. But you've no evidence at all
against Salamander, have you?

770
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,485
I tell you the evidence is in Salamander's records.

771
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:44,462
And I'm expected to take that from you?

772
00:50:44,578 --> 00:50:46,935
We do hold evidence...

773
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:50,306
that Salamander isn't quite
so pure and white as he's painted.

774
00:50:50,498 --> 00:50:51,839
No? What?

775
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:55,599
A file, containing certain information
about a gentleman called Fedorin.

776
00:50:56,164 --> 00:51:00,085
Salamander was going to
use this evidence against Fedorin.

777
00:51:00,164 --> 00:51:04,585
Blackmail him into submission.
after he'd got rid of Denes, that is.

778
00:51:04,826 --> 00:51:06,768
And so gain control of another zone.

779
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,148
Where is this file?

780
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:10,851
Fariah has it, Salamander's food taster.

781
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:14,340
Fariah? But she's dead.

782
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:17,715
Dead? But how?

783
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:20,111
She was shot by one of Benik's guards, escaping arrest.

784
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:24,513
Escaping arrest? Benik had her killed,

785
00:51:24,616 --> 00:51:26,613
because she had evidence against Salamander.

786
00:51:26,723 --> 00:51:29,398
And Benik will return the file to Salamander.

787
00:51:29,493 --> 00:51:31,198
We must get to the Research Station.

788
00:51:31,285 --> 00:51:32,534
You're not going anywhere or doing anything.

789
00:51:32,685 --> 00:51:35,634
As far as I'm concerned, this story you've told me
could be a pack of lies...

790
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:38,334
to cover your attempt to assassinate Salamander.

791
00:51:38,485 --> 00:51:43,334
Now I'm not saying I'm altogether satisfied with
Salamander or his organisation,

792
00:51:43,455 --> 00:51:45,634
but I'll investigate in my own way.

793
00:51:45,889 --> 00:51:49,059
Meanwhile Salamander will have found a way to cover himself,

794
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,699
and also a way of disposing of you.
You're digging your own grave, Bruce.

795
00:51:52,907 --> 00:51:55,964
That's my affair. And I do things my own way.

796
00:51:56,982 --> 00:51:59,594
And I do things my way.

797
00:52:00,054 --> 00:52:04,197
Really, as Head of Security,
you should have more reliable guards.

798
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:09,350
- Leader Salamander?
- Still inside, sir.

799
00:52:09,453 --> 00:52:10,901
Let me know the moment the doors are opened.

800
00:52:11,035 --> 00:52:11,655
Yes sir.

801
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:23,841
So you've brought them?
Good. Any trouble?

802
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,865
No, a light drug saw to that.

803
00:52:26,066 --> 00:52:27,560
Let me know the moment they wake up.

804
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:28,631
Yes sir.

805
00:52:29,044 --> 00:52:33,870
I'm looking forward to questioning them.
I have the feeling they're going to be stubborn.

806
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,870
So much more interesting when our prisoners are stubborn.

807
00:52:41,706 --> 00:52:45,748
You're only making trouble for yourself.
Killing me won't get you anywhere.

808
00:52:45,837 --> 00:52:49,951
We have to get to the Research Station,
and you're not going to stop us.

809
00:52:50,055 --> 00:52:51,693
But you're completely surrounded.

810
00:52:51,805 --> 00:52:54,893
You don't really believe I came here
with just one guard, do you?

811
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,393
You'd be very silly to try and fight your way out.

812
00:52:58,505 --> 00:53:02,253
I'd give you about... thirty seconds to live if you try.

813
00:53:02,356 --> 00:53:04,338
Alright Bruce, we might have just thirty seconds

814
00:53:04,406 --> 00:53:06,338
but you'd have exactly half that time, if you were lucky!

815
00:53:06,534 --> 00:53:09,261
Please, Mister Kent!
You're forgetting one very important thing.

816
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,516
- What?  - Me.

817
00:53:10,696 --> 00:53:13,956
Without me you haven't got an earthly chance
of getting in that control centre.

818
00:53:14,047 --> 00:53:14,781
So?

819
00:53:14,889 --> 00:53:18,178
I told you before,
I will not have anything to do with violence!

820
00:53:18,444 --> 00:53:19,537
And what about your two friends?

821
00:53:19,644 --> 00:53:21,737
Are you going to leave them
to the tender mercies of Salamander?

822
00:53:21,843 --> 00:53:25,224
No I am not. May I?

823
00:53:25,412 --> 00:53:28,292
- What?  - Please? Just trust me.

824
00:53:28,769 --> 00:53:34,088
Now then, I think you agree that
at this moment your life is in my hands.

825
00:53:37,961 --> 00:53:38,954
What are you doing?

826
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:39,941
Hold it.

827
00:53:40,127 --> 00:53:43,056
It's alright, Mister Bruce isn't going
to shoot anyone, are you?

828
00:53:43,283 --> 00:53:46,068
Why? Why'd you do that?

829
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:49,810
Because I think I know what sort of man you are
- honest and reasonable.

830
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:51,376
Go on.

831
00:53:51,682 --> 00:53:55,817
I gave you back that gun because I trust you.
Now I want you to trust me.

832
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:59,416
You must be a complete fool, or very clever.

833
00:53:59,685 --> 00:54:03,136
Well I'm afraid you will have to
make up your mind to that right away.

834
00:54:03,348 --> 00:54:05,686
What do you hope to gain from this gesture?

835
00:54:05,979 --> 00:54:07,236
Your confidence.

836
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,962
Do you believe Kent's accusations against Salamander?

837
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:15,339
I think there's reasonable doubt about
Salamander's personal integrity,

838
00:54:15,439 --> 00:54:16,339
but there's only one way to get proof.

839
00:54:16,433 --> 00:54:18,427
By getting into Salamander's Research Station?

840
00:54:18,681 --> 00:54:22,035
Yes. And my two young friends may have some information.

841
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,691
And if there isn't any evidence?

842
00:54:24,952 --> 00:54:28,950
Then you'll be perfectly free to arrest us
and put us in prison, won't you?

843
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:33,249
Alright, I'll do it, on one condition.

844
00:54:33,695 --> 00:54:34,401
And what's that?

845
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:36,961
That you and I go alone,
Kent and the girl stay here as hostages.

846
00:54:37,134 --> 00:54:38,290
No wait a minute, I must go with him.

847
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:43,609
No, Kent, you stay here.
I must be mad to trust you.

848
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,609
I only hope your impersonation of Salamander fools Benik.

849
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:49,009
If it doesn't, we're in dead trouble.

850
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:53,709
Here, take this. Keep those two in the caravan.

851
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:58,709
Oh, and, um, watch the girl. Come on.

852
00:55:06,314 --> 00:55:12,820
Ah, how we getting on here, huh?
Ah, all this? That's a good haul.

853
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:16,684
Stand by to make your report, Swann.

854
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:32,016
Reaching full power here, Swann.

855
00:55:43,525 --> 00:55:45,364
Salamander, I must see you.

856
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:48,165
Not now, we are too busy.

857
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:49,321
This is urgent.

858
00:55:52,009 --> 00:55:53,196
Oh very well.

859
00:56:01,702 --> 00:56:02,894
Now what's the matter, huh?

860
00:56:02,994 --> 00:56:04,366
What's this? What is this?

861
00:56:04,596 --> 00:56:05,255
What?

862
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:07,151
Newspaper. It's a piece of newspaper.

863
00:56:08,766 --> 00:56:09,743
So?

864
00:56:09,943 --> 00:56:13,995
Well go on, look at it. Read it. Last year's date.

865
00:56:14,143 --> 00:56:15,995
Look at the bit of headline there. THERE!

866
00:56:16,076 --> 00:56:17,661
Control yourself, Swann. You'll go mad.

867
00:56:17,724 --> 00:56:20,521
"Holiday Liner Sinks"!

868
00:56:20,724 --> 00:56:24,021
You say there's a global war. Radiation everywhere.

869
00:56:24,124 --> 00:56:28,421
How can there be holiday liners? Tell me how!

870
00:56:28,624 --> 00:56:33,421
You've lied to us, haven't you? HAVEN'T YOU?

871
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:45,737
In a way, Swann, yes. I had to.

872
00:56:45,868 --> 00:56:47,764
Had to? What do you mean had to?

873
00:56:48,007 --> 00:56:50,635
Well it's true that... that the war is over,

874
00:56:50,737 --> 00:56:58,035
but have you any idea what happens to people
who've been involved in a nuclear war? HAVE YOU?

875
00:56:58,134 --> 00:56:59,467
Course I haven't, I've been down here.

876
00:56:59,772 --> 00:57:05,710
Those who are lucky enough to escape the annihilation
have their bodies eaten away by radiation poisoning.

877
00:57:05,802 --> 00:57:08,310
They're deformed in mind and body.

878
00:57:08,552 --> 00:57:10,025
But this, this, this newspaper?

879
00:57:10,205 --> 00:57:13,574
They have a kind of society,
but it's... it's evil! Corrupt!

880
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:16,474
You don't think I could expose you to that sort of thing?

881
00:57:16,556 --> 00:57:18,674
Think of Mary and the other women.

882
00:57:18,762 --> 00:57:20,474
You could have told me, at least.

883
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:21,704
I decided not to.

884
00:57:21,904 --> 00:57:23,120
You should have told me.

885
00:57:23,303 --> 00:57:25,618
I thought it was best.

886
00:57:26,023 --> 00:57:30,018
And what about the natural disasters
we've been organising?

887
00:57:30,123 --> 00:57:32,456
The volcanoes, earthquakes?

888
00:57:33,118 --> 00:57:37,117
Swann, they're not fit to live.

889
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:40,148
You're murdering them, killing them off!

890
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:43,330
I want you and the others
to inherit the Earth, make a new world.

891
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:47,681
Yes, I know all about that,
but not at the price of wholesale murder!

892
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:53,209
It's not murder! If you could see
you would understand. It's an act of mercy.

893
00:57:53,316 --> 00:57:54,779
There must be some other way.

894
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:55,960
NO!

895
00:57:56,676 --> 00:58:04,364
I won't take your word any more.
I want to see for myself.

896
00:58:05,801 --> 00:58:08,698
You, you, you'd be horrified.

897
00:58:08,778 --> 00:58:09,563
Maybe.

898
00:58:09,931 --> 00:58:11,432
The radiation would kill you!

899
00:58:11,576 --> 00:58:13,015
I'll chance that.

900
00:58:15,899 --> 00:58:21,764
Very well. But, but promise me one thing,
you won't tell the others.

901
00:58:22,274 --> 00:58:23,008
Why shouldn't I?

902
00:58:23,177 --> 00:58:25,860
Because I am right and you are wrong!

903
00:58:25,977 --> 00:58:31,260
You, you wouldn't want to,
you wouldn't want to hurt them like that, huh?

904
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,523
And if you're lying,
and I want to tell when I get back...?

905
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:38,056
How can I stop you?

906
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:43,968
You'd better, ah, tell them you're coming with me.

907
00:58:45,483 --> 00:58:48,268
Say er, say you've persuaded me.

908
00:58:50,683 --> 00:58:54,768
Swann, trust me, don't go ahead with this huh?

909
00:58:55,297 --> 00:58:56,334
I have to.

910
00:58:58,312 --> 00:58:59,654
Where are we?

911
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:05,497
You're in the Australasian zone.
I had you brought here especially.

912
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,403
Why?

913
00:59:06,545 --> 00:59:08,920
So that Salamander could ask you some questions.

914
00:59:09,209 --> 00:59:12,766
For all the answers he's gonna get
he might as well have left us there.

915
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:13,574
Stand up when you talk to me!

916
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:15,291
You'll get nowhere by shouting.

917
00:59:15,461 --> 00:59:19,950
On the contrary. I'm going to get everything
I want from you two.

918
00:59:20,334 --> 00:59:22,035
We'll not tell you a thing.

919
00:59:24,245 --> 00:59:26,769
That's good. I like that.

920
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:30,899
- What?  - Spirit. Resistance.

921
00:59:30,972 --> 00:59:34,919
You've got plenty of both, haven't you, boy?

922
00:59:35,056 --> 00:59:39,095
Well I wonder how long you'll last.
Five minutes?

923
00:59:39,192 --> 00:59:43,519
No, a little longer, maybe? Ten, perhaps?

924
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,112
- What do you mean?
- Come now, you don't think...

925
00:59:46,273 --> 00:59:49,118
...I'm just going to sit here
and ask questions, do you?

926
00:59:49,379 --> 00:59:51,742
You must have been a nasty little boy.

927
00:59:51,843 --> 00:59:55,728
Oh I was. But I had a very enjoyable childhood.

928
00:59:58,844 --> 01:00:07,315
Ha ha hah. Yes, I thought so.
Spirit, plenty of spirit.

929
01:00:09,044 --> 01:00:15,015
Oh, we're going to enjoy ourselves, aren't we? Now then...

930
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:18,461
I... I thought you were going to take us to see Salamander?

931
01:00:18,643 --> 01:00:22,948
Yes I will. But he'd expect me to do my little best first.

932
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:25,665
You lay a finger on her, I'll kill you.

933
01:00:26,029 --> 01:00:29,732
Will you? How? Ha ha ha.

934
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:35,332
No. I think the time's come for you
to answer my questions, don't you?

935
01:00:36,529 --> 01:00:37,987
Come here, girl!

936
01:00:40,129 --> 01:00:42,332
If you don't, I shall have to shoot one of you.

937
01:00:43,429 --> 01:00:47,932
Oh, not a mortal wound. In the leg, perhaps?

938
01:00:50,456 --> 01:00:51,768
Better go. Don't worry.

939
01:00:52,961 --> 01:00:56,886
There. That's better.

940
01:00:57,234 --> 01:01:01,686
Oh, such pretty hair, don't you think?

941
01:01:01,964 --> 01:01:04,505
Alright, leave her alone. What do want to know?

942
01:01:04,674 --> 01:01:10,082
Quite a lot. And you're going to
tell me everything. Aren't you?

943
01:01:10,272 --> 01:01:11,850
- Aaah!  - All right, yes!

944
01:01:12,341 --> 01:01:14,584
Who's behind you? Is it Giles Kent?

945
01:01:17,547 --> 01:01:19,151
Oh, so they're here, eh?

946
01:01:19,455 --> 01:01:21,129
Salamander, I, I thought you were in Records?

947
01:01:21,223 --> 01:01:22,189
Have they told you anything yet?

948
01:01:22,293 --> 01:01:23,289
Not yet.

949
01:01:23,504 --> 01:01:25,832
Very well. Bruce and I will take over.

950
01:01:25,954 --> 01:01:30,492
You may go, and er,
take your little puppy dog with you, hm?

951
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:37,335
Now...

952
01:01:37,581 --> 01:01:39,067
We can't tell you anything.

953
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:42,929
Of course not. We know everything.

954
01:01:44,856 --> 01:01:47,429
We know about Giles Kent,

955
01:01:47,655 --> 01:01:49,929
we know about the girl called Astrid,

956
01:01:50,087 --> 01:01:52,529
and we know about your friend the Doctor.

957
01:01:54,438 --> 01:01:55,855
I don't believe you.

958
01:01:56,074 --> 01:01:59,177
A childish plan to impersonate me.
Yes the truth, isn't it?

959
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:00,575
Ah but he didn't agree to it.

960
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:04,599
But you two were sent to
the Central European zone to stir up trouble.

961
01:02:04,822 --> 01:02:05,912
If you want to know the truth,

962
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:08,412
Giles Kent told us a story and we weren't sure.

963
01:02:08,522 --> 01:02:10,012
Before the Doctor could do anything

964
01:02:10,106 --> 01:02:13,212
we had to come here
and find out what person you were like.

965
01:02:13,407 --> 01:02:14,742
Yeah, and we found that out right enough.

966
01:02:15,109 --> 01:02:19,468
You see Bruce, they just terrorists.
Not very big fry, either.

967
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:23,868
All this nonsense about proof against me.

968
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:27,391
If you're doing so much good for the world,
why are you so afraid for your own life?

969
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,649
Aye, and why do you have so many enemies?

970
01:02:28,717 --> 01:02:30,895
- Personal guards?
- Your own food taster?

971
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:34,121
And why destroy the one man
people trusted, Alexander Denes?

972
01:02:34,295 --> 01:02:35,890
- Aye.  - What do you mean, destroy?

973
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:36,846
One of your men shot him.

974
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:37,888
Trying to escape?

975
01:02:38,033 --> 01:02:38,900
He shot him deliberately.

976
01:02:39,041 --> 01:02:41,658
Aye. And that girl Fariah,
well she was close to Salamander,

977
01:02:41,741 --> 01:02:43,658
she'd speak against him, I know she would.

978
01:02:43,701 --> 01:02:44,744
Fariah is dead.

979
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:45,644
Dead?

980
01:02:45,783 --> 01:02:47,385
You've had her murdered too, have you?

981
01:02:47,536 --> 01:02:50,307
- Why you...
- Oh, Victoria! Don't hit me!

982
01:02:50,654 --> 01:02:53,340
You wouldn't hit your old friend the Doctor, would you?

983
01:02:54,054 --> 01:02:57,640
I wouldn't leave you in the tender mercy of Salamander.

984
01:02:58,086 --> 01:02:59,439
You're the Doctor?

985
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:02,864
You don't believe me? Oh. Huh.

986
01:03:13,642 --> 01:03:15,571
Only, you made me leave it in the TARDIS.

987
01:03:15,657 --> 01:03:17,332
- It is him!  - Oh, Doctor!

988
01:03:17,468 --> 01:03:19,986
"Tardis"? "Tardis", what's that?

989
01:03:20,181 --> 01:03:22,854
Well, it's a little place that we three have in common.

990
01:03:23,181 --> 01:03:26,454
You must admit they thought
I was Salamander to begin with.

991
01:03:26,563 --> 01:03:31,022
Yes. I concede that. But there's still no proof.

992
01:03:31,272 --> 01:03:33,808
No, but there's enough doubt in your mind...

993
01:03:33,902 --> 01:03:38,008
to make you go on asking questions, isn't there?
That's why we came here.

994
01:03:40,915 --> 01:03:44,021
Wait. What happens up there?

995
01:03:44,365 --> 01:03:48,513
Oh, it ends in a ruined building.
This is where I bring the stores,

996
01:03:48,615 --> 01:03:51,217
- uh, you would be safer here.
- Safer?

997
01:03:51,435 --> 01:03:54,753
Yes, the radiation.
I don't think it filters down here.

998
01:03:58,478 --> 01:04:00,214
I still want to see the surface.

999
01:04:00,617 --> 01:04:01,869
You will, you will.

1000
01:04:04,786 --> 01:04:07,760
I should have insisted on going with him.
Bruce should have taken me.

1001
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:09,854
You know he doesn't trust you.

1002
01:04:10,087 --> 01:04:11,823
He wouldn't trust his own grandmother.

1003
01:04:12,084 --> 01:04:13,846
Oh, never mind, Giles. We've come a long way.

1004
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:18,846
Months ago, well a few weeks ago even,
nobody would have even listened to you.

1005
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:19,718
Oh, maybe.

1006
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:21,877
There's no maybe about it.

1007
01:04:22,463 --> 01:04:26,555
Yeah perhaps you're right.
Bruce listens to us at last.

1008
01:04:26,663 --> 01:04:28,755
He's even prepared to ask questions, that's fine, but...

1009
01:04:28,863 --> 01:04:31,955
I know Salamander.
He'd talk his way out of the quicksand.

1010
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:34,785
Well what else can we do,
the guard's still outside?

1011
01:04:38,023 --> 01:04:39,651
I must get into the Research Centre.

1012
01:04:39,823 --> 01:04:43,421
I've got to make sure that Bruce
understands the evidence, understands it, Astrid.

1013
01:04:43,523 --> 01:04:46,621
Don't you realize, he mightn't know
what he's looking for. I know.

1014
01:04:46,871 --> 01:04:50,104
But we can't attack the guard.
It would only make matters worse.

1015
01:04:50,378 --> 01:04:52,417
Not if I was to give Bruce real evidence.

1016
01:04:53,496 --> 01:04:57,158
Giles, how long would it take you
to get to the Research Station?

1017
01:04:57,362 --> 01:05:00,238
Well just a few minutes, I've got a pass.
It's just a matter of getting there.

1018
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:03,998
Alright, I think I can help you.

1019
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:06,718
I'll draw the guard off and leave you alone.

1020
01:05:08,831 --> 01:05:10,263
You think you can do it?

1021
01:05:10,662 --> 01:05:11,847
Yes, I think so.

1022
01:05:12,137 --> 01:05:14,597
But I thought you said we weren't going to attack the guard?

1023
01:05:14,825 --> 01:05:16,955
Oh, we're not going to attack the guard,

1024
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:20,995
but there is going to be an attack. A fatal one.

1025
01:05:32,885 --> 01:05:34,308
Where does this lead?

1026
01:05:34,507 --> 01:05:36,531
It goes on up and comes out in a field.

1027
01:05:41,211 --> 01:05:42,292
What about radiation?

1028
01:05:42,476 --> 01:05:43,722
Here it's almost negligible.

1029
01:05:43,892 --> 01:05:46,427
You mean you could have brought others here from below?

1030
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:50,890
I don't understand you.

1031
01:05:51,042 --> 01:05:53,327
Don't you realise what a break
it would be for them,

1032
01:05:53,402 --> 01:05:56,027
just moving away from that underground tomb once in a while?

1033
01:05:56,129 --> 01:05:58,828
You seem to forget, Swann,
I've brought people up here before!

1034
01:05:58,929 --> 01:06:00,228
There's always an element of risk!

1035
01:06:00,321 --> 01:06:03,913
I still want to have a look at these people
you say are living on the surface.

1036
01:06:04,187 --> 01:06:05,403
Where does that lead?

1037
01:06:05,496 --> 01:06:08,205
Oh, that's a dead end.
It's a place I sometimes rest.

1038
01:06:08,296 --> 01:06:11,025
It's very hard work, you know, bringing all the...

1039
01:06:11,213 --> 01:06:13,831
Yes, I know that.
This way, then?

1040
01:06:13,995 --> 01:06:17,769
You, you sure you... won't change your mind, huh?

1041
01:06:28,094 --> 01:06:29,223
What's going on here?

1042
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,307
He's been shot. Through the window.

1043
01:06:32,675 --> 01:06:34,538
Alright, stand back.

1044
01:06:36,223 --> 01:06:38,056
He's finished.

1045
01:06:38,675 --> 01:06:40,938
Better get a doctor anyway, just in case.

1046
01:06:41,905 --> 01:06:44,177
Hey! Come back!

1047
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:08,065
Hellllp! Somebody help me.

1048
01:07:08,422 --> 01:07:12,280
Heeellllp! Help... Somebody help me...

1049
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:15,295
Who did this to you?

1050
01:07:15,682 --> 01:07:20,244
A man named... Salamander.

1051
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:22,179
Salamander?

1052
01:07:21,387 --> 01:07:24,003
He did it... down there...

1053
01:07:31,803 --> 01:07:33,653
This is Salamander.

1054
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:38,859
I want a security escort to come
to the interrogation room immediately.

1055
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:45,299
I'm releasing two prisoners.
They are to be conducted to the main gates and set free.

1056
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:49,659
Is that understood? Good.

1057
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:53,454
- Well I hope that works.
- So do I.

1058
01:07:53,513 --> 01:07:55,376
What do you want us to do when we get outside?

1059
01:07:55,532 --> 01:07:57,204
There are plenty of public phones in the area.

1060
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,904
Dial double zero one and ask for a man named Forrester.

1061
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,222
- Eh?  - He's my deputy to this area.

1062
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:04,514
Double zero one Forrester.

1063
01:08:04,667 --> 01:08:07,299
Tell him where I am and just say "redhead".

1064
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:08,137
Redhead.

1065
01:08:08,262 --> 01:08:09,277
Redhead. Is that clear?

1066
01:08:09,402 --> 01:08:11,136
Redhead? Is that your wife?

1067
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:13,295
It's our emergency call.

1068
01:08:13,442 --> 01:08:14,477
Sorry.

1069
01:08:17,048 --> 01:08:23,599
Salamander... Is the, is the pass in order?

1070
01:08:25,048 --> 01:08:28,299
Very well, you have my authority.

1071
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:30,236
What's all that about?

1072
01:08:30,758 --> 01:08:32,256
We have a visitor.

1073
01:08:44,349 --> 01:08:48,102
Giles Kent. What are you doing here?

1074
01:08:48,612 --> 01:08:50,870
Oh, I've been looking forward to this meeting.

1075
01:08:50,972 --> 01:08:53,570
You're getting careless.
You didn't double lock the doors.

1076
01:08:53,692 --> 01:08:55,950
Oh, its all right, I've done it now.

1077
01:08:56,042 --> 01:09:00,270
The only way anybody can get through there
is to blast their way through.

1078
01:09:00,435 --> 01:09:02,956
- How did you get into the Research Centre?
- Oh, you know me.

1079
01:09:03,025 --> 01:09:06,859
There isn't a pass in the world
I can't get my hands on, if I put my mind to it.

1080
01:09:06,953 --> 01:09:10,148
You won't find it so easy getting out.

1081
01:09:10,339 --> 01:09:12,085
Really? Well we'll see.

1082
01:09:12,339 --> 01:09:15,085
I'm not on my own this time.
I've got friends here with me.

1083
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:18,185
And between us we're going to fix you once and for all.

1084
01:09:18,378 --> 01:09:21,131
You always were a tiresome man, Kent.

1085
01:09:21,292 --> 01:09:23,619
I'm going to be more than tiresome this time.

1086
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,419
You know the biggest mistake you ever made...

1087
01:09:25,512 --> 01:09:27,619
was not killing me when you had the chance.

1088
01:09:28,059 --> 01:09:31,488
Oh so you going to kill me huh? How petty.

1089
01:09:31,599 --> 01:09:33,188
What good do you think that will do?

1090
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,818
Hold it! Now don't move quickly,

1091
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:39,218
my nerves are a bit shaky at the moment.

1092
01:09:39,616 --> 01:09:41,451
We must get in there somehow.

1093
01:09:41,623 --> 01:09:43,909
We can't without the emergency key,
and Salamander has it in there.

1094
01:09:44,065 --> 01:09:45,456
- We could burn our way in.  - Never.

1095
01:09:45,554 --> 01:09:48,381
- Why not?
- It's an X-structure alloy, you'd hardly scratch the surface.

1096
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:51,088
We'll have to try it. Get the gear up here. Fast!

1097
01:09:51,702 --> 01:09:54,454
Ha ha ha. Never get away with it?
Oh, that's good, coming from you.

1098
01:09:54,562 --> 01:09:56,754
Don't you realize you're dispensable,

1099
01:09:56,862 --> 01:09:59,954
and the world is going to get along fine
without you from now on.

1100
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:03,454
The only good idea you ever had in your life
was getting rid of me...

1101
01:10:03,562 --> 01:10:05,854
and you couldn't even do that properly, could you?

1102
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:08,354
Ha ha ha. And now I'm back and you're finished.

1103
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,766
Oh, what's that?

1104
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:14,104
They're breaking down the door.

1105
01:10:18,374 --> 01:10:20,446
They don't appear to be having much success.

1106
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:22,642
It's not cutting, sir.

1107
01:10:22,732 --> 01:10:23,857
Never mind, keep at it.

1108
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:25,625
You're trapped, aren't you?

1109
01:10:25,863 --> 01:10:29,660
You're a fool, Salamander.
You don't think I'd forgotten already, do you?

1110
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:31,175
What?

1111
01:10:31,819 --> 01:10:34,300
I've been with you too many times in this room in the past,

1112
01:10:34,419 --> 01:10:37,200
not to know where this leads to.

1113
01:10:38,866 --> 01:10:40,445
Your little bolt-hole.

1114
01:10:40,545 --> 01:10:43,445
Halfway down the tunnel.
A passage out to the fields...

1115
01:10:43,566 --> 01:10:46,545
and enough explosives down there
to stop you or your thugs following me.

1116
01:10:47,863 --> 01:10:52,932
Well that's very interesting Mister Kent.
Why didn't you tell me that before?

1117
01:10:54,055 --> 01:10:57,298
- Oh no, it can't be.  - Oh, I'm afraid it is.

1118
01:10:57,397 --> 01:11:00,838
Oh look. Here's another surprise for you. Look behind you.

1119
01:11:01,158 --> 01:11:02,983
Astrid, you've come just in time.

1120
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:05,842
It's too late, Giles, I know everything.

1121
01:11:06,234 --> 01:11:09,062
That's him, that's the man
who took us down there in the first place.

1122
01:11:09,238 --> 01:11:10,869
Giles Kent, we thought you were dead.

1123
01:11:10,987 --> 01:11:13,139
Now look, I've never seen these people before in my life.

1124
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:16,354
They told me everything.
You and Salamander were in it together...

1125
01:11:17,173 --> 01:11:21,874
...You built an atomic shelter,
took some people down for an endurance test.

1126
01:11:22,973 --> 01:11:24,874
The next person they saw was Salamander...

1127
01:11:25,064 --> 01:11:27,950
...who told them that an atomic war had started.

1128
01:11:28,132 --> 01:11:29,215
You see, Kent...

1129
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:32,215
Oh, be careful, Doctor. He'll kill you.

1130
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,933
You kept us down like animals.

1131
01:11:34,111 --> 01:11:35,488
Why? Why did you do it to us?

1132
01:11:35,767 --> 01:11:38,596
We had to have someone create
the natural disasters, didn't we,

1133
01:11:38,767 --> 01:11:40,096
and we fooled you all!

1134
01:11:40,278 --> 01:11:41,317
You didn't fool me, Kent...

1135
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:42,710
You didn't suspect me.

1136
01:11:42,909 --> 01:11:49,129
Any man who resorts to murder as eagerly
and as rapidly as you must be suspect.

1137
01:11:49,259 --> 01:11:53,629
You didn't just want to expose Salamander,
you wanted to kill him and take his place.

1138
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:55,612
And I will! Think you're going to stop me?
And these people?

1139
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:59,712
Now move out of the way, quick!
We'll see who'll stop me!

1140
01:11:59,984 --> 01:12:05,094
Stop him, Stop him!
He's going to try and blow the place up!

1141
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:05,842
Come on then!

1142
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:08,173
No! Don't touch that door, it's red hot.

1143
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:09,497
What do you mean?

1144
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,251
Well it's locked.
They're trying to burn through from the other side.

1145
01:12:11,374 --> 01:12:12,188
Still no good, sir.

1146
01:12:12,304 --> 01:12:13,557
Look! Salamander!

1147
01:12:14,712 --> 01:12:17,758
Yes. I wonder if he knows Kent's on his way?

1148
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,231
You always were a fool, weren't you?

1149
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:36,330
Now wait a minute.
They'll be after both of us now.

1150
01:12:36,516 --> 01:12:37,759
Oh no they won't.

1151
01:12:37,912 --> 01:12:39,278
I tell you, they know!

1152
01:12:39,859 --> 01:12:44,964
So what you want me to do, huh?
Bury our differences, hmm?

1153
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:48,664
I didn't need you once, I still don't need you.

1154
01:12:48,871 --> 01:12:50,985
Now wait a minute.
The place is mined, we know that.

1155
01:12:51,071 --> 01:12:52,485
We planned it for years, together.

1156
01:12:52,571 --> 01:12:56,185
Between us we can destroy them all, and the evidence.

1157
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:58,185
Just you and me, Salamander.

1158
01:12:58,788 --> 01:13:03,385
You and me? What use are you to me?

1159
01:13:03,788 --> 01:13:07,385
You were useful once, but now...

1160
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:09,981
No. No...

1161
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:22,306
Ha ha ha ha. You won't get away
from me, Kent. Ha ha ha ha.

1162
01:13:44,108 --> 01:13:48,806
Ha ha hah. I told you you could not escape me.

1163
01:13:54,211 --> 01:14:00,785
Well if I'm going to die, Salamander,
you'll die with me.

1164
01:14:01,903 --> 01:14:03,910
No! No!

1165
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:10,379
Aaaaaaa!

1166
01:14:19,193 --> 01:14:20,967
Come on Doctor,
we're going to get you out of here.

1167
01:14:22,549 --> 01:14:25,985
Oh, look, Salamander, Giles, they're dead.

1168
01:14:26,367 --> 01:14:27,859
We'll be dead too if we don't get out of here.

1169
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:33,603
The people...

1170
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:34,677
People. What people?

1171
01:14:34,899 --> 01:14:37,105
The people underground in the deep shelter.

1172
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:38,475
They may have been killed.

1173
01:14:38,655 --> 01:14:40,390
I promised Swann I'd get them out.

1174
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:42,225
But that's not your fault.
You couldn't have done more.

1175
01:14:42,381 --> 01:14:45,601
There's a TV monitor screen in there.
There must be a link to the deep shelter.

1176
01:14:54,942 --> 01:14:57,067
It's alright! They're alive!

1177
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,405
How are you going to get to them?

1178
01:14:58,596 --> 01:15:02,613
There's a tunnel from outside.
We can get to it outside the Research Station.

1179
01:15:02,775 --> 01:15:04,830
But that's probably been destroyed by the explosion.

1180
01:15:04,976 --> 01:15:06,867
We'll get to them somehow.

1181
01:15:07,009 --> 01:15:07,869
Lookout!

1182
01:15:10,769 --> 01:15:13,630
Get me some men. I'll lead them.

1183
01:15:13,829 --> 01:15:15,308
Alright. I'll go with you.

1184
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:17,626
Oh good then. That's splendid. I'll come too.

1185
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:21,266
Oh no Doctor. It's far too dangerous.
They might mistake you as Salamander.

1186
01:15:21,365 --> 01:15:22,979
Oh yes. Ooooh.

1187
01:15:23,096 --> 01:15:24,948
- Are you hurt?  - Oh I'm alright.

1188
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:28,998
I'll come with you as far as the gates.
Come along, we must go.

1189
01:15:38,388 --> 01:15:39,785
I thought you were never coming.

1190
01:15:43,801 --> 01:15:45,574
Hey Doctor, are you alright?

1191
01:15:56,504 --> 01:16:01,539
Oh there you are Doctor.
You do look in a state. Come and sit down.

1192
01:16:01,628 --> 01:16:04,131
I told you it wouldn't be long.
You, you worry too much.

1193
01:16:04,368 --> 01:16:05,654
We shouldn't have left him.

1194
01:16:05,732 --> 01:16:07,101
You see, after the explosion, Doctor,
we dinna know what to do.

1195
01:16:07,232 --> 01:16:10,701
You said to come back here, which we did,
but I'm sure we were followed.

1196
01:16:10,888 --> 01:16:13,497
Please, can we start straight away?

1197
01:16:20,471 --> 01:16:26,894
Me, Doctor? But you said we were never to touch the controls.

1198
01:16:27,737 --> 01:16:31,943
Quite right, Jamie. Welcome to the TARDIS.

1199
01:16:32,283 --> 01:16:36,101
Thank you. You're doing so well impersonating me, ah,

1200
01:16:36,283 --> 01:16:39,101
I thought I might return the compliment.

1201
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:41,218
And Giles Kent?

1202
01:16:41,544 --> 01:16:44,798
Unfortunately, didn't survive the explosion.

1203
01:16:44,978 --> 01:16:46,486
We're going to put you outside, Salamander,

1204
01:16:46,978 --> 01:16:49,486
no friends, no safety, nothing.

1205
01:16:49,578 --> 01:16:53,586
You'll run, but they'll catch up with you.

1206
01:16:53,669 --> 01:16:54,546
No!

1207
01:16:58,773 --> 01:17:00,656
And now I'm going to kill you.

1208
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:01,982
No you don't.

1209
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,066
Oh, Doctor!

1210
01:17:07,431 --> 01:17:11,558
Victoria! Jamie! Hold onto something!

1211
01:17:12,038 --> 01:17:14,152
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

1212
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:16,583
Jamie! Oh!

1213
01:17:17,072 --> 01:17:18,805
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
