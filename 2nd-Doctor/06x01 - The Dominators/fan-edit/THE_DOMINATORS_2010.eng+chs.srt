然后他们的舰队就会来补给能量, 登陆把它取走．有点道理

693
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:33,921
You remember how when they landed
你记得不, 他们降落时

694
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:36,475
it sucked up all the radioactive dust
from the island?
它把这个岛上的放射性尘埃全都吸走了

695
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:40,321
Yes. So you're saying
that they store radioactive particles
记得, 所以你是说他们把放射性粒子存储起来了

696
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,125
and then convert that energy into power.
然后把它们转换成动力？

697
00:36:42,207 --> 00:36:43,242
Exactly!
正是！

698
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:44,726
Well, then why are they drilling?
那, 他们为什么要钻孔呢？

699
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:46,604
Look, I'll show you.
看, 我来跟你展示一下

700
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:53,083
There are four drill holes
here, here, here and here,
有四个钻孔, 在这里、这里、这里和这里

701
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,556
and one drill hole in the centre.
还有一个钻孔在中间

702
00:36:55,647 --> 00:37:00,562
Now, then, they have rockets mounted
in each of these drill holes,
现在, 他们把火箭装到各个钻孔上

703
00:37:00,647 --> 00:37:04,720
and the centre drill hole is probably
for that atomic seed device.
而中间那个钻孔很可能就是原子播种装置

704
00:37:06,847 --> 00:37:07,882
Oh.
噢

705
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,483
Well, don't you see?
嗯, 明白了吗？

706
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:15,595
They've chosen this spot because
the crust of the planet is thin.
他们选这个地点是因为这个星球的地壳很薄

707
00:37:15,687 --> 00:37:19,802
They're going to fire the rockets through the crust
他们打算发射火箭穿透地壳

708
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:22,359
into the magma, the molten core.
进入岩浆, 进而达到地核

709
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:24,961
ZOE: Then that will almost certainly
fracture the crust of the planet.
那几乎肯定会导致这个星球的地壳裂开

710
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:26,196
Exactly.
正是

711
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,721
But that will create a volcano.
但那会导致火山啊

712
00:37:28,807 --> 00:37:31,765
And if they explode the atomic
seed device in the middle of that...
而如果他们在那里面引爆那个原子播种装置...

713
00:37:31,847 --> 00:37:33,565
Yes, that's right, Zoe.
是的, 就是这样, Zoe

714
00:37:33,647 --> 00:37:38,323
The whole planet will become one vast
molten mass of radioactive material,
整个星球都会成为一个巨大的放射性材料的熔融体

715

it's not as simple as that, is it?
噢, Jamie, 并没有那么简单的, 是吧？

718
00:37:46,887 --> 00:37:49,845
If only I could get hold of
that atomic seed device,
如果我们能拿到那个原子播种装置

719
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:51,804
I might be able to defuse it.
我还是有可能拆除它的

720
00:37:51,887 --> 00:37:55,675
Yes, then there'd only be a local
volcanic eruption on the island.
是, 那样的话就只会在这个岛上有个局部的火山爆发了

721
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,439
- Yes... - But how can we get to the device?
- 对...  - 但是我们怎样才能拿到那个装置呢？

现在, 听着！你能听我说吗？

to get that device thing.

- 真的？  - 是的, 听我说

729

down the centre hole,
你刚才说他们打算把它扔进中间的钻孔

也就是他们在这里钻的那个

through from here to the borehole
我们要做的事情, 就是挖一条隧道, 从这里到那个矿洞

是的．但还是有一个问题：我们能及时挖通隧道吗？

00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:54,645
Oh, it's quite all right, Jamie.
The planet is quite safe.
噢, 完全没事的, Jamie．这个星球非常安全

832
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:57,022
There's just going to be
a localised volcanic eruption.
只会有一场局部的火山爆发

833
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,440
It'll only affect the island.
只会影响这个小岛

834
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:02,406
Maybe so, but we happen to be on the island.
也许是, 但我们恰巧就在这个岛上

835
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:12,506
Isn't it beautiful!
是不是很漂亮？

836
00:43:12,627 --> 00:43:15,380
- Oh, my word. What a wonderful sight!
- Fantastic!
- 噢，天啊，多美的景象!  - 壮观！

837
00:43:15,547 --> 00:43:18,081
Listen, will you two stop gaping at that
and get us out of here.
嘿，你俩能不能别感慨了，带我们离开这里

838
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:19,581
Don't worry, Jamie. We're safe in the Tardis.
别担心, Jamie, 我们在 TARDIS 里面很安全

839
00:43:19,677 --> 00:43:24,620
Are you sure? Has the Tardis
ever been buried in lava before?
你确定吗？ TARDIS 被岩浆掩埋过没有？

840
00:43:24,787 --> 00:43:27,365
- No.
- How can you be so sure we're going to be all right?
- 没有  - 那你怎么能这么肯定我们会没事？

841
00:43:30,327 --> 00:43:30,987
Oh, dear.
噢, 亲爱的

842
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:33,544
- Is something wrong?
- This has happened before.
- 有什么不对劲吗？  - 这事儿以前也出现过

843
00:43:33,707 --> 00:43:36,983
The fluid links aren't able to take the load. Oh!
流体连接器不工作了．噢！

844
00:43:37,547 --> 00:43:39,456
(ZOE) Mercury vapour!
水银蒸汽！

845
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:43,297
Oh! This darn thing's stuck! Of all the stupid, idiotic!
噢！这个破玩意儿卡住了！最愚蠢、傻蛋！

846
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:47,377
- Doctor, The lava's up to the Tardis!
- (ZOE) Doctor
- 博士, 熔岩都快到 TARDIS 了!  - 博士

847
00:43:47,807 --> 00:43:52,604
If only I could unstick this stupid, idiotic...
There we are.
只要我能挪动这个愚蠢、傻蛋的...这下好了

848
00:43:52,704 --> 00:43:54,212
Have you done it? Are we on our way? 
你搞定了吗？我们上路了？

849
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:58,238
It's stopped the fluid links from vaporising.
We shan't suffocate.
流体连接器停止蒸发了。我们不会窒息了

850
00:43:58,407 --> 00:44:01,639
If we don't hurry, we'll be fried by the lava.
如果我们不快点, 就会被熔岩烧成灰了

851
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:06,676
- Isn't there any way we can get away?
- Well, there IS an emergency unit, but...
- 我们有什么可能逃脱吗？  - 唔, 是有一个紧急设备, 但是...

852
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:10,237
- I can't possibly use that.
- But this IS an emergency!
- 我不能启用那个  - 但是这就是紧急情况啊

853
00:44:10,407 --> 00:44:14,844
But it moves the Tardis out of the
time-space dimension, out of reality!
但它会把 TARDIS 移出时空维度, 推到现实之外去！

854
00:44:15,007 --> 00:44:18,317
Fine. Reality's getting too hot, anyway!
很好．反正现实已经太热了！

855
00:44:19,487 --> 00:44:21,876
Oh, all right.
噢, 好吧

856
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:26,678
Here we are.
来看看

857
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:28,838
Now, then, which end was...?
喏, 哪头是...

858
00:44:29,007 --> 00:44:30,679
Yes...
对了

859
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:34,522
I can't possibly use this.
We don't know what will happen.
我不能启用这个, 我们不知道可能发生什么!
