Is the local radiation completely absorbed?

6
00:01:07,187 --> 00:01:10,623
Yes, its energy's been transferred to our fuel reserves.

7
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:14,017
- But we need much more.
- Of course. That is why we are here.

8
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,825
With respect, Navigator Rago,

9
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:19,058
I still consider we should have continued to Epsilon 4.

10
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:22,344
I decided otherwise, Probationer Toba.

11
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:24,304
But this planet has never been fully surveyed.

12
00:01:24,387 --> 00:01:27,504
It's suitable for our purpose.
The planetary crust is thin here

13
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,465
and there's an intelligent form of life
suitable for a workforce.

14
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:34,335
But the natives may not be suitable for slave labour.
Suppose they're hostile?

15
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,703
- If necessary, we shall destroy them.
- Yes, destroy them.

16
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:42,497
But only if necessary!
Commence work on the preliminary survey.

17
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:43,757
Command accepted.

- Yes, just a little bit weary, Jamie.

23
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:08,546
It's a very exhausting business

24
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:10,822
projecting all those mental images, you know.

25
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:14,263
- You need a good rest, Doctor.
- Yes, we all do. A nice holiday.

26
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:15,939
Where did you say this place was again?

27
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:19,417
Well, the scanner screen in the Tardis
showed it as an island of some sort

28
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,225
surrounded by a sea of mist.

29
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:25,937
Yes, it's an island on Dulkis,
a perfectly splendid planet.

30
00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:27,460
I've heard that one before.

31
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,822
And there won't be any Cybermen or Daleks, will there?

32
00:02:29,907 --> 00:02:33,377
(LAUGHS) No, no, no, of course not.
There's nothing unpleasant on Dulkis.

(STUTTERING) Oh, yes, Zoe,
the Dulcians are gentle and friendly.

Aye, it sounded like it!

39
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:08,222
- Did the explosion cause this?
- Oh, no, no, no.

40
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:10,741
This was caused by an explosion some time ago, Jamie.

41
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:12,943
Looks like atomic blast damage to me.

42
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:16,622
Yes, I think you're right, Zoe.

43
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:19,460
But I don't understand it.

Mind the stuff here.

46
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:25,424
And you destroyed this travel ship?

47
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:27,099
You gave me no order to the contrary.

48
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:28,540
You are a probational navigator.

49
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:31,619
Your first task is to investigate. Second, assess.

50
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:34,141
You allowed your instinct for destruction

51
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:36,616
- to interfere with your primary tasks.
- Not accepted. I did...

52
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:40,416
How can you assess that which does not exist?

53
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:42,304
Have you completed your atomic analysis?

54
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:43,979
Analysis complete.

00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:52,336

the only trace of radiation on this planet.

58
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:56,899
Drilling sites have now been located and marked.

59
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,503
Then we will examine them.

60
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:01,977
Did you check the radiation level
before we left the Tardis?

61
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:06,185
That's just what I was thinking, Zoe.
I think I did.

62
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:09,821
- Yes, I'm sure I did.
- Hey, what are you two on about?

Well, I was just thinking.

64

This place reminds me
of the old atom test islands on Earth.

00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:16,775
Yes. Yes, I think you're right, Zoe.

66
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:19,745
- Test islands?  - For atomic weapons, Jamie.

67
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:22,625
But why on Dulkis?

68
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:25,505
They've outlawed war.
No, there must be some other explanation.

69
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:28,624
Well, I vote we go back to the Tardis
and find somewhere else.

70
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:29,901
Doctor!

- What is that?
- Just a crude, box-like structure.

73
00:04:43,427 --> 00:04:45,543
Shall I summon the Quarks to destroy it?

74
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:47,504
Why? Will it interfere with the work?

75
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,576
No, but...

76
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:51,465
Then it would be wasteful to destroy it.

There's not a trace of contamination on us.

81
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,168
Yes, so I've noticed. It's odd, isn't it?

82
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:07,135
- What's odd about it?
- Well, the whole island is radioactive.

83
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:10,653
It has been for 172 years. You must know that.

84
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:12,773
- Well, it isn't now.  - Of course it is.

85
00:05:12,857 --> 00:05:13,972
- Have you checked?  - TEEL: Well, not yet.

86
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:15,126
We've only just arrived.

87
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:17,731
But we're taking the annual readings
during the next few days.

88
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,285
Well, if I were you, I'd take them now.

89
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:22,776
Oh, my beautiful trousers.

90
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:24,736
I wasn't aware that anyone else

91
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,336
had permission to work on the island except ourselves.

92
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,328
Tell me exactly what has been happening.

93
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:32,727
But I was hoping you were going to tell us that.

94
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:34,648
This is an atom test island, isn't it?

95
00:05:34,737 --> 00:05:36,409
Oh, but of course. Everybody knows that.

96
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:37,930
Oh, well, we don't.

97
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:41,054
But atomic weapons on Dulkis?

98
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:44,209
- I thought war had been abolished here.
- It has.

99
00:05:44,297 --> 00:05:47,050
You seem to know surprisingly little
about your own planet.

100
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:50,334
Well, that's it, you see.
We've just come in the Tar...

101
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,215
Well, as Jamie was about to say,

102
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:55,731
we come from a different world, from a different time.

103
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:58,092
Not from this world? Really, that's very interesting.

104
00:05:58,177 --> 00:06:00,486
I must note that in my daily report.

105
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:01,950
Well, you don't sound very surprised.

106
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:06,010
Well, it does explain how you came to
expose yourself to the dangers on this island.

107
00:06:06,097 --> 00:06:08,327
No Dulcian would do such a foolish thing.

108
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:09,645
Well, what are you doing here, then?

109
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:12,774
We're part of Educator Balan's
expedition from the university.

110
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:17,214
But when I was here some time ago,
you were a peaceful race.

111
00:06:17,297 --> 00:06:19,492
- So you've been here before?
- Well, yes.

112
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:22,853
Ah, I must put that in my...
I'm so sorry. You were saying?

113
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:26,088
Well, what's happened to you? I thought
aggressive weapons had been abolished.

114
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:30,489
Oh, indeed they have.
The second council under Director Olvin.

115
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:32,886
He banned the manufacture of all weapons.

116
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:36,094
Then what are you doing letting off
atomic devices all over the place?

117
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:38,915
Oh! Oh, there was only one explosion.

118
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:41,615
Perhaps my pupil, Kando, should explain.

119
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:44,165
Let's see how much you remember, my dear.

120
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:46,771
- Um... Oh, yes.  - The seventh council...

121
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:49,452
The seventh council under Director Manus

122
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:53,256
initiated research which lead to
the development of atomic energy.

123
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:56,249
- The des...
- BALAN: Destructive capabilities.

124
00:06:56,337 --> 00:07:00,967
The destructive capabilities of this
were immediately apparent and...

125
00:07:01,057 --> 00:07:02,092
BALAN: This island...

126
00:07:02,177 --> 00:07:05,931
And this island was used
to test an explosive device,

127
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:08,485
the results of which can be seen today.

128
00:07:08,577 --> 00:07:12,968
Thereafter, all further research
into this type of energy was prohibited,

129
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:17,812
and the island kept as both a museum
and warning for future generations.

130
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:20,013
Oh, well, she certainly does her homework.

131
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:24,568
I see. Then this is an atomic test site?

132
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:28,696
Oh, yes. You see, students...
That was really very good, Kando.

133
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:31,655
Students are brought here
to test the radiation level

134
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:34,046
and observe the effect on the vegetation.

135
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:39,655
And of course, to see for themselves
the horrors of atomic destruction.

136
00:07:39,737 --> 00:07:43,412
- So there should be radioactivity here?
- But there isn't.

137
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:46,569
No. I wonder why?

138
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:50,295
Explain.

139
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:52,891
Part of this collection of crude weapons.

140
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:54,012
Continue.

141
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:57,453
This one operates on the early laser principle.

142
00:07:57,537 --> 00:07:59,414
Fire mechanism here.

143
00:08:03,177 --> 00:08:06,169
Self-charging power cell. Limited range.

144
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:08,646
Is this all you notice?

145
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:10,489
The other weapons are just as simple.

146
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,647
There's nothing here that could threaten us.

147
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:17,049
- These things are so old that if...
- Precisely. Old.

148
00:08:17,137 --> 00:08:20,209
At last, you casually mention a fact
of major significance.

149
00:08:20,297 --> 00:08:22,492
Has it not occurred to you,
Probationer Toba,

150
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:25,535
that other weapons
must have been developed since these?

151
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:28,336
Agreed, Navigator Rago.

152
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:32,728
DOCTOR: But why do you think
we might be responsible? Thank you.

153
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:35,411
Well, it is conceivable that your craft, the...

154
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:36,532
- Tardis.  -...Tardis,

155
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,175
could have attracted the radioactivity

156
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:40,851
in much the same way as a magnet attracts metal.

157
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,689
(CHUCKLES) Oh, it would have registered.

158
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:46,406
- Do spacecraft often land in Dulkis?
- As far as I know, you are the first.

159
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:49,216
I must say, then,
you don't seem the least bit surprised.

160
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:51,174
We are taught to accept fact,

161
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:54,852
it being foolish to contemplate fantasy
in the face of reality.

162
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:57,656
You are here. This is fact.

163
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,932
That you come from another planet I accept,

164
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:02,053
because I have no other means of proving it.

165
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:04,048
- TEEL: Not a sign of radiation.
- BALAN: There.

166
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:05,411
But look what I found.

167
00:09:05,497 --> 00:09:07,294
- Cully, what are you...
- Never mind that now.

168
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:08,651
We've got to get back to the capital.

169
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:10,967
Oh, it's impossible.
We haven't even begun our survey yet.

170
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:12,285
Well, if you don't, you'll be wiped out.

171
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:14,732
He claims to have seen robots and spacecraft.

172
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:17,490
- You didn't tell me you brought robots.
- I haven't.

173
00:09:17,577 --> 00:09:19,852
Look, I brought three people here in my ship.

174
00:09:19,937 --> 00:09:21,814
They've been killed by those creatures.
So if you don't...

175
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:22,932
(LAUGHING)

176
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:25,611
- ZOE: What's so funny?
- Now, I see. Ajest.

177
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:28,416
Three people. So you come
from another world, do you, Doctor?

178
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:30,010
- Hey, I don't think...
- Really, Cully,

179
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:32,975
you and your friends might at least
have agreed upon the same story.

180
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:36,811
What? But these aren't my three, you old...

181
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:37,886
Oh, what's the use?

182
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,251
- JAMIE: What was he talking about?
- I don't know.

183
00:09:39,337 --> 00:09:41,726
Look, I've never seen
this gentleman before in my life.

184
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:44,411
Cully, you had no right to bring
these people here without permission,

185
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:47,011
even if you are the son
of the director of the council.

186
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:48,416
Well, go on, then.
Why don't you call him up?

187
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:51,375
At least he's not as stupid as you are.

188
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,608
- You say you've seen a spacecraft?
- I've told you, haven't I?

189
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:56,528
And robots. Well, at least I think
they were robots.

190
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:58,573
What exactly did this spacecraft look like?

191
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:01,376
Well, it's large and circular
and a sort of silvery colour.

192
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:03,209
That means it can't be the Tardis.

193
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:05,970
Are you sure it wasn't square,
like a large wooden box?

194
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:07,888
No, no, that's not the spacecraft.

195
00:10:07,977 --> 00:10:11,413
No, the box is where
those aliens have made a sort of mark,

196
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:12,646
a five-pointed star.

197
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,331
They were examining it just now.
Talking about destroying it.

198
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,486
- What?  - What?

199
00:10:16,577 --> 00:10:17,805
- Jamie, we better go and see.
- Come on.

200
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:19,012
You're wasting your time.

201
00:10:19,097 --> 00:10:20,849
I prefer to make up my own mind, thank you.

202
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:22,655
Jamie. Are you coming, Zoe?

203
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:24,329
- No, I think I'll stay here.  - Right.

204
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:25,985
- Come on, then.
- We shan't be a minute.

205
00:10:26,537 --> 00:10:29,370
Commence work on preparing the sites
of the outer bore hole.

206
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:32,290
- At once, Navigator Rago.
- Send this message to Fleet Leader.

207
00:10:32,377 --> 00:10:34,572
"Materials located. Detailed report follows."

208
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:36,409
Command accepted.

209
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:39,570
JAMIE: At least they haven't harmed the Tardis.

210
00:10:39,657 --> 00:10:40,806
DOCTOR: That's a relief.

211
00:10:40,897 --> 00:10:42,489
Jamie, come and have a look at this.
It's interesting.

212
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:43,771
- Look. See. - What?

213
00:10:43,857 --> 00:10:44,926
What's so interesting about that?

214
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:47,292
Well, I think it must be
some sort of survey mark.

215
00:10:47,377 --> 00:10:48,890
Very likely.

216
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:50,569
Jamie, look.

217
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,412
- Some sort of tracks.  - So they are.

218
00:10:57,137 --> 00:10:59,207
We'll follow them, shall we?

219
00:11:13,737 --> 00:11:15,932
Oh, look, I think we'd better get back.

220
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:18,406
Zoe will be wondering what's happening...

221
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:21,933
Well, this is interesting. Yes.

222
00:11:22,017 --> 00:11:27,933
Obviously an interstellar spaceship
of considerably advanced design.

223
00:11:29,217 --> 00:11:32,095
Oh, no. You're not thinking
what I think you're thinking, are you?

224
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:34,930
That, I think, Jamie, depends
on what you think I am thinking.

225
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:36,530
Oh.

226
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:38,653
- Hey, Doctor. - Stop that, Jamie.

227
00:11:38,737 --> 00:11:39,886
- Doctor. - Jamie, don't do it.

228
00:11:39,977 --> 00:11:42,172
- Doctor, look. Look.  - Oh, my word.

229
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:46,455
QUARK: <i>Do not move. Do not move.</i>

230
00:11:46,537 --> 00:11:48,846
<i>Next task?</i>

231
00:11:48,937 --> 00:11:51,497
<i>Shall we destroy?</i>

232
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:59,262
Oh, good heavens!

233
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:03,140
Look, what's going on? Who are you?

234
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,176
We are Dominators.

235
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,542
Both of you stand by that wall.

236
00:12:08,907 --> 00:12:10,545
- I will not.
- Oh, now, Jamie...

237
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:13,460
- Oh, no. They're not going to...
- We're meant to be obeyed.

238
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:15,697
- Not by me, you're not.
- DOCTOR: Jamie!

239
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:19,420
What... All right, if you insist.

240
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:20,940
(WARBLING)

241
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:23,664
Doctor, I can't move. Help me!

242
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:25,021
(DOCTOR EXCLAIMING)

243
00:12:25,107 --> 00:12:27,018
It is pointless to struggle.

244
00:12:27,107 --> 00:12:31,464
My Quarks have used a molecular force
to bind your bodies to the wall.

245
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:33,777
What's he going to do with us?

246
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:43,463
Alien races are occasionally of use to us.

247
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:46,459
I intend to probe your physiological makeup.

248
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:47,775
Do what?

249
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:51,982
- Doctor, can you not do anything?
- Don't struggle, Jamie. Keep still.

250
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:55,139
Toba. Quarks, attach force units.

251
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:02,583
- Activate. -(WARBLING)

252
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:04,066
RAGO: Visor.

253
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:09,740
Transmatter focus probe.
fixme

254
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:20,457
Brittle skeletal structure.

255
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:23,381
Reasonable flexibility.

256
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:27,255
Certain amount of muscular force,
could be marginally useful.

257
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:32,461
- Vulnerable, only one heart.
- TOBA: Intelligence?

258
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:38,139
A simple brain. Signs of recent rapid learning.

259
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:40,263
Still, somewhat crude.

260
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:43,464
Shall I prepare the other specimen for scrutiny?

261
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:46,505
No, they will be identical.

262
00:13:48,587 --> 00:13:50,100
Conserve power.

263
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:58,818
- TOBA: Are they dangerous?
- No, they are physically inferior.

264
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:01,296
- So we destroy them?  - No.

265
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:04,299
- It is possible we may use them.
- What for?

266
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:06,025
- Workforce.  - We've got the Quarks.

267
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:08,496
We must conserve their power, you know that.

268
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:10,418
But why do you want...

269
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,705
Command accepted.

270
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:16,138
Set up a reaction test.

271
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,539
Test this one.

272
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:25,337
As soon as your friends return,

273
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:28,783
they will follow you and Cully
in the second capsule.

274
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:32,265
Wouldn't it be better
if all four of us went together?

275
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:34,941
- Travel capsules only take two.
- Number one ready.

276
00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:36,938
There's nothing to be afraid of, you know.

277
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:39,382
Oh, I'm not frightened.
I'm looking forward to it.

278
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:42,140
Come on, let's try and stir up
a bit of action in the capital.

279
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:45,219
You really mustn't believe
Cully's wild tales.

280
00:14:46,347 --> 00:14:47,575
(DOOR HUMMING)

281
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:53,259
I will dial for the capital, Cully,
if you don't mind.

282
00:14:53,347 --> 00:14:55,577
I see. Frightened I might disappear, eh?

283
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,419
Well, it has been known, hasn't it, Cully?

284
00:14:57,507 --> 00:14:59,862
It'd be a joke if it happened
this time, though, wouldn't it?

285
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:08,482
And if we are to use these Dulcians as slaves,

286
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:11,127
there are certain qualities you must look for.

287
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:14,677
Obedience, strength, sufficient intelligence
to make them of use,

288
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:16,883
but not so much as to make them dangerous.
Is that clear?

289
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:18,002
Yes.

290
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:20,555
Uh, what are they saying?

291
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:23,605
I think they are arranging
for some sort of test.

292
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:26,076
- Test? What for?  - I don't know.

293
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:29,159
I thought I heard them
mention the word "intelligence".

294
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:31,397
Oh, you mean they're going to
find out how clever we are?

295
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:34,479
Yes. Or how stupid.

296
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:37,917
I wonder which is the more important to them?

297
00:15:38,127 --> 00:15:41,403
Well, then, Zoe, what were you doing on the island?

298
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:44,047
Well, nothing, really, just looking around.

299
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:48,245
- But didn't you know it was dangerous?
- No. At least not at first.

300
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:52,596
Oh, Cully, how can your conscience allow you

301
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:55,997
to expose innocent and foolish people
to such dangers?

302
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:58,760
- But I didn't take her to the island.
- Oh, nonsense.

303
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:02,681
I know all about Cully's Adventures Unlimited.

304
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:05,645
- You know, but why didn't you...
- Well, you weren't doing any harm.

305
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:07,922
- At least we thought you weren't.
- But it's illegal.

306
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:11,317
To prosecute would have given you open publicity

307
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:14,524
and it wouldn't have reflected very well on me, either.

308
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,724
I see. Why can't I be treated as an individual

309
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:20,640
and not always as the son of the Director?

310
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:25,482
Now then, young lady, tell me exactly what happened.

311
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:28,356
Well, I landed with the Doctor and Jamie.

312
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:31,166
- In Cully's ship, yes?  - Cully?

313
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:35,035
- Oh, no. We came in the Tardis.
- And what is that?

314
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,836
- It's an advanced craft for travel.
- Goes through time and space.

315
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:41,202
I think this joke has gone far enough.

316
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:42,720
There you are, I knew he wouldn't believe it.

317
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:45,082
But it's true! You can ask the Doctor and Jamie,

318
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,486
they'll be here soon.

319
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,842
What do you hope to gain by this foolishness?

320
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:52,203
But it's not. I told you when
we spoke on the vision link.

321
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:54,960
Three people have been killed,
a spacecraft has landed,

322
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,801
radioactivity has disappeared
and there are robots on that island.

323
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,798
Now, I may have a pretty inventive mind,

324
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,037
but I wouldn't have dreamt up
that lot, now, would I?

325
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,402
And no doubt you will confirm all this?

326
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:09,639
Uh, well, I haven't actually seen
the spacecraft and robots...

327
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:13,686
Oh, so it seems we only have
your word for it, Cully.

328
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:17,316
And experience has taught us
how little that can be relied upon.

329
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:19,519
What's he up to now?

330
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:23,881
He's arranging some sort of
intelligence test, Jamie.

331
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,925
JAMIE: You mean those wee shapes
in that big box? What for?

332
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:30,841
Yes, well, we'll have to put
the right shapes into the correct holes,

333
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:32,360
it's quite simple.

334
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:34,915
Well, if that's all it is,
a kid of two could do it.

335
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:38,920
Yes, that's what bothering me.
It's too simple.

336
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,564

From your reaction

511
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:24,700
and your lack of knowledge
of the way of life on Dulkis,

512
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:26,857
it would seem there is some truth in your story

513
00:26:26,947 --> 00:26:28,300
that you're from another planet.

514
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,661
Of course there's some truth!

515
00:26:29,747 --> 00:26:32,386
Look, it was your people who thought
we were friends of Cully's.

516
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:36,052
The identity of my son's companions
can now be established,

517
00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:38,535
though what has happened to them
is not quite clear.

518
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:40,822
But Cully has told you they were murdered.

519
00:26:40,907 --> 00:26:42,056

I would be grateful if you could tell me
what occurred on the island.

Oh, we wouldn't stand a chance.
These Quarks are deadly.

530
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:10,958
- Any idea how they're powered?  - No. Why?

531
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,322
Well, if we knew, we might be able
to put them out of action.

532
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:15,796
Attack them? Are you out of your mind?

533
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:17,286
Well, they're only robots.

00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:18,720

535
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:22,357
Do you really think we could destroy one?

536
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:25,245
It'd be easier if we had a gun of some...

537
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:27,804
- The laser gun!  - Eh?

538
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:30,526

- I'll cut across those cliffs.
- I'll go this way.

00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:08,202
They said you'll all die with your planet.

684
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:10,926
Surely they don't mean to destroy Dulkis completely?

685
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:13,999
- DOCTOR: I'm afraid they do.
- But why? What do they want?

686
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:17,124
A large amount of fuel for their invasion fleet.

687
00:36:17,207 --> 00:36:19,516
But we know that there are no minerals worth having,

688
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:21,279
at least not on this side of the island.

689
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:24,439
They're not mining for minerals
or any natural fuel source.

690
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:27,405
But their spaceships use atomic power.
We've established that.

691
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:29,682
But there was no reactor in that ship of theirs,

692
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:32,565
only a radiation storage unit.

693
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:33,921
You remember how when they landed

694
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:36,475
it sucked up all the radioactive dust
from the island?

695
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:40,321
Yes. So you're saying
that they store radioactive particles

696
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,125
and then convert that energy into power.

697
00:36:42,207 --> 00:36:43,242
Exactly!

698
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:44,726
Well, then why are they drilling?

699
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:46,604
Look, I'll show you.

700
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:53,083
There are four drill holes
here, here, here and here,

701
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,556
and one drill hole in the centre.

702
00:36:55,647 --> 00:37:00,562
Now, then, they have rockets mounted
in each of these drill holes,

703
00:37:00,647 --> 00:37:04,720
and the centre drill hole is probably
for that atomic seed device.

704
00:37:06,847 --> 00:37:07,882
Oh.

705
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,483
Well, don't you see?

706
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:15,595
They've chosen this spot because
the crust of the planet is thin.

707
00:37:15,687 --> 00:37:19,802
They're going to fire the rockets through the crust

708
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:22,359
into the magma, the molten core.

709
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:24,961
ZOE: Then that will almost certainly
fracture the crust of the planet.

710
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:26,196
Exactly.

711
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,721
But that will create a volcano.

712
00:37:28,807 --> 00:37:31,765
And if they explode the atomic
seed device in the middle of that...

713
00:37:31,847 --> 00:37:33,565
Yes, that's right, Zoe.

714
00:37:33,647 --> 00:37:38,323
The whole planet will become one vast
molten mass of radioactive material,

715
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:40,238
the fuel store for their fleet.

716
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:43,319
Well, we'll just have to stop them, then.

717
00:37:43,407 --> 00:37:46,797
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie,
it's not as simple as that, is it?

718
00:37:46,887 --> 00:37:49,845
If only I could get hold of
that atomic seed device,

719
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:51,804
I might be able to defuse it.

720
00:37:51,887 --> 00:37:55,675
Yes, then there'd only be a local
volcanic eruption on the island.

721
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,439
- Yes... - But how can we get to the device?

722
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:58,562
Yes, that's the problem.

723
00:37:58,647 --> 00:37:59,682
Doctor, I've just had an idea.

724
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:01,246
Shush a minute, Jamie, I'm trying to think.

725
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:02,362
- Yes, I know you are, but...  - Oh, Jamie!

726
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,039
Now, listen! Will you listen to me?

727
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:06,687
Now, there's a dead-easy way
to get that device thing.

728
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:08,041
- Really?  - Yes, now listen.

729
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:10,687
You said they were going to drop it
down the centre hole,

730
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:12,598
the one they're drilling outside here.

731
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:13,722
- Right?  - DOCTOR: Yes.

732
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:15,399
Well, it's simple, isn't it?

733
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:19,241
All we've got to do is dig a tunnel
through from here to the borehole

734
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:22,205
and catch the seed device thing on its way down!

735
00:38:22,287 --> 00:38:24,596
Oh. Well, it was just an idea.

736
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:26,765
But Jamie...

737
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:30,396
It's a brilliant idea!

738
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:32,557
It's so simple,
only you could have thought of it.

739
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:34,638
Oh! Hey?

740
00:38:35,207 --> 00:38:37,004
We can get the direction from the periscope.

741
00:38:37,087 --> 00:38:38,725
Just line it up with the drilling site.

742
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:42,322
Yes, there's only one snag, though.
Could we complete the tunnel in time?

743
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:43,999
It'd have to be 12 feet long or more.

744
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:46,317
Well, Cully and I could delay
the Dominators' work up there.

745
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,442
ZOE: How?

746
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:50,121
Oh, we're getting very good
at destroying Quarks, aren't we?

747
00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:51,606
Yes, certainly seems to stop them working.

748
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:53,882
DOCTOR: Yes, that's true,
but you've been lucky so far.

749
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,481
If only I could devise some sort of weapon for you.

750
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,364
- Is there anything down here, Cully?
- No, I doubt it.

751
00:38:58,447 --> 00:39:00,278
Nothing but survival rations and medical kit.

752
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:03,086
Medical kit? Oh!

753
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:04,600

754
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:07,724
with a few simple chemicals and a little ingenuity.

755
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:09,399
Now, come on, we must dig this tunnel.

00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:12,763
- Zoe, give us a direction, will you?  - Right.

757
00:39:12,847 --> 00:39:15,361
On a line from...here.

758
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:18,564
Right! We start the tunnel there.
Get that bunk away, come on.

759
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,684
That's it, Cully. I'll start with a knife, now...

761
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:26,155
I think you'd better let me start it, Jamie.

762
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:28,886
How are you going to dig through there
with your sonic screwdriver?

763
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:32,437

Good. I shall enjoy destroying
this planet and its creatures.

We will delay no longer.

- Well, there IS an emergency unit, but...

852
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:10,237
- I can't possibly use that.
- But this IS an emergency!

853
00:44:10,407 --> 00:44:14,844
But it moves the Tardis out of the
time-space dimension, out of reality!

854
00:44:15,007 --> 00:44:18,317
Fine. Reality's getting too hot, anyway!

855
00:44:19,487 --> 00:44:21,876
Oh, all right.

856
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:26,678
Here we are.

857
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:28,838
Now, then, which end was...?

858
00:44:29,007 --> 00:44:30,679
Yes...

859
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:34,522
I can't possibly use this.
We don't know what will happen.
