that other weapons

you don't seem the least bit surprised.

We are taught to accept fact,

in the face of reality.

We've got to get back to the capital.

- Now, I see. Ajest.
- 什么这么好笑？  - 啊, 我明白了．笑话

174
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:28,416
Three people. So you come
from another world, do you, Doctor?
三个人．所以你们是从另外一个世界来的, 是吗, 博士？

175
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:30,010
- Hey, I don't think...
- Really, Cully,
- 嘿, 我不认为...  - 真的, Cully

176

you and your friends might at least
have agreed upon the same story.
你和你的朋友们至少应该先勾兑一下故事的说法

What? But these aren't my three, you old...
什么？但这并不是我那三个人, 你个老...

- I don't know.

Look, I've never seen
this gentleman before in my life.
听着, 我这辈子从来没见过这位先生

181
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:44,411
Cully, you had no right to bring
these people here without permission,
Cully, 你不能未获得任何授权就带这三个人到这里来

182

even if you are the son
of the director of the council.

Why don't you call him up?

At least he's not as stupid as you are.
至少他不像你这么蠢

and a sort of silvery colour.
哦, 巨大的圆形, 带着某种银色

189
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:03,209
That means it can't be the Tardis.

What's so interesting about that?

Very likely.

噢, 别, 你不是在想我觉得你在想的事情吧, 是吗？
