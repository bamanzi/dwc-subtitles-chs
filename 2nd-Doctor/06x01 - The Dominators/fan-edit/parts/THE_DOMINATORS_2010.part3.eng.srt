00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,705
Complete destruction.

4
00:25:50,187 --> 00:25:51,779
Maybe you'll believe in my robots now.

5
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:54,097
I don't know about robots,
but something was attacking us,

6
00:25:54,187 --> 00:25:55,859
and with pretty sophisticated weapons, too.

7
00:25:55,947 --> 00:25:57,585
Well, whatever it was,
we'd better get out of here fast.

8
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:59,458
Let's try and move this door.

9
00:26:00,087 --> 00:26:03,523
Unnecessary destruction is wasteful.
Did you inspect it?

10
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:06,041
All relevant details have been recorded.

11
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:09,119
See if there are any survivors
and bring them to me.

12
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:10,435
Alive.

13
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:16,042
- Come on! Keep it... - Oh!

14
00:26:20,307 --> 00:26:21,786
From your reaction

15
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:24,700
and your lack of knowledge
of the way of life on Dulkis,

16
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:26,857
it would seem there is some truth in your story

17
00:26:26,947 --> 00:26:28,300
that you're from another planet.

18
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,661
Of course there's some truth!

19
00:26:29,747 --> 00:26:32,386
Look, it was your people who thought
we were friends of Cully's.

20
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:36,052
The identity of my son's companions
can now be established,

21
00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:38,535
though what has happened to them
is not quite clear.

22
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:40,822
But Cully has told you they were murdered.

23
00:26:40,907 --> 00:26:42,056
And I believe him!

24
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:43,660
(COUNCILLORS MURMURING) Why?

25
00:26:44,107 --> 00:26:46,462
Because I have seen these Dominators!

26
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:48,822
We were just taken aboard their spacecraft.

27
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,441
Believe me, they're callous, without pity!

28

(COUNCILLORS MURMURING)

29
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:56,337
I would be grateful if you could tell me
what occurred on the island.

30
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:58,731
Oh, look here, we've told you!

31
00:26:58,847 --> 00:27:02,078
We're just wasting time talking
while Zoe's in danger!

32
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:06,161
Can't we get away?

33
00:27:06,247 --> 00:27:08,886
Oh, we wouldn't stand a chance.
These Quarks are deadly.

34
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:10,958
- Any idea how they're powered?  - No. Why?

35
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,322
Well, if we knew, we might be able
to put them out of action.

36
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:15,796
Attack them? Are you out of your mind?

37
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:17,286
Well, they're only robots.

38
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:18,720
"Only"?

39
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:22,357
Do you really think we could destroy one?

40
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:25,245
It'd be easier if we had a gun of some...

41
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:27,804
- The laser gun!  - Eh?

42
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:30,526
Cully, I think we stand a chance.

43
00:27:32,387 --> 00:27:34,184

45
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:47,664
I'll set them to work on the drilling site.

46

Work potential and stamina
to be recorded and sent for analysis.

47
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:54,020
Agreed. If any of them should escape...

48
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:58,385
Then you will report the fact to me,
no personal action.

49

50
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:06,017

51

Hey, would you look down there?

52
00:28:11,947 --> 00:28:14,859
That's the ruined building. Hello.

53
00:28:16,307 --> 00:28:17,660
What can you see?

54
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:21,680
- JAMIE: It's Zoe and Cully!
- We've got to get down there!

55
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:26,446
Jamie, we'll split up
and get round the back of them.

56
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:28,279
- I'll cut across those cliffs.
- I'll go this way.

57
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:32,756
- Ready?  - Yes.

58
00:28:32,847 --> 00:28:36,362
Once you're inside, give me time to
get the two Quarks into your line of fire.

59
00:28:36,447 --> 00:28:37,721

71

You were told to keep away from the Quarks.

72
00:29:48,707 --> 00:29:49,981
Oh, but I do.

73
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:52,581
Whenever I see one, I go away.

74
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,784
But they're all over the island,
where can I go?

75
00:30:01,727 --> 00:30:04,782
Stop! One of them is missing.

We daren't wait any longer.

- Do you think he saw me?
- TOBA: I know you're in there, Cully!
