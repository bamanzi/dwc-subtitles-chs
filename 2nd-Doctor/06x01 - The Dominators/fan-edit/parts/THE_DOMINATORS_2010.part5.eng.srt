Hey, Cully, would you look who's here?

2
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:12,442
Any Quarks?

3
00:32:12,527 --> 00:32:14,597
CULLY: Yes, one.
JAMIE: Hmm.

4
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:18,236
CULLY: No, there's more.
Can't quite see,

5
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:20,887
but I think they're working at something
just outside the building.

6
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:22,958
JAMIE: Let's have a look.

7
00:32:23,807 --> 00:32:25,718
They don't seem to have harmed anybody.

8
00:32:25,807 --> 00:32:26,922
Well, Balan isn't there.

9
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:29,646
He's probably working somewhere else.

10
00:32:29,727 --> 00:32:30,921
-Look, Cully...
-What now?

11
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:32,360
We can't just let them stay
up there, can we?

12
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:34,403
-Well, what can we do?
-Get them down here with us.

13
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:36,000
-But what about the Quarks?
-Well, we'll...

14

00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:55,122
Hmm?

21
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:58,406
I don't think they want to take
anything out of the Earth, Zo�,

22
00:32:58,487 --> 00:33:00,079
rather put something into it.

Why has the drilling
stopped again, Toba?

a Quark and escaped!

Nowhere on the island is safe.

Nowhere on the entire planet,
come to that!

73
00:35:59,127 --> 00:36:01,197
You see, we heard
the Dominators say that the Dulcians

74
00:36:01,287 --> 00:36:02,686
were unsuitable of slave labour.

-Well, no.

76

They said you'll all die
with your planet.

77
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:10,926
Surely they don't mean
to destroy Dulkis completely?

78
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:13,999
-DOCTOR: I'm afraid they do.
-But why? What do they want?

79
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:17,124
A large amount of fuel
for their invasion fleet.

80
00:36:17,207 --> 00:36:19,516
But we know that there are
no minerals worth having,

81
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:21,279
at least not on this side of the island.

82
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:24,439
They're not mining for minerals
or any natural fuel source.

83
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:27,405
But their spaceships use atomic power.
We've established that.

84
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:29,682
But there was no reactor
in that ship of theirs,

85
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:32,565
only a radiation storage unit.

86
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:33,921
You remember how when they landed

87
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:36,475
it sucked up all the radioactive dust
from the island?

88
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:40,321
Yes. So you're saying
that they store radioactive particles

89
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,125
and then convert that energy into power.

90
00:36:42,207 --> 00:36:43,242
Exactly!

91
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:44,726
Well, then why are they drilling?

92
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:46,604
Look, I'll show you.

93
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:53,083
There are four drill holes
here, here, here and here,

94
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,556
and one drill hole in the centre.

95
00:36:55,647 --> 00:37:00,562
Now, then, they have rockets mounted
in each of these drill holes,

96
00:37:00,647 --> 00:37:04,720
and the centre drill hole is probably
for that atomic seed device.

97
00:37:06,847 --> 00:37:07,882
Oh.

98
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,483
Well, don't you see?

99
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:15,595
They've chosen this spot because
the crust of the planet is thin.

100
00:37:15,687 --> 00:37:20,602
They're going to fire the rockets
through the crust into the magma,

101
00:37:20,687 --> 00:37:22,359
the molten core.

102
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:24,961
ZO�: Then that will almost certainly
fracture the crust of the planet.

103
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:26,196
Exactly.

104
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,721
But that will create a volcano.

105
00:37:28,807 --> 00:37:31,765
And if they explode the atomic
seed device in the middle of that...

106
00:37:31,847 --> 00:37:33,565
Yes, that's right, Zo�.

107
00:37:33,647 --> 00:37:38,323
The whole planet will become one vast
molten mass of radioactive material,

108
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:40,238
the fuel store for their fleet.

109
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:43,319
Well, we'll just have to
stop them, then.

110
00:37:43,407 --> 00:37:46,797
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie,
it's not as simple as that, is it?

111
00:37:46,887 --> 00:37:49,845
If only I could get hold of
that atomic seed device,

112
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:51,804
I might be able to defuse it.

113
00:37:51,887 --> 00:37:55,675
Yes, then there'd only be a local
volcanic eruption on the island.

114
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,439
-Yes...
-But how can we get to the device?

115
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:58,562
Yes, that's the problem.

116
00:37:58,647 --> 00:37:59,682
Doctor, I've just had an idea.

117
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:01,246
Shush a minute, Jamie,
I'm trying to think.

118
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:02,362
-Yes, I know you are, but...
-Oh, Jamie!

119
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,039
Now, listen! Will you listen to me?

120
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:06,687
Now, there's a dead-easy way
to get that device thing.

121
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:08,041
-Really?
-Yes, now listen.

122
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:10,687
You said they were going to drop it
down the centre hole,

123
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:12,598
the one they're drilling outside here.

124
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:13,722
-Right?
-DOCTOR: Yes.

125
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:15,399
Well, it's simple, isn't it?

126
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:19,241
All we've got to do is dig a tunnel
through from here to the borehole

127
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:22,205
and catch the seed device thing
on its way down!

128
00:38:22,287 --> 00:38:24,596
Oh. Well, it was just an idea.

129
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:26,765
But Jamie...

130
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:30,396
It's a brilliant idea!

131
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:32,557
It's so simple,
only you could have thought of it.

132
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:34,638
Oh! Hey?

133
00:38:35,207 --> 00:38:37,004
We can get the direction
from the periscope.

134
00:38:37,087 --> 00:38:38,725
Just line it up with the drilling site.

135
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:42,322
Yes, there's only one snag, though.
Could we complete the tunnel in time?

136
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:43,999
It'd have to be 12 feet long or more.

137
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:46,317
Well, Cully and I could delay
the Dominators' work up there.

at destroying Quarks, aren't we?

00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:51,606
Yes, certainly seems
to stop them working.

141
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:53,882
DOCTOR: Yes, that's true,
but you've been lucky so far.

142
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,481
If only I could devise
some sort of weapon for you.

143
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,364
-Is there anything down here, Cully?
-No, I doubt it.

144
00:38:58,447 --> 00:39:00,278

and medical kit.

145

Medical kit? Oh!

It's surprising what you can do

147
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:07,724
with a few simple chemicals
and a little ingenuity.

148
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:09,399
Now, come on, we must dig this tunnel.

149
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:12,763
-Zo�, give us a direction, will you?
-Right.

150
00:39:12,847 --> 00:39:15,361

151
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:18,564
Right! We start the tunnel there.
Get that bunk away, come on.

152

I'll start with a knife, now...

153

154
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:26,155
I think you'd better
let me start it, Jamie.

155
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:28,886
How are you going to dig through there
with your sonic screwdriver?

156
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:32,437
It's a little more than a screwdriver.
Just watch this.

Very soon we shall see this planet die,
and its creatures with it.

174
00:40:26,347 --> 00:40:28,258
Shall I report to Fleet Leader?

175
00:40:28,347 --> 00:40:31,783
Inform him the Dominator fleet
may approach on its refuelling orbit.

176
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:34,142
Command accepted. Quarks, follow.

177

(QUARKS BLEEPING)

178
00:40:35,827 --> 00:40:37,545
Quickly, Doctor!

179
00:40:37,627 --> 00:40:40,380
He's taking the device
out of its case now.

180
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:44,938
Oh, Jamie, he'll be too late!
He's putting it in now.

181
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:46,824
-It's gone!
-DOCTOR: Oh!

182
00:40:46,907 --> 00:40:48,659
JAMIE: Doctor, have you caught it?

183
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:50,305
-Oh, Doctor!
-He's coming!

184
00:40:50,387 --> 00:40:52,059
JAMIE: Quick, out.

185
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:54,182
Well?

186
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:55,736
(LAUGHING)

187
00:40:55,827 --> 00:40:58,136
-Oh, thank goodness!
-We're saved! We're saved, then!

188
00:40:58,227 --> 00:40:59,262
No, not just yet.

189
00:40:59,347 --> 00:41:02,100
I've still got to defuse it
before they explode it.

190
00:41:02,187 --> 00:41:05,099
-Oh! Oh, my word!
-ZO�: What?

191
00:41:05,187 --> 00:41:08,463
Well, it's sealed!
It's completely sealed!

192
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:10,026
I can't possibly undo it!

193
00:41:10,107 --> 00:41:12,496
You mean, all that was for nothing?
We're still going to get blown up?

194
00:41:12,587 --> 00:41:14,464
Yes, I'm afraid so,
unless I can think of some way

195
00:41:14,547 --> 00:41:16,777
of getting it off the planet
without a...

196
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:18,585
Have you thought of something?

197
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:20,783
Well, there is a way
of getting it off the planet

198
00:41:20,867 --> 00:41:23,097
without it doing any harm
to any of us at all.

199
00:41:23,187 --> 00:41:24,176
ZO�: Well, how?

200
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:26,735
Ah! But it's not going to be easy...

201
00:41:26,827 --> 00:41:27,816
What? What are you going to do?

202
00:41:27,907 --> 00:41:30,375
Now, just leave it to me, Jamie, hmm?

203
00:41:30,467 --> 00:41:32,298
You, Zo� go back to the Tardis.

204
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:33,776
RAGO: Is all prepared?

205
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,335
Yes, just two more Quarks to arrive.

206
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,746
Start takeoff procedure.

207
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:39,419
Command accepted.

(CAPSULE BEEPING)

209
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:19,200
Oh, where is he?

210
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:21,596
The Dominators' ship, it's away!

211
00:42:22,087 --> 00:42:23,998
-Oh!
-Where's the Doctor?

212
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:25,076
Doctor!

213
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,839
-Hey, where's the bomb thing?
-Oh, did you get rid of it?

214
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:29,282
-Well, where is it?
-(PANTING) Don't ask so many questions.

215
00:42:29,367 --> 00:42:30,516
-What?
-There's no time.

(EXPLOSIONS)

217
00:42:32,447 --> 00:42:33,516
What's that?

218
00:42:33,607 --> 00:42:36,599
It's the rockets
in the other perimeter holes.

219
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:39,637
Come along, we'd better
get inside the Tardis.

220
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:40,796
There's going to be an...

221
00:42:40,887 --> 00:42:42,525
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

222
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:43,756
Toba!

223
00:42:49,647 --> 00:42:51,603
Doctor, come on, will you?
The whole place is going to blow up!

224
00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:54,645
Oh, it's quite all right, Jamie.
The planet is quite safe.

225
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:56,922
There's just going to be
a localised volcanic eruption.

226
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,440
It'll only affect the island.

227
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:02,406
Maybe so, but we happen
to be on the island.

228
00:43:02,487 --> 00:43:03,886
Oh, my word! Oh, oh!
