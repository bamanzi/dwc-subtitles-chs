00:32:07,047 --> 00:32:09,686
Hey, Cully, would you look who's here?

2
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:12,442
Any Quarks?

3
00:32:12,527 --> 00:32:14,597
- CULLY: Yes, one.  - JAMIE: Hmm.

4
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:18,236
CULLY: No, there's more. Can't quite see,

5
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:20,887
but I think they're working at something
just outside the building.

6
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:22,958
JAMIE: Let's have a look.

7
00:32:23,807 --> 00:32:25,718
They don't seem to have harmed anybody.

8
00:32:25,807 --> 00:32:26,922
Well, Balan isn't there.

9
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:29,646
He's probably working somewhere else.

10
00:32:29,727 --> 00:32:30,921
- Look, Cully...  - What now?

11
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:32,360
We can't just let them stay up there, can we?

12
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:34,403
- Well, what can we do?
- Get them down here with us.

13
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:36,000
- But what about the Quarks?  - Well, we'll...

14
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,647
Here we go again.

00:32:48,687 --> 00:32:50,564
What are they doing?

18
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:51,716
They're drilling.

19
00:32:51,807 --> 00:32:53,923
Well, yes, I know that, but what for?

20
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:55,122
Hmm?

21
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:58,406
I don't think they want to take
anything out of the Earth, Zoe,

22
00:32:58,487 --> 00:33:00,079
rather put something into it.

23
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:02,727
- Well, what?  - Well, if I'm right...

24
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:04,035
Oh, no!

00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,116

37
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:26,723
QUARK: <i>Out of action.</i>

Why has the drilling stopped again, Toba?

43
00:34:38,647 --> 00:34:40,842
The prisoners have attacked
a Quark and escaped!

44
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:44,158
And once again you've dropped
everything to hunt them!

45

the remaining power levels of the Quark force.

Thanks to your foolish actions,
they are dangerously low!

47
00:34:51,287 --> 00:34:54,359
All efforts must now be concentrated
on completing our mission.

48
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:55,641
And if they attack us again?

49
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,195
The Quark's power must be conserved.

50
00:34:58,287 --> 00:34:59,879

Toba, the primitives will not go unpunished.

54
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:11,445
the Dulcians are unsuitable for slave labour.

55
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:14,601
They will die with their planet.

That was very rash of you, Jamie.
Those Quarks are appallingly dangerous.

63

Och, they're not so terrible.

You know, we dropped a rock on one earlier.

Hey, where's Balan? Why wasn't he...

66
00:35:43,087 --> 00:35:45,442
He's dead, Cully. The Dominators killed him.

67
00:35:45,527 --> 00:35:48,758
Oh, no! If only we'd managed to get him away, too.

You did your best, Cully.

It's thanks to you and Jamie
that the rest of us are safe.

70
00:35:52,847 --> 00:35:56,283
DOCTOR: I'm afraid not.
Nowhere on the island is safe.

71
00:35:56,927 --> 00:35:59,043
Nowhere on the entire planet, come to that!

72
00:35:59,127 --> 00:36:00,397
You see, we heard the Dominators say

73
00:36:01,287 --> 00:36:02,686
that the Dulcians were unsuitable of slave labour.

74
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:05,759
- But then they'll leave us in peace!
- Well, no.

75
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:08,202
They said you'll all die with your planet.

76
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:10,926
Surely they don't mean to destroy Dulkis completely?

77
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:13,999
- DOCTOR: I'm afraid they do.
- But why? What do they want?

78
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:17,124
A large amount of fuel for their invasion fleet.

79
00:36:17,207 --> 00:36:19,516
But we know that there are no minerals worth having,

80
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:21,279
at least not on this side of the island.

81
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:24,439
They're not mining for minerals
or any natural fuel source.

82
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:27,405
But their spaceships use atomic power.
We've established that.

83
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:29,682
But there was no reactor in that ship of theirs,

84
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:32,565
only a radiation storage unit.

85
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:33,921
You remember how when they landed

86
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:36,475
it sucked up all the radioactive dust
from the island?

87
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:40,321
Yes. So you're saying
that they store radioactive particles

88
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,125
and then convert that energy into power.

89
00:36:42,207 --> 00:36:43,242
Exactly!

90
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:44,726
Well, then why are they drilling?

91
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:46,604
Look, I'll show you.

92
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:53,083
There are four drill holes
here, here, here and here,

93
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,556
and one drill hole in the centre.

94
00:36:55,647 --> 00:37:00,562
Now, then, they have rockets mounted
in each of these drill holes,

95
00:37:00,647 --> 00:37:04,720
and the centre drill hole is probably
for that atomic seed device.

96
00:37:06,847 --> 00:37:07,882
Oh.

97
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,483
Well, don't you see?

98
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:15,595
They've chosen this spot because
the crust of the planet is thin.

99
00:37:15,687 --> 00:37:19,802
They're going to fire the rockets through the crust

100
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:22,359
into the magma, the molten core.

101
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:24,961
ZOE: Then that will almost certainly
fracture the crust of the planet.

102
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:26,196
Exactly.

103
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,721
But that will create a volcano.

104
00:37:28,807 --> 00:37:31,765
And if they explode the atomic
seed device in the middle of that...

105
00:37:31,847 --> 00:37:33,565
Yes, that's right, Zoe.

106
00:37:33,647 --> 00:37:38,323
The whole planet will become one vast
molten mass of radioactive material,

107
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:40,238
the fuel store for their fleet.

108
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:43,319
Well, we'll just have to stop them, then.

109
00:37:43,407 --> 00:37:46,797
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie,
it's not as simple as that, is it?

110
00:37:46,887 --> 00:37:49,845
If only I could get hold of
that atomic seed device,

111
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:51,804
I might be able to defuse it.

112
00:37:51,887 --> 00:37:55,675
Yes, then there'd only be a local
volcanic eruption on the island.

113
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,439
- Yes... - But how can we get to the device?

114
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:58,562
Yes, that's the problem.

115
00:37:58,647 --> 00:37:59,682
Doctor, I've just had an idea.

116
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:01,246
Shush a minute, Jamie, I'm trying to think.

117
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:02,362
- Yes, I know you are, but...  - Oh, Jamie!

118
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,039
Now, listen! Will you listen to me?

119
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:06,687
Now, there's a dead-easy way
to get that device thing.

120
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:08,041
- Really?  - Yes, now listen.

121
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:10,687
You said they were going to drop it
down the centre hole,

122
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:12,598
the one they're drilling outside here.

123
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:13,722
- Right?  - DOCTOR: Yes.

124
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:15,399
Well, it's simple, isn't it?

125
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:19,241
All we've got to do is dig a tunnel
through from here to the borehole

126
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:22,205
and catch the seed device thing on its way down!

127
00:38:22,287 --> 00:38:24,596
Oh. Well, it was just an idea.

128
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:26,765
But Jamie...

129
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:30,396
It's a brilliant idea!

130
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:32,557
It's so simple,
only you could have thought of it.

131
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:34,638
Oh! Hey?

132
00:38:35,207 --> 00:38:37,004
We can get the direction from the periscope.

133
00:38:37,087 --> 00:38:38,725
Just line it up with the drilling site.

134
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:42,322
Yes, there's only one snag, though.
Could we complete the tunnel in time?

135
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:43,999
It'd have to be 12 feet long or more.

136
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:46,317
Well, Cully and I could delay
the Dominators' work up there.

137
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,442
ZOE: How?

138
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:50,121
Oh, we're getting very good
at destroying Quarks, aren't we?

139
00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:51,606
Yes, certainly seems to stop them working.

140
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:53,882
DOCTOR: Yes, that's true,
but you've been lucky so far.

141
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,481
If only I could devise some sort of weapon for you.

142
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,364
- Is there anything down here, Cully?
- No, I doubt it.

143
00:38:58,447 --> 00:39:00,278
Nothing but survival rations and medical kit.

144
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:03,086
Medical kit? Oh!

145
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:04,600
It's surprising what you can do

146
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:07,724
with a few simple chemicals and a little ingenuity.

147
00:39:07,807 --> 00:39:09,399
Now, come on, we must dig this tunnel.

148
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:12,763
- Zoe, give us a direction, will you?  - Right.

149
00:39:12,847 --> 00:39:15,361
On a line from...here.

150
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:18,564
Right! We start the tunnel there.
Get that bunk away, come on.

151
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,684
That's it, Cully. I'll start with a knife, now...

152
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:23,598
This line here.

153
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:26,155
I think you'd better let me start it, Jamie.

154
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:28,886
How are you going to dig through there
with your sonic screwdriver?

155
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:32,437
It's a little more than a screwdriver.
Just watch this.

164
00:40:08,947 --> 00:40:10,585
Toba's bringing the seed device.

165
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:11,703
Oh, dear.

166
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:14,017
You will recall all Quarks from their positions

167
00:40:14,107 --> 00:40:15,301
and prepare the craft for takeoff.

169
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:18,697

Very soon we shall see this planet die,
and its creatures with it.

173
00:40:26,347 --> 00:40:28,258
Shall I report to Fleet Leader?

174
00:40:28,347 --> 00:40:31,783
Inform him the Dominator fleet
may approach on its refuelling orbit.

175
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:34,142
Command accepted. Quarks, follow.

(QUARKS BLEEPING)

177
00:40:35,827 --> 00:40:37,545
Quickly, Doctor!

178
00:40:37,627 --> 00:40:40,380
He's taking the device out of its case now.

179
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:44,938
Oh, Jamie, he'll be too late!
He's putting it in now.

180
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:46,824
- It's gone! - DOCTOR: Oh!

181
00:40:46,907 --> 00:40:48,659
JAMIE: Doctor, have you caught it?

182
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:50,305
- Oh, Doctor!  - He's coming!

183
00:40:50,387 --> 00:40:52,059
JAMIE: Quick, out.

184
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:54,182
Well?

185
00:40:54,747 --> 00:40:55,736
(LAUGHING)

186
00:40:55,827 --> 00:40:58,136
- Oh, thank goodness!
- We're saved! We're saved, then!

187
00:40:58,227 --> 00:40:59,262
No, not just yet.

188
00:40:59,347 --> 00:41:02,100
I've still got to defuse it
before they explode it.

189
00:41:02,187 --> 00:41:05,099
- Oh! Oh, my word!  - ZOE: What?

190
00:41:05,187 --> 00:41:08,463
Well, it's sealed! It's completely sealed!

191
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:10,026
I can't possibly undo it!

192
00:41:10,107 --> 00:41:12,496
You mean, all that was for nothing?
We're still going to get blown up?

193
00:41:12,587 --> 00:41:14,464
Yes, I'm afraid so,
unless I can think of some way

194
00:41:14,547 --> 00:41:16,777
of getting it off the planet without a...

195
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:18,585
Have you thought of something?

196
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:20,783
Well, there is a way of getting it off the planet

197
00:41:20,867 --> 00:41:23,097
without it doing any harm to any of us at all.

198
00:41:23,187 --> 00:41:24,176
ZOE: Well, how?

199
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:26,735
Ah! But it's not going to be easy...

200
00:41:26,827 --> 00:41:27,816
What? What are you going to do?

201
00:41:27,907 --> 00:41:30,375
Now, just leave it to me, Jamie, hmm?

202
00:41:30,467 --> 00:41:32,298
You, Zoe go back to the Tardis.

203
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:33,776
RAGO: Is all prepared?

204
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,335
Yes, just two more Quarks to arrive.

205
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,746
Start takeoff procedure.

206
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:39,419
Command accepted.

(CAPSULE BEEPING)

208
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:19,200
Oh, where is he?

209
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:21,596
The Dominators' ship, it's away!

210
00:42:22,087 --> 00:42:23,998
- Oh!  - Where's the Doctor?

211
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:25,076
Doctor!

212
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,839
- Hey, where's the bomb thing?
- Oh, did you get rid of it?

213
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:29,282
- Well, where is it?
- (PANTING) Don't ask so many questions.

214
00:42:29,367 --> 00:42:30,516
- What?  - There's no time.

215
00:42:30,607 --> 00:42:32,006
(EXPLOSIONS)

216
00:42:32,447 --> 00:42:33,516
What's that?

217
00:42:33,607 --> 00:42:36,599
It's the rockets in the other perimeter holes.

218
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:39,637
Come along, we'd better get inside the Tardis.

219
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:40,796
There's going to be an...

220

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

221
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:43,756
Toba!

222
00:42:49,647 --> 00:42:51,603
Doctor, come on, will you?
The whole place is going to blow up!

223
00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:54,645
Oh, it's quite all right, Jamie.
The planet is quite safe.

224
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:57,022
There's just going to be
a localised volcanic eruption.

225
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,440
It'll only affect the island.

226
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:02,406
Maybe so, but we happen to be on the island.

227
00:43:02,487 --> 00:43:03,886
Oh, my word! Oh, oh!
