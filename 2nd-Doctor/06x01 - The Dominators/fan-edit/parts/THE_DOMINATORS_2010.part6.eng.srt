1
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,506
Isn't it beautiful!

2
00:43:12,627 --> 00:43:15,380
- What a wonderful sight!
- Fantastic!

3
00:43:15,547 --> 00:43:19,381
- Get us out of here!
- Don't worry. We're safe in the Tardis.

4
00:43:19,547 --> 00:43:23,620
Are you sure? Has the Tardis
ever been buried in lava before?

5
00:43:23,787 --> 00:43:26,665
- No.
- How can you be sure we'll be all right?

6
00:43:29,327 --> 00:43:30,337
Oh, dear.

7
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:33,544
- Is something wrong?
- This has happened before.

8
00:43:33,707 --> 00:43:36,983
The fluid links aren't able to take the load. Oh!

9
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:39,336
(ZOE) Mercury vapour!

10
00:43:40,187 --> 00:43:44,897
Oh, no! If I can't pull this down,
we'll get stuck. That stupid, idiotic...

11
00:43:45,587 --> 00:43:50,377
- The lava's up to the Tardis!
- (ZOE) It's reached the 1,000 danger mark.

12
00:43:50,807 --> 00:43:52,604
There we are.

13
00:43:52,767 --> 00:43:57,238
- Have you done it?
- It's stopped the fluid links from vaporising.

14
00:43:57,407 --> 00:44:01,639
- We shan't suffocate.
- If we don't hurry, we'll be fried by the lava.

15
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:06,676
- Isn't there any way we can get away?
- Well, there IS an emergency unit, but...

16
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:10,237
- I can't possibly use that.
- But this IS an emergency!

17
00:44:10,407 --> 00:44:14,844
But it moves the Tardis
out of the time-space dimension, out of reality!

18
00:44:15,007 --> 00:44:18,317
Fine. Reality's getting too hot, anyway!

19
00:44:19,487 --> 00:44:21,876
Oh, all right.

20
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:26,678
Here we are.

21
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:28,838
Now, then, which end was...?

22
00:44:29,007 --> 00:44:30,679
Yes...

23
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:34,522
I can't possibly use this.
We don't know what will happen.

24
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,963
Stop your jabbering and get on with it. Look!

25
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:43,635
(PULSATING WHINE)
