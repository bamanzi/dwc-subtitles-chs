00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:03,140
Look, what's going on? Who are you?

3
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,176
We are Dominators.

4
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,542
Both of you stand by that wall.

5
00:12:08,907 --> 00:12:10,545
- I will not.
- Oh, now, Jamie...

6
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:13,460
- Oh, no. They're not going to...
- We're meant to be obeyed.

7
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:15,697
- Not by me, you're not.
- DOCTOR: Jamie!

8
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:19,420
What... All right, if you insist.

10
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:23,664
Doctor, I can't move. Help me!

(DOCTOR EXCLAIMING)

12
00:12:25,107 --> 00:12:27,018
It is pointless to struggle.

13
00:12:27,107 --> 00:12:31,464
My Quarks have used a molecular force
to bind your bodies to the wall.

14
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:33,777
What's he going to do with us?

15
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:43,463
Alien races are occasionally of use to us.

16
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:46,459
I intend to probe your physiological makeup.

17
00:12:46,547 --> 00:12:47,775
Do what?

18
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:51,982
- Doctor, can you not do anything?
- Don't struggle, Jamie. Keep still.

19
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:55,139
Toba. Quarks, attach force units.

20

Reasonable flexibility.

25
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:27,255
Certain amount of muscular force,
could be marginally useful.

26

- Vulnerable, only one heart.
- TOBA: Intelligence?

27
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:38,139
A simple brain. Signs of recent rapid learning.

28
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:40,263
Still, somewhat crude.

29
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:43,464
Shall I prepare the other specimen for scrutiny?

30
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:46,505
No, they will be identical.

31
00:13:48,587 --> 00:13:50,100
Conserve power.

32
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:58,818
- TOBA: Are they dangerous?
- No, they are physically inferior.

33
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:01,296
- So we destroy them?  - No.

34
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:04,299
- It is possible we may use them.
- What for?

35
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:06,025
- Workforce.  - We've got the Quarks.

36
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:08,496
We must conserve their power, you know that.

37
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:10,418
But why do you want...

38
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,705
Command accepted.

39
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:16,138
Set up a reaction test.

40
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,539
Test this one.

41
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:25,337
As soon as your friends return,

42
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:28,783
they will follow you and Cully
in the second capsule.

43
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:32,265
Wouldn't it be better
if all four of us went together?

44
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:34,941
- Travel capsules only take two.
- Number one ready.

45
00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:36,938
There's nothing to be afraid of, you know.

46
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:39,382
Oh, I'm not frightened.
I'm looking forward to it.

47
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:42,140
Come on, let's try and stir up
a bit of action in the capital.

48
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:45,219
You really mustn't believe
Cully's wild tales.

49
00:14:46,347 --> 00:14:47,575
(DOOR HUMMING)

50
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:53,259
I will dial for the capital, Cully,
if you don't mind.

51
00:14:53,347 --> 00:14:55,577
I see. Frightened I might disappear, eh?

52
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,419
Well, it has been known, hasn't it, Cully?

53
00:14:57,507 --> 00:14:59,862
It'd be a joke if it happened
this time, though, wouldn't it?

54
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:08,482
And if we are to use these Dulcians as slaves,

55
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:11,127
there are certain qualities you must look for.

56
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:14,677
Obedience, strength, sufficient intelligence
to make them of use,

57
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:16,883
but not so much as to make them dangerous.
Is that clear?

58
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:18,002
Yes.

59
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:20,555
Uh, what are they saying?

60
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:23,605
I think they are arranging
for some sort of test.

61
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:26,076
- Test? What for?  - I don't know.

62
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:29,159
I thought I heard them
mention the word "intelligence".

63
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:31,397
Oh, you mean they're going to
find out how clever we are?

64
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:34,479
Yes. Or how stupid.

65
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:37,917
I wonder which is the more important to them?

66
00:15:38,127 --> 00:15:41,403
Well, then, Zoe, what were you doing on the island?

67
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:44,047
Well, nothing, really, just looking around.

68
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:48,245
- But didn't you know it was dangerous?
- No. At least not at first.

69
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:52,596
Oh, Cully, how can your conscience allow you

70
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:55,997
to expose innocent and foolish people
to such dangers?

71
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:58,760
- But I didn't take her to the island.
- Oh, nonsense.

72
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:02,681
I know all about Cully's Adventures Unlimited.

73
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:05,645
- You know, but why didn't you...
- Well, you weren't doing any harm.

74
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:07,922
- At least we thought you weren't.
- But it's illegal.

75
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:11,317
To prosecute would have given you open publicity

76
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:14,524
and it wouldn't have reflected very well on me, either.

77
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,724
I see. Why can't I be treated as an individual

78
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:20,640
and not always as the son of the Director?

79
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:25,482
Now then, young lady, tell me exactly what happened.

80
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:28,356
Well, I landed with the Doctor and Jamie.

81
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:31,166
- In Cully's ship, yes?  - Cully?

82
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:35,035
- Oh, no. We came in the Tardis.
- And what is that?

83
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,836
- It's an advanced craft for travel.
- Goes through time and space.

84
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:41,202
I think this joke has gone far enough.

85
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:42,720
There you are, I knew he wouldn't believe it.

86
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:45,082
But it's true! You can ask the Doctor and Jamie,

87
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,486
they'll be here soon.

88
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,842
What do you hope to gain by this foolishness?

89
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:52,203
But it's not. I told you when
we spoke on the vision link.

90
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:54,960
Three people have been killed,
a spacecraft has landed,

91
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,801
radioactivity has disappeared
and there are robots on that island.

92
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,798
Now, I may have a pretty inventive mind,

93
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,037
but I wouldn't have dreamt up
that lot, now, would I?

94
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,402
And no doubt you will confirm all this?

95
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:09,639
Uh, well, I haven't actually seen
the spacecraft and robots...

96
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:13,686
Oh, so it seems we only have
your word for it, Cully.

97
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:17,316
And experience has taught us
how little that can be relied upon.

98
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:19,519
What's he up to now?

99
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:23,881
He's arranging some sort of
intelligence test, Jamie.

JAMIE: You mean those wee shapes
in that big box? What for?

101
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:30,841
Yes, well, we'll have to put
the right shapes into the correct holes,

102
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:32,360
it's quite simple.

103
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:34,915
Well, if that's all it is,
a kid of two could do it.

104

Yes, that's what bothering me.
It's too simple.

- Explain it to me.
- Well, I don't know that I...

174
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:52,097
- Firepower potential?  - Huh?

175
00:20:52,187 --> 00:20:55,497
- What does it do?  - Oh! Oh, I see.

176
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,418
Well, guns kill people.

177
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:59,737
- Is that what you wanted to know?  - Fire it.

178
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:01,943
Well, I don't think...

179
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:06,225
You have to put something into it first
and it comes out here,

180
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,104
as far as I remember.

181
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,146
You. Fire it.

182
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:15,856
- Oh, I wouldn't know how...
- Do as Dominator Rago says. Fire it!

183
00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:18,586
(STAMMERING) Well, I'll try. Um...

184
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:22,023
I think you put a cork
or something in...in there...

185
00:21:22,107 --> 00:21:23,586
Jamie. Jamie, be careful.

186
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:25,339
- I'll get the hang of it, Doctor.
- Jamie, be careful.

187
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:27,657
Wait, we don't understand guns on Dulkis.

188
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:29,863
We haven't used them for hundreds of years.

189
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:32,381
So,

190
00:21:33,787 --> 00:21:38,815
you don't understand guns.

191
00:21:40,347 --> 00:21:42,178
(EXCLAIMING)

192
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,898
Are you sure?

193
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:49,945
Yes! It was the clever ones who invented them.

194
00:21:50,027 --> 00:21:52,063
- The clever ones?  - Yes, they...

195
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:55,219
They lived long ago, you see.
There aren't many of them left.

196
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:56,775
They stopped us using guns and things.

197
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:59,300
- There are two distinct types on this planet?
- Yes!

198
00:21:59,387 --> 00:22:00,900
How many of these clever ones are there?

199
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:04,775
Well, there are not many.
We don't like them much.

200
00:22:05,747 --> 00:22:08,500
- They tell us what to do, you see.  - Good.

201
00:22:09,987 --> 00:22:11,136
I see.

202
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:21,145
There is nothing to fear from these primitives,

203
00:22:21,227 --> 00:22:22,455
and the others sound as if they're pacifists.

204
00:22:22,547 --> 00:22:23,662
So they are useless.

205
00:22:23,747 --> 00:22:25,465
They have a small labour potential, nothing more.

206
00:22:25,547 --> 00:22:28,380
- Shall I destroy them?
- No, we must conserve power.

207
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:31,264
- But why do...
- We have nothing to fear from such creatures

208
00:22:31,347 --> 00:22:33,703
It will be a waste of energy to destroy them.

209
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,186
Leave them!

210
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,779
Stay away from us and the Quarks.

211
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:42,018
- Oh, yes, sir. Thank you very much.
- Yes, Master.

212
00:22:46,627 --> 00:22:48,219
(DOCTOR SIGHING)

213
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:55,865
- Am I glad that's over.
- Yeah, me, too.

214
00:22:55,947 --> 00:22:58,507
They're a bloodthirsty lot,
these Dominators, aren't they?

215
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:01,181
Aye. What do you think they're after?

216
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:02,985
I don't know.

217
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,785
That message they sent.

218
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:07,381
"Material readily accessible."

219
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:09,378
Some sort of mineral deposits, do you think?

220
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:13,858
Then this fleet of theirs would refuel,
land and pick it up. It makes sense.

221
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:16,586
What do they want the Dulcians
as slaves for? They've got the Quarks.

222
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,737
Aye, nasty little beasties.

223
00:23:19,427 --> 00:23:21,019
Hey, Doctor, they've gone.

224
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:23,798
We'd better get back to that survey place,
Zoe will be wondering what's happened to us.

225
00:23:23,887 --> 00:23:24,745
I think you're right.

226
00:23:25,627 --> 00:23:29,063
I've got to make them believe me,
before it's too late.

227
00:23:29,147 --> 00:23:31,866
- Well, what are you going to do?
- Get some evidence.

228
00:23:31,947 --> 00:23:33,266
Will you come back to the island with me?

229
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:36,225
All right. But how do we get past
the council out there?

230
00:23:36,307 --> 00:23:38,775
Through my father's rooms. Come on.

231
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:41,665
We'll have to steal a travel capsule somehow.

232
00:23:41,747 --> 00:23:44,136
Well, I can manage that all right, but...

233
00:23:44,227 --> 00:23:46,263
- Well, what's the matter?  - Your clothes.

234
00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:48,019
- Not exactly Dulcian, are they?  - So?

235
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:49,779
We'll attract too much attention.

236
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,903
We'll never get past the capsule managers.

237
00:23:51,987 --> 00:23:53,306
Still, no problem.

238
00:23:53,387 --> 00:23:55,776
We can always fix you up
with some Dulcian garments.

239
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,823
- Where from? - Clothing dispenser unit.

240
00:23:57,907 --> 00:24:00,023
There's one in my father's rooms. Come on.

241
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:02,777
This will take you direct to the capital, Doctor.

242
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:05,097
Your young friend Zoe is already there.

243
00:24:05,187 --> 00:24:08,497
And no doubt Director Senex
is awaiting your arrival now.

244
00:24:08,587 --> 00:24:10,657
- Oh, this is splendid. (CHUCKLES)
- Hey, Doctor, what is this?

245
00:24:10,747 --> 00:24:12,658
You know I hate being put in a remote...

246
00:24:15,027 --> 00:24:17,860
Now, perhaps we can get on with our work.

247
00:24:18,027 --> 00:24:21,064
QUARK: <i>Unknown creatures approaching.</i>

248
00:24:23,307 --> 00:24:25,775
-TOBA: Destroy?  - No.

249
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:28,106
Investigate.

250
00:24:28,627 --> 00:24:31,744
- It's enormous.  - So Cully was telling the truth.

251
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:33,306
- BALAN: Was he?  - TEEL: But Balan...

252
00:24:33,387 --> 00:24:35,105
Where are the robots?

253
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:36,700
Inside, perhaps?

254
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:50,060
But it's empty.

255
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:56,820
Look, there's a map of the island.

256
00:24:56,907 --> 00:24:58,784
QUARK: <i>Stand still.</i>

257
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:04,784
But you are not Dulcians!

258
00:25:09,787 --> 00:25:11,618
Where do you think everybody is?

259
00:25:15,487 --> 00:25:16,715
Destroy.

260
00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:18,675
Destroy!

261
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:21,237
(QUARKS WARBLING)

262
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:29,082
- Cully, what's happening?  - I don't know.

263
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,079
- ZOE: Oh!  - CULLY: The door. Quick!

264
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:35,638
Stuck. It's stuck.

265
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,441
We're trapped.

266
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:40,120
(ZOE SCREAMING)
