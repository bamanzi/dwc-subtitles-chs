1
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:24,683
QUARK: <i>On the orders of Dominator Toba,</i>

2
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:28,182
<i>the building was destroyed,</i>

3
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:31,464
<i>also the man Cully.</i>

4
00:31:31,547 --> 00:31:34,345
-But Jamie was in that building!
-Silence!

5
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,385
You deliberately disobeyed my order?

6
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:39,856
My life was threatened
and the Quark destroyed.

7
00:31:39,947 --> 00:31:41,426
Yes, because of your own actions.

8
00:31:41,507 --> 00:31:44,146
Are you suggesting
I should have let him escape?

9
00:31:44,227 --> 00:31:46,721
And where would he have gone?
We are on an island, Toba.

10
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:48,843
These creatures cannot escape.

11
00:31:48,927 --> 00:31:50,155
Now listen to me carefully,

12
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:52,477
and this time
you will obey my instructions.

13
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:54,603
Send these creatures back
to the central bore position.

14
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:56,040
I want it cleared, ready for drilling.

15
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:57,879
But the Quarks will do it more quickly.

16
00:31:57,967 --> 00:32:00,117
We must conserve their energy
for drilling purposes.

17
00:32:00,207 --> 00:32:01,481
You know the power levels are low.

18
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:03,355
Command accepted.
