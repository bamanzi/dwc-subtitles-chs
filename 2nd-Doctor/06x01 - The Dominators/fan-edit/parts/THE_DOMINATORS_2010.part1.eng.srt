00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:07,101
Is the local radiation completely absorbed?

3
00:01:07,187 --> 00:01:10,623
Yes, its energy's been transferred to our fuel reserves.

4
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:14,017
- But we need much more.
- Of course. That is why we are here.

5
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,825
With respect, Navigator Rago,

6
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:19,058
I still consider we should have continued to Epsilon 4.

7
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:22,344
I decided otherwise, Probationer Toba.

8
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:24,304
But this planet has never been fully surveyed.

9
00:01:24,387 --> 00:01:27,504
It's suitable for our purpose.
The planetary crust is thin here

10
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,465
and there's an intelligent form of life
suitable for a workforce.

11
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:34,335
But the natives may not be suitable for slave labour.
Suppose they're hostile?

12
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,703
- If necessary, we shall destroy them.
- Yes, destroy them.

13
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:42,497
But only if necessary!
Commence work on the preliminary survey.

14
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:43,757
Command accepted.

- Are you still feeling tired, Doctor?
- Yes, just a little bit weary, Jamie.

20
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:08,546
It's a very exhausting business

21
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:10,822
projecting all those mental images, you know.

22
00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:14,263
- You need a good rest, Doctor.
- Yes, we all do. A nice holiday.

23
00:02:14,347 --> 00:02:15,939
Where did you say this place was again?

24
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:19,417
Well, the scanner screen in the Tardis
showed it as an island of some sort

25
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,225
surrounded by a sea of mist.

26
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:25,937
Yes, it's an island on Dulkis,
a perfectly splendid planet.

27
00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:27,460
I've heard that one before.

28
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,822
And there won't be any Cybermen or Daleks, will there?

29
00:02:29,907 --> 00:02:33,377
(LAUGHS) No, no, no, of course not.
There's nothing unpleasant on Dulkis.

(STUTTERING) Oh, yes, Zoe,
the Dulcians are gentle and friendly.

35
00:03:04,347 --> 00:03:05,939
Aye, it sounded like it!

36
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:08,222
- Did the explosion cause this?
- Oh, no, no, no.

37
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:10,741
This was caused by an explosion some time ago, Jamie.

38
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:12,943
Looks like atomic blast damage to me.

39
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:16,622
Yes, I think you're right, Zoe.

40
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:19,460
But I don't understand it.

41
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:21,424
Let's look inside, shall we?

42
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:23,557
Mind the stuff here.

43
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:25,424
And you destroyed this travel ship?

44
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:27,099
You gave me no order to the contrary.

45
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:28,540
You are a probational navigator.

46
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:31,619
Your first task is to investigate. Second, assess.

47
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:34,141
You allowed your instinct for destruction

48
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:36,616
- to interfere with your primary tasks.
- Not accepted. I did...

49
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:40,416
How can you assess that which does not exist?

50
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:42,304
Have you completed your atomic analysis?

51
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:43,979
Analysis complete.

52
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:47,742
Atomic energy released on this island 17.2 decades ago.

53
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:52,336
A long time. Strange that this should be
the only trace of radiation on this planet.

54
00:03:52,427 --> 00:03:53,902
Continue.

55
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:56,899
Drilling sites have now been located and marked.

56
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,503
Then we will examine them.

57
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:01,977
Did you check the radiation level
before we left the Tardis?

58
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:06,185
That's just what I was thinking, Zoe.
I think I did.

59
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:09,821
- Yes, I'm sure I did.
- Hey, what are you two on about?

60
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:11,135
Well, I was just thinking.

61
00:04:11,227 --> 00:04:14,219
This place reminds me
of the old atom test islands on Earth.

62
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:16,775
Yes. Yes, I think you're right, Zoe.

63
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:19,745
- Test islands?  - For atomic weapons, Jamie.

64
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:22,625
But why on Dulkis?

65
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:25,505
They've outlawed war.
No, there must be some other explanation.

66
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:28,624
Well, I vote we go back to the Tardis
and find somewhere else.

67
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:29,901
Doctor!

68
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,980
TOBA: This is the eastern drilling site.

69
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:43,336
- What is that?
- Just a crude, box-like structure.

70
00:04:43,427 --> 00:04:45,543
Shall I summon the Quarks to destroy it?

71
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:47,504
Why? Will it interfere with the work?

72
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,576
No, but...

73
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:51,465
Then it would be wasteful to destroy it.

00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:58,328
- Oh, my beautiful coat is all wet.
- Ridiculous.

76
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,294
All this is totally unnecessary, you know.

77
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:02,095
There's not a trace of contamination on us.

78
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,168
Yes, so I've noticed. It's odd, isn't it?

79
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:07,135
- What's odd about it?
- Well, the whole island is radioactive.

80
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:10,653
It has been for 172 years. You must know that.

81
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:12,773
- Well, it isn't now.  - Of course it is.

82
00:05:12,857 --> 00:05:13,972
- Have you checked?  - TEEL: Well, not yet.

83
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:15,126
We've only just arrived.

84
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:17,731
But we're taking the annual readings
during the next few days.

85
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,285
Well, if I were you, I'd take them now.

86
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:22,776
Oh, my beautiful trousers.

87
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:24,736
I wasn't aware that anyone else

88
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,336
had permission to work on the island except ourselves.

89
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,328
Tell me exactly what has been happening.

90
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:32,727
But I was hoping you were going to tell us that.

91
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:34,648
This is an atom test island, isn't it?

92
00:05:34,737 --> 00:05:36,409
Oh, but of course. Everybody knows that.

93
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:37,930
Oh, well, we don't.

94
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:41,054
But atomic weapons on Dulkis?

95
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:44,209
- I thought war had been abolished here.
- It has.

96
00:05:44,297 --> 00:05:47,050
You seem to know surprisingly little
about your own planet.

97
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:50,334
Well, that's it, you see.
We've just come in the Tar...

98
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,215
Well, as Jamie was about to say,

99
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:55,731
we come from a different world, from a different time.

100
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:58,092
Not from this world? Really, that's very interesting.

101
00:05:58,177 --> 00:06:00,486
I must note that in my daily report.

102
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:01,950
Well, you don't sound very surprised.

103
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:06,010
Well, it does explain how you came to
expose yourself to the dangers on this island.

104
00:06:06,097 --> 00:06:08,327
No Dulcian would do such a foolish thing.

105
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:09,645
Well, what are you doing here, then?

106
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:12,774
We're part of Educator Balan's
expedition from the university.

107
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:17,214
But when I was here some time ago,
you were a peaceful race.

108
00:06:17,297 --> 00:06:19,492
- So you've been here before?
- Well, yes.

109
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:22,853
Ah, I must put that in my...
I'm so sorry. You were saying?

110
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:26,088
Well, what's happened to you? I thought
aggressive weapons had been abolished.

111
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:30,489
Oh, indeed they have.
The second council under Director Olvin.

112
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:32,886
He banned the manufacture of all weapons.

113
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:36,094
Then what are you doing letting off
atomic devices all over the place?

114
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:38,915
Oh! Oh, there was only one explosion.

115
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:41,615
Perhaps my pupil, Kando, should explain.

116
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:44,165
Let's see how much you remember, my dear.

117
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:46,771
- Um... Oh, yes.  - The seventh council...

118
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:49,452
The seventh council under Director Manus

119
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:53,256
initiated research which lead to
the development of atomic energy.

120
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:56,249
- The des...
- BALAN: Destructive capabilities.

121
00:06:56,337 --> 00:07:00,967
The destructive capabilities of this
were immediately apparent and...

122
00:07:01,057 --> 00:07:02,092
BALAN: This island...

123
00:07:02,177 --> 00:07:05,931
And this island was used
to test an explosive device,

124
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:08,485
the results of which can be seen today.

125
00:07:08,577 --> 00:07:12,968
Thereafter, all further research
into this type of energy was prohibited,

126
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:17,812
and the island kept as both a museum
and warning for future generations.

127
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:20,013
Oh, well, she certainly does her homework.

128
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:24,568
I see. Then this is an atomic test site?

129
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:28,696
Oh, yes. You see, students...
That was really very good, Kando.

130
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:31,655
Students are brought here
to test the radiation level

131
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:34,046
and observe the effect on the vegetation.

132
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:39,655
And of course, to see for themselves
the horrors of atomic destruction.

133
00:07:39,737 --> 00:07:43,412
- So there should be radioactivity here?
- But there isn't.

134
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:46,569
No. I wonder why?

135
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:50,295
Explain.

136
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:52,891
Part of this collection of crude weapons.

137
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:54,012
Continue.

138
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:57,453
This one operates on the early laser principle.

139
00:07:57,537 --> 00:07:59,414
Fire mechanism here.

140
00:08:03,177 --> 00:08:06,169
Self-charging power cell. Limited range.

141
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:08,646
Is this all you notice?

142
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:10,489
The other weapons are just as simple.

143
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,647
There's nothing here that could threaten us.

144
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:17,049
- These things are so old that if...
- Precisely. Old.

145
00:08:17,137 --> 00:08:20,209
At last, you casually mention a fact
of major significance.

146
00:08:20,297 --> 00:08:22,492
Has it not occurred to you,
Probationer Toba,

147
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:25,535
that other weapons
must have been developed since these?

148
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:28,336
Agreed, Navigator Rago.

149
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:32,728
DOCTOR: But why do you think
we might be responsible? Thank you.

150
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:35,411
Well, it is conceivable that your craft, the...

151
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:36,532
- Tardis.  -...Tardis,

152
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,175
could have attracted the radioactivity

153
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:40,851
in much the same way as a magnet attracts metal.

154
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,689
(CHUCKLES) Oh, it would have registered.

155
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:46,406
- Do spacecraft often land in Dulkis?
- As far as I know, you are the first.

156
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:49,216
I must say, then,
you don't seem the least bit surprised.

157
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:51,174
We are taught to accept fact,

158
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:54,852
it being foolish to contemplate fantasy
in the face of reality.

159
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:57,656
You are here. This is fact.

160
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,932
That you come from another planet I accept,

161
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:02,053
because I have no other means of proving it.

162
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:04,048
- TEEL: Not a sign of radiation.
- BALAN: There.

163
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:05,411
But look what I found.

164
00:09:05,497 --> 00:09:07,294
- Cully, what are you...
- Never mind that now.

165
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:08,651
We've got to get back to the capital.

166
00:09:08,737 --> 00:09:10,967
Oh, it's impossible.
We haven't even begun our survey yet.

167
00:09:11,057 --> 00:09:12,285
Well, if you don't, you'll be wiped out.

168
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:14,732
He claims to have seen robots and spacecraft.

169
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:17,490
- You didn't tell me you brought robots.
- I haven't.

170
00:09:17,577 --> 00:09:19,852
Look, I brought three people here in my ship.

171
00:09:19,937 --> 00:09:21,814
They've been killed by those creatures.
So if you don't...

172
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:22,932
(LAUGHING)

173
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:25,611
- ZOE: What's so funny?
- Now, I see. Ajest.

174
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:28,416
Three people. So you come
from another world, do you, Doctor?

175
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:30,010
- Hey, I don't think...
- Really, Cully,

176
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:32,975
you and your friends might at least
have agreed upon the same story.

177
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:36,811
What? But these aren't my three, you old...

178
00:09:36,897 --> 00:09:37,886
Oh, what's the use?

179
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,251
- JAMIE: What was he talking about?
- I don't know.

180
00:09:39,337 --> 00:09:41,726
Look, I've never seen
this gentleman before in my life.

181
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:44,411
Cully, you had no right to bring
these people here without permission,

182
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:47,011
even if you are the son
of the director of the council.

183
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:48,416
Well, go on, then.
Why don't you call him up?

184
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:51,375
At least he's not as stupid as you are.

185
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,608
- You say you've seen a spacecraft?
- I've told you, haven't I?

186
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:56,528
And robots. Well, at least I think
they were robots.

187
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:58,573
What exactly did this spacecraft look like?

188
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:01,376
Well, it's large and circular
and a sort of silvery colour.

189
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:03,209
That means it can't be the Tardis.

190
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:05,970
Are you sure it wasn't square,
like a large wooden box?

191
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:07,888
No, no, that's not the spacecraft.

192
00:10:07,977 --> 00:10:11,413
No, the box is where
those aliens have made a sort of mark,

193
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:12,646
a five-pointed star.

194
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,331
They were examining it just now.
Talking about destroying it.

195
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,486
- What?  - What?

196
00:10:16,577 --> 00:10:17,805
- Jamie, we better go and see.
- Come on.

197
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:19,012
You're wasting your time.

198
00:10:19,097 --> 00:10:20,849
I prefer to make up my own mind, thank you.

199
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:22,655
Jamie. Are you coming, Zoe?

200
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:24,329
- No, I think I'll stay here.  - Right.

201
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:25,985
- Come on, then.
- We shan't be a minute.

202
00:10:26,537 --> 00:10:29,370
Commence work on preparing the sites
of the outer bore hole.

203
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:32,290
- At once, Navigator Rago.
- Send this message to Fleet Leader.

204
00:10:32,377 --> 00:10:34,572
"Materials located. Detailed report follows."

205
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:36,409
Command accepted.

206
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:39,570
JAMIE: At least they haven't harmed the Tardis.

207
00:10:39,657 --> 00:10:40,806
DOCTOR: That's a relief.

208
00:10:40,897 --> 00:10:42,489
Jamie, come and have a look at this.
It's interesting.

209
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:43,771
- Look. See. - What?

210
00:10:43,857 --> 00:10:44,926
What's so interesting about that?

211
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:47,292
Well, I think it must be
some sort of survey mark.

212
00:10:47,377 --> 00:10:48,890
Very likely.

213
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:50,569
Jamie, look.

214
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,412
- Some sort of tracks.  - So they are.

215
00:10:57,137 --> 00:10:59,207
We'll follow them, shall we?

216
00:11:13,737 --> 00:11:15,932
Oh, look, I think we'd better get back.

217
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:18,406
Zoe will be wondering what's happening...

218
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:21,933
Well, this is interesting. Yes.

219
00:11:22,017 --> 00:11:27,933
Obviously an interstellar spaceship
of considerably advanced design.

220
00:11:29,217 --> 00:11:32,095
Oh, no. You're not thinking
what I think you're thinking, are you?

221
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:34,930
That, I think, Jamie, depends
on what you think I am thinking.

222
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:36,530
Oh.

223
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:38,653
- Hey, Doctor. - Stop that, Jamie.

224
00:11:38,737 --> 00:11:39,886
- Doctor. - Jamie, don't do it.

225
00:11:39,977 --> 00:11:42,172
- Doctor, look. Look.  - Oh, my word.

226
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:46,455
QUARK: <i>Do not move. Do not move.</i>

227
00:11:46,537 --> 00:11:48,846
<i>Next task?</i>

228
00:11:48,937 --> 00:11:51,497
<i>Shall we destroy?</i>

229
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,807
<i>Shall we destroy?</i>
