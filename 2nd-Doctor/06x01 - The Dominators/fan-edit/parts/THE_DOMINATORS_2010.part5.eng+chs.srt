the crust of the planet is thin.

I might be able to defuse it.
我还是有可能拆除它的

down the centre hole,

All we've got to do is dig a tunnel
through from here to the borehole
我们要做的事情, 就是挖一条隧道, 从这里到那个矿洞

126
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:22,205
and catch the seed device thing on its way down!
在那个设备下来的时候把它接住！

00:38:22,287 --> 00:38:24,596
Oh. Well, it was just an idea.
噢, 但是, 这只是一个想法

We can get the direction from the periscope.
我们可以从潜望镜里面看好方向

133
00:38:37,087 --> 00:38:38,725
Just line it up with the drilling site.
往钻孔点画一条线

134
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:42,322
Yes, there's only one snag, though.
Could we complete the tunnel in time?
是的．但还是有一个问题：我们能及时挖通隧道吗？

135
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:43,999
It'd have to be 12 feet long or more.
至少得有１２英尺

136
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:46,317
Well, Cully and I could delay
the Dominators' work up there.
这样, Cully 和我可以在上面拖延统领者的工作

137
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,442

怎么拖延？

138
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:50,121
Oh, we're getting very good
at destroying Quarks, aren't we?
噢, 我们很擅长消灭那些夸克, 对吧？

139
00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:51,606
Yes, certainly seems to stop them working.
对, 至少让它们停止工作没有问题

140
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:53,882
DOCTOR: Yes, that's true,
but you've been lucky so far.
是, 你说得对．但到目前位置你们只是幸运

141
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,481
If only I could devise some sort of weapon for you.
要是我能帮你们设计出某种武器就好了

142
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,364
- Is there anything down here, Cully?
