00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:12,506
Isn't it beautiful!
是不是很漂亮？

2
00:43:12,627 --> 00:43:15,380
- Oh, my word. What a wonderful sight!
- Fantastic!
- 噢，天啊，多美的景象!  - 壮观！

3
00:43:15,547 --> 00:43:18,081
Listen, will you two stop gaping at that
and get us out of here.
嘿，你俩能不能别感慨了，带我们离开这里

4
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:19,581
Don't worry, Jamie. We're safe in the Tardis.
别担心, Jamie, 我们在 TARDIS 里面很安全

5
00:43:19,677 --> 00:43:24,620
Are you sure? Has the Tardis
ever been buried in lava before?
你确定吗？ TARDIS 被岩浆掩埋过没有？

6
00:43:24,787 --> 00:43:27,365
- No.
- How can you be so sure we're going to be all right?
- 没有  - 那你怎么能这么肯定我们会没事？

Oh, dear.

8
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:33,544
- Is something wrong?
- This has happened before.
- 有什么不对劲吗？  - 这事儿以前也出现过

9
00:43:33,707 --> 00:43:36,983
The fluid links aren't able to take the load. Oh!
流体连接器不工作了．噢！

10
00:43:37,547 --> 00:43:39,456
(ZOE) Mercury vapour!
水银蒸汽！

11
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:43,297
Oh! This darn thing's stuck! Of all the stupid, idiotic!
噢！这个破玩意儿卡住了！最愚蠢、傻蛋！

12
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:47,377
- Doctor, The lava's up to the Tardis!
- (ZOE) Doctor
- 博士, 熔岩都快到 TARDIS 了!  - 博士

13
00:43:47,807 --> 00:43:52,604
If only I could unstick this stupid, idiotic...
There we are.
只要我能挪动这个愚蠢、傻蛋的...这下好了

14
00:43:52,704 --> 00:43:54,212
Have you done it? Are we on our way? 
你搞定了吗？我们上路了？

15
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:58,238
It's stopped the fluid links from vaporising.
We shan't suffocate.
流体连接器停止蒸发了。我们不会窒息了

16
00:43:58,407 --> 00:44:01,639
If we don't hurry, we'll be fried by the lava.
如果我们不快点, 就会被熔岩烧成灰了

17
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:06,676
- Isn't there any way we can get away?
- Well, there IS an emergency unit, but...
- 我们有什么可能逃脱吗？  - 唔, 是有一个紧急设备, 但是...

18
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:10,237
- I can't possibly use that.
- But this IS an emergency!
- 我不能启用那个  - 但是这就是紧急情况啊

19
00:44:10,407 --> 00:44:14,844
But it moves the Tardis out of the 
time-space dimension, out of reality!
但它会把 TARDIS 移出时空维度, 推到现实之外去！

20
00:44:15,007 --> 00:44:18,317
Fine. Reality's getting too hot, anyway!
很好．反正现实已经太热了！

21
00:44:19,487 --> 00:44:21,876
Oh, all right.
噢, 好吧

22
00:44:24,687 --> 00:44:26,678
Here we are.
来看看

23
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:28,838
Now, then, which end was...?
喏, 哪头是...

24
00:44:29,007 --> 00:44:30,679
Yes...
对了

25
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:34,522
I can't possibly use this.
We don't know what will happen.
我不能启用这个, 我们不知道可能发生什么!

26
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,963
Stop your jabbering and get on with it. Look!
别叨叨了, 赶紧动手吧．看！
