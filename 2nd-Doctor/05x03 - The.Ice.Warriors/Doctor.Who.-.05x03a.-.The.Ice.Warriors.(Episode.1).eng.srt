1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:08,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:01:20,603 --> 00:01:31,781
This is a preliminary warning. Preliminary warning. Prepare
phase one base evacuation procedure. Phase one evacuation.

3
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,301
...determine the extent of
breakdown factor in ionisation...

4
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:37,875
Why has the ioniser been allowed
to deteriorate to danger level?

5
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,630
There was a power stoppage.
I've done all I can to boost it.

6
00:01:40,777 --> 00:01:42,523
Well it can't be allowed
to fall any lower.

7
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:43,947
We still have time to evacuate.

8
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:47,669
We will certainly not evacuate.
We've beaten its tantrums before.

9
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:49,325
It's falling again.

10
00:01:49,463 --> 00:01:50,886
Well hold it... steady

11
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:52,056
I can't.

12
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,115
Switch the stabilising circuits
through to the computer.

13
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:55,705
I have, it's still not holding!

14
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:57,481
All circuits, woman, all circuits!

15
00:01:57,632 --> 00:01:58,543
We're nearly there.

16
00:01:58,674 --> 00:01:59,977
There's not enough power.

17
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:02,072
It's slowing down.

18
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:05,258
Maybe it'll hold there.

19
00:02:05,612 --> 00:02:06,257
I doubt it.

20
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:09,740
Well, at least it gives us time.

21
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:12,211
We need Scientist Penley.

22
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:18,056
He is no longer a member of this
post. You will make this machine work.

23
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:21,952
Yes, Leader Clent.

24
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:23,831
That's better.

25
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:25,707
Emergency evacuation phasing set?

26
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,163
Yes.

27
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,840
loniser state fault check?

28
00:02:29,387 --> 00:02:30,171
Yes.

29
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:33,458
Reactor safety sequence
in operation. Good.

30
00:02:33,684 --> 00:02:36,406
You'll make an organiser
first class yet, Miss Garrett.

31
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:39,144
I only follow your
example, Leader Clent.

32
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:46,544
What is the latest report
from all other ioniser bases?

33
00:02:47,288 --> 00:03:01,548
All bases are in phase. America: glaciers held. Australasia: glaciers
held. South Africa: glaciers held. Asia: some improvement claimed.

34
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:02,463
They would!

35
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:09,297
Britannicus Base, Europe: slipping
out of phase. Glacial advance imminent.

36
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,004
If we fail, the whole program for
glacier containment is in danger.

37
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:16,463
I'm fully aware of that fact.

38
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,397
But in two hours, the
ioniser will be useless.

39
00:03:19,703 --> 00:03:27,818
And then the glaciers will move again... 5000 years
of history... crushed beneath a moving mountain of ice.

40
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:31,873
Phase two evacuation. Emergency. Phase two
evacuation. Red state emergency. Red state emergency.

41
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:32,674
Priority override.

42
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,790
Yes, of course. But
Penley was the expert.

43
00:03:35,964 --> 00:03:41,537
I've had enough of experts.
Their crazy ideas. Where's Arden?

44
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,045
Still at the ice face, completing
the instrumentation project.

45
00:03:44,955 --> 00:03:46,169
Well, hasn't he been warned?

46
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:47,285
We couldn't get through...

47
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:52,147
Well we have to tell him, immediately!
I cannot lose any more men!

48
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,568
Leader Clent to Scientist Arden
at glacier face, come in Arden!

49
00:03:55,808 --> 00:04:03,709
Walters, through here. Now clear that...

50
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,431
Sir. Get your drill ready, Davis.

51
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:11,272
Sir!

52
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:12,232
Yes?

53
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:13,725
Come quickly, Sir!

54
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,584
I could swear there's something inside.

55
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,571
Oh, not another mastodon.

56
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,573
Well look for yourself, Sir.

57
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:27,043
Is it a man?

58
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:28,202
Perhaps it's an animal.

59
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:30,434
Well we'll soon find out.
Davis, the heavy drill.

60
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,206
Yes Sir.

61
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,692
Base calling, Sir.

62
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:33,696
What do they want?

63
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,802
There's nothing coming through. Poor
reception. I suppose they might...

64
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,619
They'll have to wait. This is
more important. Come on Davis.

65
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:40,843
Well what are we going to do, Sir?

66
00:04:40,977 --> 00:04:44,481
Do? Excavate. This could
be a brilliant discovery.

67
00:04:44,612 --> 00:04:47,429
But Sir
- the computerised schedule! We must stick to that.

68
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,764
Oh, must we?

69
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:51,689
Leader Clent will be furious, Sir.

70
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:55,478
Well that's just too bad. For once we'll
do something on our own account, eh?

71
00:04:55,667 --> 00:05:01,737
There's not much base can do about it Sir,
after all, we can't even ask permission, can we?

72
00:05:01,877 --> 00:05:03,546
Come on Davis, hurry man!

73
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:15,225
Arden, for heavens sake
man, come in! This is urgent!

74
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:30,141
_ again. _ is decreasing. Not
far from total disintegration.

75
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:56,300
Arrgh!

76
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:15,916
What's the matter?

77
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,239
You're on my head!

78
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:20,406
Careful!

79
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,015
Come on, Victoria. Give me your hand.

80
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:35,953
It was a blind landing.

81
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:37,137
Is that what you call it?

82
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:42,530
Well no broken bones.
Hey, look at the snow.

83
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,009
Oh no, not again! Tibet was bad enough, but I think
you've put us down just further up the mountain!

84
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:58,488
Well let's see, shall we? Very careful, I'm
going to get out. It's quite a long drop.

85
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:04,794
Come on Victoria, that's right.

86
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:10,709
Hey, looks like a great
big wall of ice. Look!

87
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,090
Ooohhh!

88
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,205
What is it?

89
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,167
You're on my hand!

90
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,388
But Doctor, look.

91
00:07:19,222 --> 00:07:21,542
Yes, that's not ice, that's plastic.

92
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:25,520
Yes and, see how smooth
it is, and curved.

93
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:29,447
It's a dome. A protective dome.

94
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:33,354
It's so big. Can't see the end
of it. Wonder what's inside.

95
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,802
Don't worry, those alarms weren't meant
for us. I wonder what's wrong, though.

96
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,379
Ach, that's their problem. Come on.

97
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,812
Leader Clent! The video!
Arden has made contact.

98
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:33,600
Arden! Can you hear me?

99
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:34,734
Yes. What is it?

100
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,186
You must return to base immediately.

101
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:40,853
Well don't panic. I've almost finished setting
up the seismograph probe. Davis hurry up.

102
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,515
Well... the ioniser's nearly
at disintegration point.

103
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,415
Oooh, I wonder if
Penley's ears are burning.

104
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:48,534
It's not a laughing matter,
man! You know what it means.

105
00:08:48,657 --> 00:08:51,792
Yes, cold weather ahead. I
thought it felt a bit nippy.

106
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,075
There'll be a full enquiry into
your delay, you realise that.

107
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:59,083
Yes, and I've got a very good reason.
A fantastic discovery, in the ice.

108
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,076
Your task was to set up movement probes in
the ice, not indulge in amateur archaeology.

109
00:09:03,246 --> 00:09:04,570
This is a man!

110
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:08,491
Well, congratulations. Makes a change
from fossils. Now leave it and return.

111
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,124
I'm bringing the body back with me.

112
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,881
Arden.

113
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:13,243
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
There seems to some interference.

114
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,195
Arden!

115
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,595
Oh, Doctor, it's just like my home.

116
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:24,547
I know!

117
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:34,383
Red state emergency. Evacuation phase three. Phase three evacuate.
Transport section leaders report now. Phase three evacuation.

118
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:35,192
Something's wrong.

119
00:09:35,781 --> 00:09:36,390
Seems safe enough.

120
00:09:43,196 --> 00:09:44,218
Oh, thank you.

121
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:53,110
Thank you. Excuse me Miss, I'm Jamie McCrimmon,
do you think you could tell us where we are?

122
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:54,573
She doesn't want to know, Jamie.

123
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,185
Hey, this says we're on
evacuation flight seven.

124
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,287
Yes, rather inhospitable,
we've only just arrived!

125
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:00,161
Mmm.

126
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:02,533
Hey, and this tag, it
says I'm a scavenger!

127
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:05,160
And yours does too!
Hey, we're not beggars!

128
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:06,258
Hush Jamie.

129
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:07,450
What is it Doctor?

130
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:14,723
Sounds like electronic machinery, like a
computer. There's something wrong with it's pitch.

131
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:18,607
Oh no. Now look, it might be
dangerous, now let's leave it.

132
00:10:18,964 --> 00:10:19,674
No.

133
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:20,698
Doctor.

134
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:22,429
Let's go in.

135
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,620
Oh, there's something very wrong here.

136
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:32,307
Now is _ still out of phase?...
Seven-two point four...

137
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,829
Seven-two point four? That's bad.

138
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:38,654
Now balance those gauges, Miss
Henry. 17 degrees out from normal.

139
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:40,717
17 degrees? Well this is serious!

140
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,088
One-three-seven-nine,
now...

142
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,623
Who the blazes are you? Get
these scavengers out of here!

143
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,778
We're not scavengers!

144
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:55,393
Out of here!

145
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:03,652
No! In two minutes 38 seconds, you're going to
have an almighty explosion! The readings say so!

146
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:08,937
Well how do you possibly know that, I haven't even, I
haven't even processed them through the computer yet!

147
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,988
I don't need a computer!

148
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:13,122
If he's right it's
already too late to escape!

149
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:15,173
No it isn't, it doesn't have
to happen, if you'll excuse me.

150
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:19,091
Cut out the reactor!

151
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,093
There's insufficient power for that.

152
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:26,928
Well a quick short burst then
from the reactor unit, now.

153
00:11:27,842 --> 00:11:28,522
Off!

154
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,450
Now link the circuit,
with the reactor link.

155
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:35,760
Now, bring in the computer stabiliser.

156
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:49,843
Yes, yes, that should hold it steady. It's a, it's not a
perfect job, mind you. You ought to get an expert in, you know.

157
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:56,460
How did you... It was all bluff, wasn't
it, that two minutes 38 seconds to danger?

158
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:59,419
Oh no, it was near enough
correct, give or take a second.

159
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:00,660
Rubbish.

160
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:04,041
Check it on your
precious computer, then.

161
00:12:05,105 --> 00:12:06,458
Miss Garrett, do so.

162
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:19,249
loniser fall rate: seven-two point four, ion compensator: minus
one-seven degrees, ion flow rate: one-three-seven-nine. Assessment please.

163
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:27,776
Immediate emergency. In two minutes
37 seconds, the reactor will explode.

164
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,441
Well a second out. We...
can't all be perfect.

165
00:12:31,304 --> 00:12:33,244
We're at half power now, Leader Clent!

166
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:36,645
Why even Penley couldn't have done
better. Where on earth did you spring from?

167
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:37,824
It doesn't matter, look...

168
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,266
Are you alright?

169
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:49,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no no no no. It's nothing, it's
just um, it's just an emergency _ and 10 hour duty spell.

170
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,587
The vibro-chair.

171
00:12:51,748 --> 00:13:00,804
Yes, you're right. Um, contact the Medi-Control Centre the moment
there's a further _ We'll talk at the same time, come with me.

172
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:04,833
Ask him where we are!

173
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:07,866
A giant among prehistoric men.

174
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,400
See the kind of armour he's got on?

175
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:21,783
Yes, that's rather strange. He looks pre-Viking. But no such
civilisation existed in prehistoric times before the first ice age.

176
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:27,330
Ha! Proper "Ice Warrior", isn't he, Sir?
I reckon Leader Clent will be interested.

177
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:31,692
Yes. What'll the mighty
computer make of it, eh?

178
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:34,813
Sir, hadn't we better get back
while the weather still holds?

179
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:39,185
Good point Walters. Davis, try bringing
the air-sled a little closer, will you?

180
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:48,644
What are they up to?

181
00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:56,338
Arden's found something in the ice. Something
to take back to Clent. It won't be appreciated.

182
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,497
Ar, they ought to leave way alone.

183
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:01,962
Arden was always a researcher. He wanted
to be an archaeologist when I knew him.

184
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:04,452
Archaeology. What good's that?

185
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:06,845
It's good to know things,
even when they're dead.

186
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:09,215
Nothing's sacred to you, is it?

187
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:12,348
I only ask questions, it's
in my character I suppose.

188
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,663
Ar, you swore you'd give all that up.

189
00:14:15,398 --> 00:14:25,044
Discovery's as exciting to me as the hunt is to you. But with Clent,
he uses scientists' craniums as stepping stones for his ambitions.

190
00:14:25,254 --> 00:14:27,420
Ar, that's about all
you lot are fit for...

191
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:30,039
Well we're not totally useless, surely?

192
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:35,545
To me you are. Come on, we've got to
move. Leave them to... stupid games.

193
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:01,009
Avalanche! Come on!

194
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:01,925
Where's Davis?

195
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:05,681
Storr! Come on! Avalanche!

196
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:21,900
Storr, are you alright?

197
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:22,757
Penley...

198
00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:23,771
What's the damage?

199
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:28,773
My arm. It's gone I think.

200
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:29,791
Broken?

201
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:31,421
Feels like it.

202
00:15:31,617 --> 00:15:35,181
Well you're lucky. There's one down there
who's staying on the mountain for good.

203
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:43,872
They'll... they'll come looking for him. We must move out a
bit. Unless you fancy trying to turn me over to your friends.

204
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:47,860
Six weeks ago they were my friends,
but not anymore. Can you walk?

205
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:52,074
Aye. Just you try and keep up. Come on.

206
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,244
All clear, Sir.

207
00:15:55,464 --> 00:15:56,625
Yes, but how 'bout Davis?

208
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,687
I'll go look for him.

209
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,340
Well let's hope he's safe. With another
man gone, Clent'll skin me alive.

210
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:05,977
Well if he gets too difficult, you can
always set your warrior on him, eh Sir?

211
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,524
But you've no valid proof
of your qualifications?

212
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:11,898
Look, aren't we wasting time?

213
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:15,447
If you want our help, why
not tell us all about it?

214
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:19,056
All about it? All about what?
Where have you been all these years?

215
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:28,020
Well, er, as a matter of fact, we've, we've been
in retreat. In, in Tibet. We are sanctifiers.

216
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:38,354
Oh, I see. In Tibet. Well if you'll take a simple test,
I'll soon know if you're up to our scientific standards.

217
00:16:38,526 --> 00:16:41,046
I see, and er, if I fail?

218
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:44,778
You'll be evacuated with the
other scavengers in due course.

219
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:46,039
Oh, where to?

220
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:48,527
The African rehabilitation
centres, of course.

221
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:50,317
Oh no, not Africa.

222
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,022
Very well, fire away.

223
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,649
I present you a problem.

224
00:16:55,842 --> 00:16:56,493
Yes.

225
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,263
All the major continents are threatened with
destruction, under the glaciers of the second ice age.

226
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,300
Oh.

227
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:09,053
How would you halt the ice surge, and turn the climate
back to normal? 45 seconds, starting from... now.

228
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:15,071
Oh, er, ahem, er, possible causes,
er, the reversal of the magnetic field.

229
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:16,816
No such change has occurred.

230
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:21,245
Um, interstellar clouds,
er, obscuring the suns rays.

231
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:26,222
An excessive burst of sunspot activity.

232
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:32,819
A severe shift of the
Earth's angle of rotation.

233
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:34,609
Come on Doctor.

234
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:39,073
There aren't that many alternatives.
Gigantic heat loss, eh? Er.

235
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:43,384
I asked for an answer, not a
question. Twelve seconds left.

236
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:51,969
Oh. Er. Oh well. Ahem. In that case the answer's simple. A severe drop
in the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's lower atmosphere. Is that it?

237
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:55,526
I would use ionisation.

238
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:58,063
Well, is he right?

239
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,382
Yes, he is.

240
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:03,292
But I still don't understand.

241
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:11,136
Well the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's atmosphere helps retain
the suns heat. Take that gas away, and there's a sudden freeze up.

242
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:12,879
Oh, where does the gas go to?

243
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:13,670
Well...

244
00:18:13,872 --> 00:18:29,209
You know how efficient our civilisation is, thanks to the direction of the great world computer. And you also know how we conquered the problem of world famine a
century ago by artificial food. On the land that was once used to grow the food we needed, we built up-to-date living units, to house the ever-increasing population.

245
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:30,657
Up to date?

246
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:42,137
Well there were exceptions, of course. I mean this house was classified as being historic
interest. So, the amount of growing plants on the planet, was reduced to an absolute minimum.

247
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:44,835
No plants, no carbon dioxide.

248
00:18:45,264 --> 00:18:49,317
Then suddenly, one year,
there was no spring.

249
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,549
Even then it wasn't understood. Not
until the ice-caps began to advance.

250
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,964
Er, but er, what's this ioniser?

251
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:03,903
Um, Miss Garrett.

252
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:11,120
lonisation is a method of intensifying the suns
heat onto the Earth, but into particular areas.

253
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:14,330
Yeah, it's like a
magnifying glass, Jamie.

254
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:15,600
Oh, aye.

255
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,965
You mean you can melt glaciers
and change the weather?

256
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:21,531
Um, when certain
difficulties are overcome.

257
00:19:21,782 --> 00:19:23,874
Precise control is not easy.

258
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:29,067
We can't afford to make mistakes. lonisation can
produce temperatures intense enough to melt rock.

259
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,869
Only by maintaining a perfect balance
can we prevent widespread flooding.

260
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:36,114
Can't your computers solve
the problem of control?

261
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,850
Of course they can!

262
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:39,001
Well?

263
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,132
When the input data is complete
they will give us the solution.

264
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:44,041
Oh, I see. And when will that be?

265
00:19:44,204 --> 00:19:45,911
Soon Doctor, soon.

266
00:19:46,196 --> 00:19:47,662
What's the position now?

267
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:53,741
Well we're barely holding the glacier in check. Now
there you see a world map of the situation at the moment.

268
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:11,098
And there you see what's, erm, going on in our sector. But if we fail, then not only will Europe be
swallowed up, but the balance of power will be ruined, and the whole world program will, will go under.

269
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:12,511
And the glaciers will win.

270
00:20:14,508 --> 00:20:23,924
My senior scientist Penley, is missing. I think you have the
capabilities to join us here. This great mission. Will you help us?

271
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:26,109
Well I, I'm willing to try.

272
00:20:26,784 --> 00:20:33,052
Jolly good. Jolly good. Er, Miss Garrett will give you some
background information. You've worked with computers, I presume?

273
00:20:33,217 --> 00:20:34,546
Er, only when I have to.

274
00:20:34,695 --> 00:20:37,058
Well Miss Garrett is our computer
specialist, she'll help you.

275
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:39,021
Oh, I'll try and remember that.

276
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:41,557
Here we are completely computerised.

277
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:43,049
Oh never mind.

278
00:20:43,338 --> 00:20:51,629
Every decision is checked, to eliminate risk of failure. Because of
course, all decisions, all actions, must conform to the common good.

279
00:20:53,894 --> 00:20:56,542
This way, gentlemen, this way. Right.

280
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:07,709
Now do be careful. 'Round
here. Steady with her.

281
00:21:12,115 --> 00:21:16,822
Is this... your full co-operation, Arden?
How do you expect us to carry out this...

282
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:19,795
Great heavens.

283
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:23,121
Yes, I thought you'd be impressed Clent.
Right chaps, lets have him over here...

284
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,186
This way, this way...

285
00:21:29,816 --> 00:21:30,600
What is it?

286
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,899
It looks like a Viking
warrior. Look at the helmet.

287
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:39,338
Frozen for centuries in the ice.
Perfectly preserved. Hm, that's odd though.

288
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,644
What? Who are you?

289
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,648
An addition to our staff,
Arden. What's odd Doctor?

290
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:48,052
Well the helmet, it's wrong. When this man was
frozen to death only primitive cavemen existed.

291
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:52,186
Well I say it's an undiscovered
civilisation. Think of the implications!

292
00:21:52,462 --> 00:21:59,984
Well whatever the implications, it must still take second place to out ioniser project.
We have our daily planning conference in three minutes fifteen seconds, exactly.

293
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:04,755
Come along Arden! Play with
your toy after the meeting.

294
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:10,630
Well, what's supposed to happen, Doctor?

295
00:22:11,072 --> 00:22:15,359
You see this fellow Arden has set the electricity so that
the ice melts very slowly, allowing for the resistance.

296
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:16,782
It's working quite quickly.

297
00:22:16,978 --> 00:22:19,819
Well, I suspect there are some
impurities in the ice. I say.

298
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:25,383
Look at that.

299
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,827
What is it?

300
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:32,064
It's an electronic
connection. I'm sure of it.

301
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:33,631
It can't be.

302
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:40,350
Now you wait here, and,
and don't touch anything.

303
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,717
What's got into him all of a sudden?

304
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:48,716
I don't know. Scientists are
all alike, eureka and all that.

305
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:50,559
Aye. Could do with a go on this, maybe.

306
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:55,123
Er, Victoria.

307
00:22:55,404 --> 00:22:56,149
What?

308
00:22:56,616 --> 00:22:58,568
You see how those lassies were dressed?

309
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:02,693
Yes I did. And trust you to
think of something like that.

310
00:23:03,222 --> 00:23:04,793
What? Couldn't help thinking about it.

311
00:23:04,995 --> 00:23:08,444
Well I think it's disgusting,
wearing that kind of thing.

312
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:14,845
Oh, aye, so it is, so it is. You er, you
don't see yourself dressed like that then?

313
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:15,643
Jamie!

314
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:17,849
Oh, I'm sorry, it was just an idea.

315
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:22,043
We will now change the subject,
please. I want to look at this man.
