Who are you?
你是谁？

8
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,694
I never answer questions until I'm properly introduced.
如果不先问侯我的话, 我不回答任何问题

9
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:15,249
You will answer now.
你现在就要回答

10
00:01:17,419 --> 00:01:35,887
Very well. You are standing in the airlock to this spacecraft.
Unless you answer my questions within ten seconds, I will take the atmospheric pressure around you down to zero.
很好, 你正站在飞船的减压舱
如果你不回答我的问题, 在10秒钟之内我就将你那里的空气压力降到0

11
00:01:36,212 --> 00:01:38,308
But... but if you do that my body will explode!
如果那样的话我的身体会爆掉的

12
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:47,816
One... two... three...
一．．．二．．．三．．．

13
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:52,391
Oh alright! Alright! But I don't think much of your hospitality!
好吧, 好吧！但我认为你实在不怎么好客

14
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:57,959
Identify yourself.
亮明你的身份

15
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,074
Me? I... I'm a scientist. I've come to talk with you.
我？ 我．．．我是一个科学家．我是在找你们谈话的

16
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:05,191
To help you.
来帮助你们

17
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,632
A scientist?
一个科学家？

18
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:11,066
Yes, yes you could call me that.
是, 是的你可以这么称呼我

19
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:14,288
You do not look like a scientist.
你看起来并不像一个科学家

20
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:15,959
Well looks aren't everything you know!
哦, 看来你并不是什么都懂

21
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:23,511
You look more like a scavenger. We killed him.
你看起来像是一个流浪汉, 我们刚杀死了一个

22
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:27,850
Well if you kill me, you'll ruin any chance you may have of escape.
如果你们杀死我, 你就毁掉了逃走的机会了

23
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:31,411
Do you think he can help us?
你觉得他可能帮助我们吗？

24
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:38,913
He cannot afford to lie. Allow him to enter.
他不敢撒谎．让他进来

25
00:02:40,936 --> 00:02:43,132
Ah, thank you very much, that's very civil of you.
啊, 非常感谢, 这样就有礼貌多了

26
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:44,254
Oh, my word!


27
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:46,245
You claim to be able to help us.
你宣称说能够帮助我们

28
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:57,195
No... I am sure I can help you. On certain conditions.
不．．．我确信我能帮助你们, 在某种条件

29
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:02,832
You are our prisoner. It is we who set conditions.
你是我们的囚犯, 由我们定条件

30
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:10,807
On the contrary, it is you who are the prisoner, and I can help you!
恰恰相反, 你们才是囚犯．我能帮助你们

31
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:24,468
Not on your terms. Bring in the girl.
Now we will have two hostages.
不是按你的条件．带那个女孩儿过来．
现在我们有两个人质了

32
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:32,386
Well what good will that do? You are buried alive in the heart of this glacier.
Time is desperately short! You've got no time to bargain over hostages.
你这么做有什么好处? 你们被困在冰山的中间, 快被活埋了
已经迫在眉睫了, 你没有时间讨价还价

33
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:44,070
Inside our spaceship, we are safe.
And with you here, your base will dare not use their secret weapon against us.
在我们飞船里面, 我们是安全的
加上你也在这里, 你们的基地不敢使用他们的神秘武器来对付我们

34
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:49,074
Weapon? But, but the ioniser is not a weapon!
武器？ 但是, 那个离子器不是武器！

35
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:50,617
You know how it works?
你知道他是怎么工作的？

36
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:54,490
Yes of course! It'll melt the ice and set you free!
当然知道, 那是用来融化冰川的, 只会把你们放出去

37
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:56,889
You're hurting me!
你伤到我了

38
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:58,030
Victoria!

39
00:03:58,224 --> 00:03:59,108
Oh Doctor!
喔, 博士

40
00:03:59,361 --> 00:04:01,005
Victoria.

41
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:04,457
Oh dear but they've got you too.
哦, 天啊他们把你也抓住了

42
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:06,880
It's alright. We are not beaten yet.
没事的, 我们还没被打倒

43
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:08,370
Jamie...
Jamie 呢？

44
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:09,662
He's alive!
他还活着

45
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:16,052
If what you say is true, why have you not freed us before?
如果你说的是真的, 为什么之前没有给我们自由？

46
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:20,219
Well, there are difficulties.
哦, 这里有些困难

47
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:21,722
What are they?
什么困难

48
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,507
Well...
这个．．．

49
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:26,282
You will tell us.
你得告诉我们

50
00:05:04,282 --> 00:05:10,613
...Well it's not... it's not much farther now, lad.
．．．这个, 不是．．．不太太远了, 小子

51
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:12,018
How far are we?
还有多远

52
00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:16,473
Well, we're at the edge of the woods fringing the camp perimeter.
我们在林子边缘了, 前面就是基地的营地了

53
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:18,070
Can we not rest a while?
我们不能歇一下吗？

54
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:22,111
I think so - but a couple of minutes, no more.
我觉得可以 - 不过就几分钟, 不能太长

55
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:24,424
Aye, you're right. The Doctor needs help right away.
啊, 你说得对, 博士现在正需要帮助呢

56
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:26,562
I wasn't thinking only of the Doctor.
我考虑的不仅仅是博士

57
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:30,602
Wolves!
有狼！

58
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:36,546
Yes. Here we're more or less safe, but the last stretch is open country.
是的, 但我们这里还算是安全的, 但(fixme)

59
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,495
I don't help much, do I?
恐怕我帮不上忙了, 是吧

60
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:44,686
Well I'm not exactly a man of action myself. Storr should be here now, I miss him.
我自己也不是个擅长动手的人, Storr 在这里就好了, 我想念他

61
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:45,745
Have you no weapons?
你没有武器吗？

62
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:48,323
Arden's tranquiliser gun, that's all.
Arden 的麻醉枪, 只有这个

63
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:49,663
Aye, it's not much.
啊, 作用不大

64
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:53,607
Storr was a huntsman. An expert with a bow and arrow.
Storr 以前是个猎人, 很善于用弓箭

65
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:54,944
Uhh, it's no good wishing.
唉, 说这个也没用了 (fixme)

66
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:56,970
Well, I'd better carry on.
我们还是继续吧

67
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,245
Aye, lead on McDuff.
是啊, 带路吧 fixme

68
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:07,827
Keep very still.
千万别动

69
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:22,281
So, you are afraid of us?
看来, 你害怕我们？

70
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:29,068
No, but of your ship. If the ioniser sets off a nuclear holocaust, it will all have be in vain.
不, 怕的是你的船．如果离子器不小心引发了核反应, 一切都将消于无形了

71
00:06:30,354 --> 00:06:36,762
That is good. In that case you dare not act.
这很好, 这种情况下你也不敢乱来

72
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:43,226
But if you thought there would be no explosion?
但如果你觉得不会发生爆炸呢？

73
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:46,319
Well?
什么？

74
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:49,490
Well in that case we'd have... we'd have no choice.
在那种情况下我们就．．．没有别的选择了

75
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:52,989
You would use the ioniser.
你将会使用你的离子器

76
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:55,457
But it wouldn't harm the ship, it would release it!
但它不会伤害到飞船的, 反而会将它释放出来

77
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:57,631
There would be floods.
这里会被水淹没

78
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,817
Our engines would be useless.
我们引擎就会失效

79
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,310
We would be at your mercy.
我们就只能求你们怜悯了

80
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,352
Why did you come here?
你为什么来这里？

81
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,575
To spy? To betray us?
做间谍？背叛我们？

82
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,230
But you could not hope to escape to tell the tale.
但你不可能再活着逃离这里, 去讲述你的故事了

83
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:17,795
Oh, I always live in hope.
和, 我永远都活在希望里

84
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:23,903
You have some kind of communicator.
你带着某种通讯设备

85
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:27,889
You do realise, don't you, that after a certain point, my base will...
看来你发现了, 是吧．过了一定的时间点, 我的基地就会．．．

86
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:31,115
...have to activate the ioniser regardless of the consequences?
．．．激活离子器, 不管后果是什么

87
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:35,007
And destroy you and themselves as well?
不惜杀死你, 杀死他们自己？

88
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:36,916
Is that what would happen?
这可能发生吗？

89
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:39,553
Give it to me.
把它给我

90
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:46,180
Ah, they would never know.
啊, 他们永远也不会知道

91
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:50,645
They would never know.
他们永远也不会知道

92
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:58,430
The Doctor. You heard what he said.
博士说的, 你都听到了

93
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:07,070
Regardless of the consequences. Yes. Yes, he's telling us to take the risk.
不计后果．是的．他在跟我们说要冒这个风险

94
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:11,681
But we can't give the computer the information it needs. It can't instruct us.
但我们还不能给电脑足够信息, 它没法分析出指令

95
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,972
Can the ioniser hold?
离子器能稳住吗？

96
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:22,662
Present power it's... steadily losing ground. But we dare not increase!
当前的能量．．．正在慢慢地流失．我们不敢加大功率

97
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:43,497
Summary of orders to all World loniser Stations: The new equation originated from Brittanicus Base
will be adopted to conditions prevailing in each sector.
All bases will prepare to use full ioniser attack on the ice in concerted action.
Zero hour in six hours exactly. Report readiness one hour.
发往全球各离子站的指令概述：要求在各区域普遍采用大不列颠基地的新方程式．
所有基地需要按预定程序对冰川施行最大功率的离子器攻击．
在六个小时内不间断执行(fixme)．请在一个小时内报告准备情况

98
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:47,936
We can't do it.
我们没法执行这个

99
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,676
But if we don't the whole plan must fail.
如果我们不执行, 整个计划就会失败

100
00:08:50,854 --> 00:09:00,888
But if we act and there is an explosion... apart from destroying this base, the contamination could easily...
但如果我们执行, 就有可能引发爆炸．．．不仅仅是这个基地被摧毁, 整个围困计划就可能轻易地．．．

101
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:03,712
We must state our problem to World Control, now.
我们必须向世界控制中心陈述我们的情况, 现在就要

102
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:11,346
No wait! We'll give our computer all the information we have.
等一下！我们要把我们拿到的所有情况提交到电脑

103
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:12,494
It isn't enough!
那还是不够

104
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:15,553
It may be. Er, it may be.
只是可能, 哦, 只是可能

105
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:17,236
I know what the computer will say.
我知道电脑会怎么说

106
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:19,737
No no no no no. Let the computer speak for itself.
不不不, 让电脑自己说

107
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:21,524
There's only one answer it can give!
它只可能给出一种答案

108
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,282
Come on, quickly. Put the situation to the computer.
别说了, 快吧．把情况报给电脑

109
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,836
Do as you're told!
你没有听到吗！

110
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:30,934
He's sizing us up.
它在打量我们

111
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:32,224
Can you not run for it?
你就不能跑吗？

112
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,888
I don't intend to leave you here as...
我可没打算把你留在这里．．．

113
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:36,951
Well the gun! Use the gun!
枪！用枪！

114
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:40,536
I could hit the side of the mountain. I'm a scientist, not a gladiator.
我可能打中的是山崖, 我是一个科学家, 不是一个角斗士

115
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,019
Well at least you can try!
至少要得试一试！

116
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:47,129
Alright. Cross your fingers. Here goes.
好吧, 你祈祷吧．开始了

117
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:55,715
Quick get me out of here, I'll tackle him! Get a hold of yourself man! Quick, he's nearly on us!
快把我从这里弄出来, 我来对付它！控制住自己, 朋友！快啊, 它过来了

118
00:09:57,258 --> 00:10:07,175
Set up all circuits to new equation. And wait. Further information essential before decision can be taken.
Prepare to notify World Control in event of emergency.
已按新方程式设定所有线路, 等待执行．在决策之前任何重要信息可继续提交．
请做好准备, 一有紧急情况就通知世界控制中心

119
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:16,971
Of course, the computer's right. We must be prepared. And we must wait.
当然．电脑是正确的．我们必须做好准备, 我也必须等待

120
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:20,561
It is the answer I expected.
这正是我期望的答案

121
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:27,134
But you don't realise why it made this choice, do you?
但你并不清楚它为什么做出这个选择, 是吧？

122
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,199
Because it is the most logical answer in the circumstances.
因为这是当前情况下最符合逻辑的答案

123
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:37,379
Of course. And because it's so logical, it can't gamble, it can't take risks.
当然．正因为它是最符合逻辑的, 它不可能赌博, 不可能冒风险

124
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:41,696
That is its function. To be totally impartial. To serve the community.
那正是它的功能．做到完全公正, 服务于社区

125
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:48,401
Exactly. And one more aim in its life: to survive.
正是如此．它的生命就一个目的：生存

126
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,446
It has given us its decision.
它已经给了我们它的决策

127
00:10:54,654 --> 00:11:00,678
It is no decision. The computer is playing for time.
那不是一个决策, 电脑只是在拖延时间

128
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:18,448
Now listen! All of you! We risk destruction either by a radioactive explosion, or, by the slow grind of the glaciers.
都听着, 你们所有人！我们现在要么会被放射性的爆炸立刻毁掉,要么被冰川慢慢碾压

129
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:29,305
Now there you see that the ice has advanced 100 metres today. Now either way...
你们可以看到冰山今天已经前进了100米, 所以要么．．．

130
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:31,525
The computer is destroyed.
电脑已经坏掉了

131
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:39,830
So that, by demanding a decision, we are asking it to commit suicide.
这种情况下, 我们要求电脑给出一个决策, 就等于要求它自杀

132
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:41,356
It can't do that!
它做不到！

133
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:44,826
Then what is the answer?
那答案是什么？

134
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:50,152
We can escape. There's still time to evacuate.
我们可以逃走, 现在撤离还来得及

135
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:55,291
Perhaps you could face world opinionata. I couldn't.
也许你可以面对全世界的指责 - 我不行

136
00:11:56,536 --> 00:12:00,247
You must notify World Control eventually. The other bases will be waiting.
最终你还是得通知世界控制中心, 其它的基地还在等着呢

137
00:12:00,396 --> 00:12:10,481
I will decide exactly when. For now we do as the computer says.
Prepare the ioniser, and wait. Now, complete data check please, Miss Garrett.
正是那时它会做出决策的．现阶段我们按电脑说的做．
准备好离子器, 然后等着．请完成数据检查, Gattett 小姐

138
00:12:15,724 --> 00:12:28,100
Miss Curtis, report to me the moment mark four reaches one-five-oh-oh. One-three-seven-nine, now.
Curtis 小姐, 第四个读数到达1500的时候请向我报告．现在是1379

139
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:41,747
Well, what do you feel about all this Walters? Bet you didn't think you'd have ice monsters
and things like that to deal with when you volunteered for the job, did you?
你对这一切怎么想, Walters？ 你没有想到要对付这些冰雪怪物吧
诸如此类东西 - 在你报名参加这项工作的时候, 是不？

140
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,110
Well, did you?
是吗？

141
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:50,460
I didn't volunteer.
我没有报名

142
00:12:50,947 --> 00:12:54,726
Ah, yes, well... good man, anyway.
啊, 是的, 很好．．．不错, 不管怎么说 

143
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:57,023
Penley! Penley, are you alright!
Penley! Penley, 你没事吧

144
00:12:57,322 --> 00:12:58,235
I'll get up...
我得起来

145
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,959
You sure you're alright?
你确定你没事吧

146
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,558
Well he's clawed me, that's all.
它抓伤了我, 没别的

147
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:05,272
Now we better get away quick. He won't be any friendlier when he wakes up!
我们最好赶紧走．它要是醒过来就不可能对我们友好了

148
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:15,907
Close engine room. Well?
关闭引擎室． 怎样？

149
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:22,086
It's an ion reactor, isn't it? Hmm. It could be dangerous, but it wouldn't necessarily explode.
这是一个离子反应器, 对吧？它是有点危险, 不过不会轻易就爆炸

150
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:26,693
True. But your friends do not know that.
的确, 但你的朋友们不知道这个

151
00:13:27,063 --> 00:13:29,046
Now why don't you let us help you?
那为什么不让我们来帮你们？

152
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:34,823
We can get what we want without your help.
没有你们的帮助, 我们也能得到我们需要的

153
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:39,257
But, but what else do you need, apart from escaping from the ice?
但你们还需要什么呢？不就是从冰上逃走？

154
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:47,707
We have had enough of your questions. Now you will give me answers.
我们已经受够了你这些问题．现在你得给我们些答案了

155
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:49,904
Well, I've told you all I can about the ioniser.
在离子器方面, 我能告诉你们的都已经告诉你们了

156
00:13:50,105 --> 00:13:56,911
That is only a toy. The base - what is its power source?
那只是一个玩具．关于基地 - 它的能量来源是什么？

157
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,646
Why on earth do you want to know that?
你为什么想知道这个？

158
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,730
Answer.
回答

159
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:03,391
Oh, so that's what you need is it?
哦！那正是你们需要的东西, 对不？

160
00:14:03,564 --> 00:14:05,578
Answer the Commander's questions.
回答指挥官的答案

161
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:11,573
Fuel! Fuel for your reactor! And suppose I don't tell you?
燃料！你们的反应器需要燃料！假设我不告诉你呢？

162
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:15,354
The girl dies, now.
这个女孩儿就得死, 现在

163
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:19,702
Doctor, don't tell them!
博士, 别告诉他们

164
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:27,248
Yes, you'll find what you need at the base.
好吧, 你可以在基地找到你们需要的东西

165
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:30,549
You shouldn't have!
你不应该的

166
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:34,652
But you, you won't find Leader Clent easy to persuade. He's a very obstinate man!
不过, 你们会发现组长 Clent 不太容易被说服．他是一个倔强的人

167
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:38,286
He will listen to our sonic cannon.
他会听命于我们的音速炮的

168
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:41,940
We must act quickly, Commander.
我们必须感觉行动, 指挥官

169
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:52,077
Isbur and Rintan, wait for me at the entrance to the cave.
Zondal, you will man the sonic gun.
Isbur 和 Rintan, 在洞窟门口等这我．
Zondal, 你带上音速枪

170
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:59,087
You won't succeed! You can't be so inhuman.
你们不会成功的, 你们不能这么没有人性

171
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:05,209
We only fight to win.
我们坚决战斗, 争取胜利

172
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,384
lon density reading at 1000?
离子浓度到了1000了吗

173
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:19,488
74 _.
 746

174
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:20,597
2000?

175
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:22,164
62 _.

176
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:23,481
3000?

177
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,198
43.3 _.

178
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:26,721
4000?

179
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:28,033
39 _.

180
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,373
5000?

181
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:30,438
35 _.

182
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:41,455
Reception check-point to Leader Clent.

Well I don't wish to be disturbed by trifles!
我可不希望被这些琐事打扰

186
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,722
These aren't scavengers Sir. It's the lad that came with the Doctor and Scientist Penley.
他们不是流浪汉, 先生．是跟着博士来的那个小伙子, 还有科学家 Penley 

187
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,181
What?

190
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,388
Bring the arrivals to me at once.
把来的两个人立刻带过来

191
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:02,217
Sir.
好的

192
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,357
Density compensator setting, please.
请给出浓度补偿器设置

193
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:17,887
Density compensator setting: zero-three-nine. Seven-seven-seven. Zero-one. Sequence ends.
浓度补偿器设置：039, 777, 01, 播报完毕

194
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:24,231
Take all systems up to this level. Everything seems to be proceeding satisfactorily.
将所有系统调整到这个水平．一切好像进行得还不错

195
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:25,563
Is it?
是吗？

196
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,087
What's wrong?
怎么了？

197
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:31,438
Penley's come back.
Penley 回来了

198
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:33,411
Of his own choice?
他自愿回来的？

199
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,332
Apparently.
看来是

200
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:37,715
Why?
为什么？

201
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:42,816
We shall soon see. If he tries to start any trouble...
我们一会儿就明白了．如果他打算捣什么乱．．．

202
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:45,753
Well, he can't be allowed to interfere with the program. Not at this stage.
我们不可能让他干涉我们的程序, 都到了现在这个地步了

203
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:58,430
No. I no longer need to be tolerant with him. 'Cause he's no longer my equal - he's an outsider.
不, 我不需要再忍受他了． 因为他不再是个对手(fixme) - 他是个外人

204
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:00,767
Come on then.
过来吧

205
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:02,479
Put him over here.

00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:10,807
No stay, Walters. You may be needed.
等一下, Walters, 可能还需要你

212
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,720
I'm not liable to be violent.
我不打算大闹一场

213
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:15,711
What do you want?
你想干什么？

214
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:18,241
Well I brought this lad. He's in desperate need of medical supervision.
我带这个小伙子过来．他迫切需要医护

215
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:20,183
We are not a first-aid center.
我们这里不是急救中心

216
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,427
He's paralysed.
他瘫痪了

217
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,142
How did it happen?
怎么造成的？

218
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,034
He was shot down by the warriors' guns.
他被那些寒冰勇士的枪射中了

219
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:32,293
Well thank heavens. Their weapons don't deal fatal blows.
啊谢天谢地, 他们的武器不是致命的

220
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:33,829
Well they killed Arden.
但他们杀死了 Arden

221
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:36,767
Look you've got to help.
你必须得帮忙了

222
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,935
Er, yes of course boy. Um, Walters will take you to the Medi-Control Centre.
呃, 当然是, 小伙子．呜, Walters 会把你带到医疗中心去

223
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:47,812
No I didn't mean me, I meant Victoria and the Doctor!
Look, they're inside the alien spaceship! You've got to help them.
不, 我不是说我, 我是说 Victoria 和博士
你看, 他们在外星飞船里, 你必须得帮助他们

224
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:49,058
That isn't possible.
那是不可能的

225
00:17:49,245 --> 00:17:50,735
Well why not? You've got to do something!
为什么不？你必须得做点什么

226
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:56,100
No, we lost contact with the Doctor over an hour ago. I'm afraid there's no hope.
不, 我们在一个小时前就跟博士失去联系了, 恐怕没有希望了

227
00:17:56,664 --> 00:18:06,430
You mean hope happens to be inconvenient! You've got to stick to your precious schedule, is that it?
You've got to wave your splendid ioniser about to prove that it works and never mind about human beings!
你说的没期望其实是怕麻烦！你就只考虑要紧贴你宝贵的进度计划, 是不是？
你就只想着到处挥舞你的离子器, 以证明它完全可行, 从来不考虑人的死活！

228
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:08,008
The computer has decided!
电脑已经做出决策了！

229
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:13,271
The compu... Override it! Let the ioniser wait. The computer isn't gonna fall apart because it has to mark time for an hour!
电脑．．．取消它! 离子器可以让它歇着．电脑又不会散架, 我们不是要再等一个小时吗？ 


230
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,698
We are marking time. We're not using the ioniser under instructions from the computer itself.
我们是在待命． 在电脑的指令下, 我们现在并没有开启离子器

231
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:17,595
Why?
为什么

232
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:22,569
The spaceship may contain a reactor system that could wipe us off this island if we cause it to explode.
那个飞船的反应器可能会因此而爆炸, 从而把我们从这个岛上都给抹去

233
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:23,948
So what are you gonna do?
那你们打算怎么办？

234
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,498
We obey the computer. We will wait.
我们听电脑的, 现在就待命

235
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:32,690
Wait? But that's suicide! The glacier's practically on top of us!
待命？这简直是自杀啊！冰山可切切实实在我们头上！

236
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:38,261
We still have time in hand.
我们手头还有时间

237
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:39,637
Yes, but if the Doctor, if he's...
是, 但是如果博士, 如果他．．．

238
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:40,276
No.
不

239
00:18:40,426 --> 00:18:42,637
If the Doctor doesn't contact you, what hope is there?
如果博士不再联系你们, 还有什么希望？

240
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:43,437
There is hope.
还是有希望

241
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:48,136
Oh don't be a fool, Clent! You're not a man, you're just a machine's slave.
哦别犯傻了, Clent! 你不是一个人, 你就是一个电脑奴隶

242
00:18:51,052 --> 00:19:17,951
Don't you spit your stupid liberty in my face, Penley.
We know your kind of freedom - freedom to run away - from responsibilities, from service, from moral judgement.
I may be a physical coward, Penley, you're a coward in the mind.
别我在面前喷你那些愚蠢的自由, Penley
我们知道你那种自由 - 逃走的自由, 免于责任的自由, 免于义务的自由, 免于道德判断的自由
我可能在行动上有些怯懦, Penley, 你在思想上是个懦夫

243
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:25,776
Well at least I have a mind and not a _ junction box. I would act, but you daren't.
And so you're going to be destroyed, along with your mechanical master.
至少我还有思想, 而不是个意识接线盒．我会行动, 但你不敢
所以你会被毁灭, 带着你的机器主人一起

244
00:19:25,976 --> 00:19:27,185
Look, you've got to help us man.
嘿, 你必须得帮帮我们

245
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:28,222
Jamie, I don't think you're...
Jamie, 我并不认为你．．．

246
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:29,378
Jamie, take it easy.
Jamie, 冷静点

247
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,268
Ahh! Now, get them out of here!
啊！ 现在把他们给我赶出去！

248
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:48,639
You'd better take them to the Medi-Control Centre. Get someone to look at the boy.
Make sure there's a guard for when they come to.
你最好带他们去医护中心．找个人看一下这个孩子．
确保他们醒来的时候有一个保安在旁边．

249
