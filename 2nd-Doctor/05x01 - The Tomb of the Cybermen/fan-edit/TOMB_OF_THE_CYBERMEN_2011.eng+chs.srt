- What happened?  - I don't know.
- 发生了什么?   - 我不知道

collect 50 pounds from you or anybody else.
好了，有件事可以肯定，他没法从你这里拿走拿50英镑了

If you put it like that, I certainly will.

Who are you and where are you from?

And you'd better have a good story.

20
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:57,059
Maybe you'll not get one.

21
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,582
Listen, fella.
We're not playing games.
听着，伙计，我们不是在玩游戏

- You'd better listen to him.
- What's been happening over here?

He was killed the moment you men  appeared.

00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:13,017
Ah. And you think we did it?

Oh no, I can assure you, we had nothing
to do with the death of this man.

Trying to open these doors, perhaps?

- A wiseguy!
- 他似乎知道所有的答案  - 一个聪明人!

I think this fellow must be
a member of a rival expedition.

30
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:30,060
(DOCTOR) Expedition?

Archaeologist written all over him.

00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,778
- Really? Does it show?  - You see?

It's impossible to keep a secret
in the scientific world.
在科学时间里几乎不可能保守住秘密

- 博士，你什么意思?   - 告诉他们吧，博士

No, not until they tell us

We are searching the universe
for the last remains of the Cybermen.

Cybermen? You mean to say they came from here?

00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:58,263
Of course. Telos was their home.

This is the entrance to their city.

We know they died out centuries ago,

what we don't know is why they died out.

Callum, Rogers! Get him back to the rocket. 
I'll be with you in a minute.
Callum, Rogers! 来把他抬回火箭去，我很快回来找你们

to the rocket with me, Professor?
就是这样．你跟我们回火箭吗，教授? 

46
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:14,785
- What for?
- You're not going on with this, are you?
- 为什么回去?   - 你不打算继续了吧，是吗? 

47

I don't know if these people had 
anything to do with it or not, 
我不知道这些人跟这事有没有关系

48
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:21,175
but one of my men was just been killed.
You're not paying that kind of money.
但我的一个人刚刚死了．你并不打算这种情况付钱

49
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,781
- Yes, I suppose that's quite true.
- You think it over.
- 是的，我觉得是这样  - 你想清楚了

50
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:26,700
Come on, let's go.
We'll wait for you at the ship.
快点，我们走，我们在飞船上等你们

51
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:29,865
The problem, I take it,
is to open these doors, right?
现在的问题，照我理解，是怎么打开门，对吧? 

52
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:32,056
- Ha! Brilliant.  - That is the problem.
- 哈! 高见  - 那就是问题

53
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,661
And we would prefer it, if you return
to wherever you came from.
而我们更愿意的是，你们从哪里来回那里去

54
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:37,580
- Not very friendly, are they?
- Do as he says.
- 他们不太友好，是吧?   - 按他说的做

55
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:41,296
That became impossible the moment
that name was mentioned - Cybermen.
那已经变得不可能了，因为那个名字被提到了 - 赛博人

56
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:43,105
Cybermen? What are they?
赛博人? 是什么? 

57
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:44,843
I knew they're here on the same quest!
我就知道，他们是为了同一个任务来这里的

58
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,543
No one would come here for any other reason?

59
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:48,186
- We must stay!  - Doctor!
- 我们必须留下来!   - 博士! 

60
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,906
Must we? I don't like
the look of those things at all.
必须吗? 我完全不喜欢这些事情的样子

61
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:52,404
We shall stay and help you with your research.
我们会留下来，帮助你们进行研究

62
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,104
Perhaps we don't want help.
也许我们并不需要什么帮助

63
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:56,975
That's just it. You obviously do. 
Now I'm sure we can agree.
这就是了，你们显然需要．我确定我们可以达成一致

64
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:59,546
- I can open those doors for you.
- It's our problem!
- 我能帮你们打开这道门  - 这是我们自己的事! 

65
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:02,778
Can I suggest you take this ridiculous
expedition of yours off this planet!
我建议你们，把你们这个荒谬的探险从这个星球上带走!

66
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:05,177
It seems to me we have
as much right here as you have.
在我看来，我们在这里跟你们有一样的权利

67
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:07,799
Of course you have! 
Mr Klieg, must I remind you again...
你们当然有! Klieg 先生，需要我再提醒你一次吗? 

68
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,699
that you do not speak for this expedition?
I am its leader.
你并不能代表探险队说话．我才是队长

69
00:05:10,787 --> 00:05:13,626
You and Miss Kaftan
are only here on sufferance.
你和 Kaftan 小姐在这里只是出于我们的宽容

70
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:16,221
- Thank you. And whose money is paying 
for the hire of that rocket?
- (KAFTAN) Mine!
- 多谢提醒．为火箭雇人用的是谁的钱?   - 我的! 

71
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:19,060
I thought I made it clear
that your financial support...
我想我明确过了，你们的经济支持...

72
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:22,105
did not entitle you to a say
in the running of this expedition!
并没有赋予你们在探险队运作上的发言权!

73
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,417
Of course. It was quite clear.
当然，你说得很清楚

74
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:26,418
Was it not, Eric?
不是吗，Eric? 

75
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:29,704
Of course.
No one questions your leadership.
当然，没有人质疑你的领导权

76
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:32,222
Good. That's all settled.
好，那一切都解决了

77
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:35,936
- And now we shall open these doors.
- What...?
- 那现在我们去把门打开  - 怎么...? 

78
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:39,059
- Careful, man!  - Doctor!
- 小心，朋友!   - 博士! 

79
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,660
Perfectly safe now.
现在完全安全了

80
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:52,863
- You'll be killed!  - Don't touch him!
- 你会死的!   - 别碰他! 

81
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:00,506
- It's beyond my strength.
- Let me, Doctor.
- 我力气不够  - 让我来，博士

82
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:07,297
I've not had much exercise lately.
我最近没怎么锻炼

83
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:10,857
Quite. I think here is a gentleman
who could open these doors for us.
是．我觉得这里有个先生可以帮我们把门打开

84
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:14,298
He is my servant.
I will not have him risk his life.
他是我的仆人，我不会允许他冒生命危险

85
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:18,486
Surely it was just for such a contingency like this
that you insisted we bring him with us.
就是为了这样的意外，你才坚持让我们把他带在队里的

86
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:21,106
There's no danger now.
Unless he's afraid.
现在没有危险了，除非他害怕

87
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:23,098
No, no. He's not afraid.
不不，他不害怕

88
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,023
- Come on.  - No. Wait!
- 快来  - 不，等等

89
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:53,905
I would be very careful in there
if I were you.
如果我是你，我进去会很小心的

90
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:56,262
Why weren't Toberman killed?
Why weren't you killed?
为什么 Toberman 没死? 为什么你没死? 

91
00:06:56,347 --> 00:07:00,306
The poor fellow who died drained
all the electricity out of his body.
死去的那个可怜家伙，用他的身体把电都吸干了

92
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,139
It's perfectly safe to go in now.
现在进去完全安全了

93
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:03,819
We're wasting time.
我们在浪费时间

94
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:06,946
Of course. After you, Professor.
的确是．你先请，教授

95
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,499
But I'd still...
但我还是...

96
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:16,376
I'd still be very careful if I were you. 
Very careful indeed.

97
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:19,104
Come on. Let's join them.
快来，跟他们一起

98
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,265

You look very nice in that dress.
你穿着这条裙子非常漂亮

100
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:30,217
Thank you.
Don't you think it's a bit...?
谢谢你．你没觉得它有点..

101
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:33,299
Short? I shouldn't worry.
Look at Jamie's.
短吗? 我就不担心．看看Jamie 的

102
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,742
I'll have you know that... Oh, aye.
我得让你知道...噢，是

103
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:38,466
Come along. Let's go and see
what the others are doing.

104
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:51,419
(VICTORIA)
Mercy! Just look at this place.
怜悯! 看看这个地方

105
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:53,896
These controls are of earlier dynasties.
这些开关都是上个时代的

106
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,785
Not so early. Look, John...
没那么早．你看，John

107
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,540
I'm quite capable of making
my own deductions! Thank you.
我完全有能力自己来推断! 谢谢你

108
00:07:58,627 --> 00:07:59,946
All right.
好吧

Be careful. There might be danger.
小心，这可能有危险

110
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:06,025
Don't worry, with Toberman to guard me.
别担心，有 Toberman 护着我呢

111
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:08,940
What is more important is 
to keep an eye on these strangers.
更重要的是，得盯着点这些陌生人

112
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:10,783
- I tried to...!
- Do not raise your voice.
- 我试图...  - 别那么大声

113
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:12,783
You will achieve nothing by shouting.
靠大喊大叫是什么也无法达成的

114
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:16,860
You look after the Doctor
and I will watch the girl.
你看着博士，我盯着这个女孩儿

115
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:19,825
- And the Scots boy?
- Leave him to Toberman.
- 那个苏格兰男孩儿呢?   - 把他留给 Toberman

116
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,986
Eh, Toberman?
嗯，Toberman? 

117
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:26,026
- But you will be careful and discreet. Understand?
- I understand.
- 但你得小心谨慎点，明白吗?   - 明白

118
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:29,896
- Did you ever see the like of it, Doctor?
- Not exactly, Jamie, but very nearly.
- 你见过这样的吗，博士?   - 还没有，Jamie，不过很类似

119
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:33,303
(PARRY) Now that we're all here...
既然我们都在这里...

120
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:38,381
Now that we're all here, we'd better
take stock of the situation.
既然我们都在这里了，我们最好评估一下情况

121
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,662
This appears to be a dead end.
这边似乎是条死路

122
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:43,536
The only way out is through that hatch.
唯一出去的路就是那个舱门

123
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,105
- Are there no doors?
- No. Apart from the entrance.
- 没有门吗?   - 没有，只有这个入口

124
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:48,278
- And the other two, of course.
- Two other doors?
- 和另外两个，当然了  - 另外还有两个? 

125
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:52,201
Yes. One in that section
and one in that section over there.
是的，一个在这一段，还有一个在那边那段

126
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:55,563
Activated, I imagine, by this
simple logical system here.
激活方法，我估计，是用这边的简单符号逻辑系统

127
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:58,081
Here we are, I think.
就这里，我想

128
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:04,677
(BLEEPING)

129
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,201
Yes, splendid! A simple logical gate.
是的，太棒了!一个简单的逻辑门

130
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:16,038
Doctor, you seem to be
very familiar with this place.
博士，你似乎非常熟悉这个地方

131
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:19,517
Not really. It's all based on symbolic logic.
还真不是，这全都是基于符号逻辑

132
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:21,359
The same as you use in computers.
跟你们在电脑里用的一样

133
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:24,484
The opening mechanism of this door -
an OR gate, as you call it.
打开这道门的机制，是一道或门，你们的叫法是这样的

134
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,684
Yes, I can see that, but how did you know
in the first place?
是的，我看得出来，但你一开始是怎么知道的? 

135
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,758
I use my own special technique.
我使用我自己的特殊技巧

136
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:32,315
Really? And may we know what that is?
真的? 那可以告诉我们是什么吗? 

137
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:35,636
Keeping my eyes open
and my mouth shut.
睁大眼睛，闭上嘴巴

138
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:40,237
We are too many to explore together.
I think we'd better divide up.
我们人太多了，难以一起探索．我想我们最好分开

139
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:44,240
If you, Mr Viner, would take that door with...
如果你，Viner 先生，走那个门，与...

140
00:09:44,327 --> 00:09:46,636
- Jamie.  - Jamie and Mr Haydon.
- 我叫Jamie  - 与Jamie 和 Haydon 先生一起

141
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:49,605
Mr Klieg, the Doctor and myself
will be a party.
Klieg，以及博士和我一队

142
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,599
- What about us?
- I think the women should better to remain here.
- 我们怎么办?   - 我觉得女人最好留在这里

143
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:54,917
Rubbish! We can make a party.
胡说! 我们可以组一队

144
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:58,716
Certainly. With Toberman to guard us, 
we need fear no one.
当然．有 Toberman 保护，我们谁也不怕了

145
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,877
Mr Klieg, will you take them with you?
Klieg 先生，你会带他们一起吗? 

146
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,117
- I prefer to stay here.  - As you wish.
- 我情愿留在这里  - 随便你了

147
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:05,926
Mr Viner, will you go along with the women?
Viner 先生，你可以跟女人们一起走吗? 

148
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:09,841
- If you like.
- Get back to the spacecraft by 16.30.
- 随你安排  - 要在16:30回到飞船

149
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:12,157
You all know the temperature drop at night,
你们都知道，气温会在晚间下降

150
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:15,920
so we'll meet back here at 16.25.
If anyone is missing...
所以我们在16:25回这里会合．如果有人失踪...

151
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:18,556
that gives us an hour to look for them 
before we have to leave.
这可以给我们一个小时去寻找他们，之后就必须得离开了

152
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:21,878
Come on then. We might as well
try that opening over there.
那就来吧．我们可能得试试那边的开关

153
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:24,844
We'd better keep close together.
我们最好待在一起

154
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:26,997
I'm all right, thank you.
我没事，谢谢你

155
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,645
- Come on, Jamie.  - Right.
- 快来，Jamie  - 好

156
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:33,958
Now to concentrate on this, whatever it is.
现在聚焦一下这个东西，不管它是什么

157
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,436
This hatch must lead somewhere
这个舱门肯定通向某个地方

158
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:38,882
and there must be 
some opening mechanism.
而且肯定有某种打开机制

159
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:43,358
What was that about
symbolic logic? Any ideas?
那跟符号逻辑有什么关系? 谁知道? 

160
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:45,445
No, not really.
不，不怎么知道

161
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:48,200
I think it's time
we gave Mr Klieg a chance
我看是时候给 Klieg 先生一个机会了

162
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:50,642
to show off his archaeological skills.
让他来炫耀一下他的考古技巧

163
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:55,919
Come on. Right in.
快来，进来了

164
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:00,920
Where's Toberman?
Toberman 去哪儿了? 

165
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:03,077
I sent him to join the others.
我让他加入其他组了

166
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:06,364
We do not need protection
now that you are with us.
既然你跟我们在一起，我们不需要保护了

167
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:08,517
Yes. Well, shall we commence?
是的．怎样，我们开始吧? 

168
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:11,440
Everything must be carefully
measured and recorded.
每样东西都必须精心测量、仔细记录

169
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:13,019
What is this room?
这是个什么房间

170
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:16,861
I don't know. Possibly this is
where the Cybermen are made.
我不知道．也许这是赛博人被造出来的地方

171
00:11:17,747 --> 00:11:19,419
I wonder what this is.
我很好奇这是什么

172
00:11:24,107 --> 00:11:27,543
Do you mind? You're in my way.
Just go over there.
抱歉，你妨碍到我了．去那边吧

173
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:28,946
Oh, fiddle!
噢，瞎搞

174
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:32,338
Could this not be the purpose of the room?
这可能是这个房间的目的吗? 

175
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:33,746
Yes?
什么

176
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:38,105
A Cyberman would stand
in that form and be...
赛博人就站在那里面，然后就被...

177
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:41,541
Well, revitalised.
嗯，焕发生机了

178
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:44,739
Yes, that's reasonable.
是的，有道理

179
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:50,503
These projectors probably meant to fire in
some neuro-electric potential.
这些射枪很可能是用来注入神经电势能的

180
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:52,979
That's it. I think you're right.
是的，我觉得你说得对

181
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:56,216
Revitalising is just what I need.
我正好也需要重新焕发生机

182
00:11:58,347 --> 00:12:01,419
Mercy! The Cybermen
must have been giants!/
天呐，赛博人一定都是巨人! 

183
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:15,266
Well?
怎样? 

184
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:19,561
The basis of this code
is binary to digital conversion,
这段编码的基础是二进制到数字转换

185
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:22,798
with an intervening step involving
a sort of Whitehead logic.
夹杂了一个中间步骤，这个步骤涉及某种怀特黑德逻辑

186
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:25,959
When this Bourrier series is complete, 
then there is no more to be done.
当Bourrier系列完成的时候，就搞定了fixme

187
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:28,265
- Yes, but why do it at all?
- Really, Doctor?
- 是，但为什么要弄那个?   - 真的吗，博士? 

188
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:32,045
For an archaeologist, you seem to
be curiously lacking in curiosity.
作一个考古学家，你居然缺乏好奇心

189
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:35,756
Some things are better left undone
and I have a feeling this is one of them.
有些东西最好别动，而我有种感觉，这就是其中之一

190
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:37,678
What do you mean by that?
这么说是什么意思? 

191
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,962
- It's all too easy, isn't it?  - Easy?
- 所有这些都太容易了，是不?   - 容易? 

192
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:42,083
I wouldn't call this an easy survey. Would you?
我不会把这称为容易的调查．你会? 

193
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:45,637
Everything is designed to keep their secrets,
whatever they are, insoluble.
所有这些的设计目的，都是为了让他们的秘密无法解开

194
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:47,922
Insoluble? Oh, I wouldn't say that.
无法解开? 噢，我不会这么说

195
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:52,398
Take this mathematical sequence for example.
I'm really no nearer to its solution.
拿这个数学序列来说，我真的离解开它还远着呢

196
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:55,843
I've tried every combination.
It's hardly call that easy.
我试了所有的组合了．真没法把这说是“容易”

197
00:12:55,927 --> 00:13:00,125
Yes. Well, what you've done here
is mostly right.
是．不过，你在这里已经完成的绝大部分都是对的

198
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,677
- Thank you (!)
- You see, any progressive series
- 谢谢你  - 你看，任何递进的系列

199
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,997
can be converted into binary notation.
都可以被转换为二进制写法

200
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,965
If you take the sum of the integrets
如果你对整数求和

201
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:11,607
and express the result as a power series,
再将结果表达为幂数系列

202
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:14,360
then the indices show the basic binary blocks.
然后指数就会呈现基本的二元块了
<i>(这一段完全不懂，瞎翻译，抱歉)</i>

203
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,156
Only I wouldn't do it if I were you.
Oh, I really wouldn't do it.
只是我就不会这么做，如果我是你的话．噢，我真的不会

204
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,045
Of course! You're right!
当然! 你是对的! 

205
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:31,077
(LOW HUMMING)

206
00:13:31,487 --> 00:13:35,719
Look! Sum between limits of one and 91
看! 对1和91求和

207
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:39,197
integral into power series... Yes, yes!
积分到幂数系列，对了，对了! 

208
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,835
Then you differentiate...
然后再进行差分...

209
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,201
You fool! Why couldn't you leave it alone?
你个蠢人! 怎么你就不能别碰它? 

210
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:48,964
- What's happening?  - I don't know.
- 怎么了?   - 我不知道

211
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:51,926
Perhaps the Cybermen aren't as
quite dormant as you imagine.
也许赛博人不像我们想的那样完全在休眠

212
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:53,326
Yes, we must find out
what's happened to the others.
是了，我们必须看看其他人怎么样了

213
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:04,017
- Is that all?  - Aye.
- 都试过了?   - 是

214
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:06,018
All except this big button here. 
What does that do?
都试过了，除了这个大按钮，它是干什么的? 

215
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:08,063
I'm not sure, but we'll find out.
我不确定，但我们会弄明白

216
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,741
I'm going to trace the source
of these shapes.
我打算跟踪一下这些形体的来源

217
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:13,467
There must be a projector somewhere.
肯定某个地方有个投射器

218
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:16,422
- When I give the word, press the button.
- The big one?
- 我喊的时候，就按那个按钮  - 大这个? 

219
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,418
Yes. Maybe it works in conjunction with the others.
也许它要跟其它的一起才能生效

220
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:21,863
- Right. Ready when you are.
- OK. Go ahead.
- 好，等你准备好了  - 好，开始吧

221
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:32,538
- Jamie, don't touch that control!
- I already have.
- Jamie，别碰那个开关!   - 我已经碰了

222
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,902
- What's the matter, Doctor?
- Which one was it?
- 什么情况，博士  - 刚才是哪个? 

223
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:36,306
Which one what?
哪个怎么了? 

224
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:45,519
Aaagh!
啊! 

225
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,742
- Careful, Doctor!  - It's all right. I...
- 小心，博士!   - 没事，我...

226
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:53,819
I think it's all right now.
我觉得现在没事了

227
00:14:55,067 --> 00:15:00,300
Yes. You see. It's just a mock-up, a model.
是的，你看．这只是一个样机，一个模型

228
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:03,140
Don't touch that!
That gun may be wired up too.
别碰那个! 那把枪可能还没断开

229
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:04,722
- It's a trap.  - No, I don't think so.
- 这是个陷阱  - 不，我不觉得

230
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:07,303
It's a testing room for weapons.
这是一间武器测试室

231
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:09,557
This is a purely robotic Cyberman.
这纯粹只是个机械赛博人

232
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:12,081
There's no human material in it at all.
里面没有任何人类材料

233
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,886
It's a target for weapons.
它是武器的靶子

234
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:18,198
Let's get back to the control room
with this poor fellow.
我们回到控制室吧，带上这个可怜的家伙

235
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,359
What's that?
那是什么? 

236
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:23,563
(JAMIE) Some wee creature
I found on the floor.
我在地板上找到的小怪物

237
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:26,999
It's a fossil.
像是个化石

238
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:29,362
Victoria, be careful! Let me see that.
Victoria, 小心! 让我看看

239
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:35,676
Yes, it's certainly inactive,
but it's not a fossil.
是的，它的确是不活跃了，但并不是个化石

240
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:37,959
Wait a minute.
等一下

241
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,879
Yes. Here we are.
是的，我们找到了

242
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:45,080
Yes.
是的

243
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:47,123
It's a Cybermat.
这是个赛博鼠

244
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,004
What's a Cybermat?
赛博鼠是什么? 

245
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:52,284
It's one of those...
I'd leave it alone if I were you.
它是一种...反正如果我是你就不会去碰它

246
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:57,642
I just don't understand this code.
我死活搞不明白这段编码

247
00:15:57,727 --> 00:15:59,638
The sequence doesn't make complete sense.
这个序列完全没有意义

248
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:01,922
You, a logician, can't understand it?
你，一个逻辑学家，搞不明白它? 

249
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:04,396
- You must.
- But in the time we have...
- 你必须  - 但我们就这么些时间...

250
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:07,365
We have plenty of time. You will see.
我们有很多时间，你会发现的

251
00:16:07,527 --> 00:16:10,758
- Lay him down there.
- What has happened to him?
- 把他在这里放下吧  - 他怎么了? 

252
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:13,486
There's been a terrible accident. 
He's been shot.
发生了一次可怕的意外，他被枪击了

253
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,276
Right. We're all here, it seems.
Would you all sit down for a moment?
好，看起来我们都到了．你们都坐下来歇一会儿吗? 

254
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:18,766
Toberman?
Toberman?﻿

255
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:24,005
Mr Klieg?
Klieg 先生? 

256
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,476
Leave me alone. Can't you see I'm working?
别烦我，你没看见我正在工作吗? 

257
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:29,320
Have you forgotten
the purpose of this expedition?
你已经忘记这次探险的目的了? 

258
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:33,275
This directly concerns my expedition.
You will kindly take your place.
这直接关系到我的探险．请你去就坐

259
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:42,795
Right. I'll come straight to the point.
好，那我就开门见山了

260
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:49,480
I have reluctantly decided to abandon
the expedition and return to Earth.
我很不情愿地决定，放弃这次探险，回地球去

261
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:52,719
- It's impossible!
- I feel just as strongly about it as you.
- 这不可能!   - 我对此也有与你们一样强烈的感觉

262
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,118
This expedition has been
my dream for many years.
这次探险是我多年的梦想

263
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:59,802
There were some, like Mr Viner,
said more preparation was needed -
曾经有些人，比如 Viner 先生，说过需要做更多准备

264
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:01,366
more men and equipment.
更多的人和设备

265
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:06,282
I refused to heed their warnings,
and the result is that two have died.
我没有重视这些警告，结果是有两个人死掉了

266
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:10,076
I'm sorry, but we must leave
at the first available conjunction.
我很抱歉，但我们必须在第一次有可用连接时就离开

We'll take back all we can
for further study of course.
当然，我们尽可能带走一些东西，以供后续研究

268
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:17,285
But that is my decision
and that is what we must do.

is properly tangential,

- No.
- 你能准备好在18:42升空吗?   - 不能

I beg your pardon. Did I hear you right?
对不起，我没听错吧?

You are paid to take orders.
你拿了钱，就得遵从命令

276
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,325
Not impossible ones.
但做不到的命令就遵从不了

It's the fuel pumps.
Some character has balled-up the lot.

There's no doubt about it.
The major workings lie below.

There are metal caverns
down there, all interconnected.

If only we can get down to them.

That's it! I've got it!

Finally, a Boolean function
of symbolic logic.

I think perhaps your logic
is wearing a little thin.
我看你的逻辑有点站不住脚啊

291
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:39,624
I must have made a mistake.
I'll do it again more carefully.

to arise from their winter sleep.

A signal they are never going to get.

We'd better get busy.
Everything must be recorded.

We're trapped down here now.

Well?

What are they playing at up there?
被关上了．他们为什么这么做? 他们在上面玩什么啊?
