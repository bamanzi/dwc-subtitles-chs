<b>The Tomb of the Cybermen</b>
(Whopix fan edit)

2
00:00:41,227 --> 00:00:43,980
Stand by. Everybody down.

3
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:37,982
to open the doors.

4
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:41,935
Miss Kaftan, I must remind you
that I am the leader of the...

5
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:02,302
- What happened?  - I don't know.

6
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:07,177
Well, one thing for sure, he's not going to
collect 50 pounds from you or anybody else.

7
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:09,542
- Quiet. Quiet a minute.  - What's that?

8
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:11,538
Sounded like an engine.

9
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:13,026
(WHOOSHING)

10
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:15,941
- Something came down there! Behind that ...
- OK, Viner. Slow down.

11
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:19,177
- I'll take care of this. Jim!
- OK. I've got it!

12
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:38,699
(LOW VOICES)

13
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:41,698
Hold it right there, friend.

14
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,023
If you put it like that, I certainly will.

15
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:46,939
Hear that, Professor? English.

16
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:48,938
(PARRY) Yes. All right, Hopper.

17
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:51,060
Thank you.

18
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:53,138
Who are you and where are you from?

19
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,298
And you'd better have a good story.

20
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:57,059
Maybe you'll not get one.

21
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,582
Listen, fella.
We're not playing games.

22
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:03,137
- You'd better listen to him.
- What's been happening over here?

23
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:10,923
He was killed the moment you men  appeared.

24
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:13,017
Ah. And you think we did it?

25
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:16,019
Oh no, I can assure you, we had nothing
to do with the death of this man.

26
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:19,418
He appears to have been electrocuted.

27
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,376
Trying to open these doors, perhaps?

28
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:25,061
- He seems to know all the answers.
- A wiseguy!

29
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:28,541
I think this fellow must be
a member of a rival expedition.

30
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:30,060
(DOCTOR) Expedition?

31
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:33,344
We've tried to keep it secret.
Unsuccessfully, now it appears.

32
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:35,622
Archaeologist written all over him.

33
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,778
- Really? Does it show?  - You see?

34
00:03:37,947 --> 00:03:40,780
It's impossible to keep a secret
in the scientific world.

35
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,786
- Doctor, what do you mean?
- Tell them, go on, Doctor, tell them.

36
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:46,135
No, not until they tell us
the purpose of their expedition.

37
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:48,616
This is an archaeological expedition.

38
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:52,416
We are searching the universe
for the last remains of the Cybermen.

39
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:56,226
Cybermen? You mean to say they came from here?

40
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:58,263
Of course. Telos was their home.

41
00:03:58,427 --> 00:04:00,224
This is the entrance to their city.

42
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,459
We know they died out centuries ago,

43
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,459
what we don't know is why they died out.

44
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:08,620
Callum, Rogers! Get him back to the rocket.
I'll be with you in a minute.

45
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:11,904
That's that. Are you coming back
to the rocket with me, Professor?

46
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:14,785
- What for?
- You're not going on with this, are you?

47
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:16,301
I don't know if these people had
anything to do with it or not,

48
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:21,175
but one of my men was just been killed.
You're not paying that kind of money.

49
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,781
- Yes, I suppose that's quite true.
- You think it over.

50
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:26,700
Come on, let's go.
We'll wait for you at the ship.

51
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:29,865
The problem, I take it,
is to open these doors, right?

52
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:32,056
- Ha! Brilliant.  - That is the problem.

53
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,661
And we would prefer it, if you return
to wherever you came from.

54
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:37,580
- Not very friendly, are they?
- Do as he says.

55
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:41,296
That became impossible the moment
that name was mentioned - Cybermen.

56
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:43,105
Cybermen? What are they?

57
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:44,843
I knew they're here on the same quest!

58
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,543
No one would come here for any other reason?

59
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:48,186
- We must stay!  - Doctor!

60
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,906
Must we? I don't like
the look of those things at all.

61
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:52,404
We shall stay and help you with your research.

62
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,104
Perhaps we don't want help.

63
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:56,975
That's just it. You obviously do.
Now I'm sure we can agree.

64
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:59,546
- I can open those doors for you.
- It's our problem!

65
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:02,778
Can I suggest you take this ridiculous
expedition of yours off this planet!

66
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:05,177
It seems to me we have
as much right here as you have.

67
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:07,799
Of course you have!
Mr Klieg, must I remind you again...

68
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,699
that you do not speak for this expedition?
I am its leader.

69
00:05:10,787 --> 00:05:13,626
You and Miss Kaftan
are only here on sufferance.

70
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:16,221
- Thank you. And whose money is paying
for the hire of that rocket?
- (KAFTAN) Mine!

71
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:19,060
I thought I made it clear
that your financial support...

72
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:22,105
did not entitle you to a say
in the running of this expedition!

73
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,417
Of course. It was quite clear.

74
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:26,418
Was it not, Eric?

75
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:29,704
Of course.
No one questions your leadership.

76
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:32,222
Good. That's all settled.

77
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:35,936
- And now we shall open these doors.
- What...?

78
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:39,059
- Careful, man!  - Doctor!

79
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,660
Perfectly safe now.

80
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:52,863
- You'll be killed!  - Don't touch him!

81
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:00,506
- It's beyond my strength.
- Let me, Doctor.

82
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:07,297
I've not had much exercise lately.

83
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:10,857
Quite. I think here is a gentleman
who could open these doors for us.

84
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:14,298
He is my servant.
I will not have him risk his life.

85
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:18,486
Surely it was just for such a contingency like this
that you insisted we bring him with us.

86
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:21,106
There's no danger now.
Unless he's afraid.

87
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:23,098
No, no. He's not afraid.

88
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,023
- Come on.  - No. Wait!

89
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:53,905
I would be very careful in there
if I were you.

90
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:56,262
Why weren't Toberman killed?
Why weren't you killed?

91
00:06:56,347 --> 00:07:00,306
The poor fellow who died drained
all the electricity out of his body.

92
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,139
It's perfectly safe to go in now.

93
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:03,819
We're wasting time.

94
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:06,946
Of course. After you, Professor.

95
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,499
But I'd still...

96
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:16,376
I'd still be very careful if I were you.
Very careful indeed.

97
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:19,104
Come on. Let's join them.

98
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,265
Come on, Victoria.

99
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,897
You look very nice in that dress.

100
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:30,217
Thank you.
Don't you think it's a bit...?

101
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:33,299
Short? I shouldn't worry.
Look at Jamie's.

102
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,742
I'll have you know that... Oh, aye.

103
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:38,466
Come along. Let's go and see
what the others are doing.

104
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:51,419
(VICTORIA)
Mercy! Just look at this place.

105
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:53,896
These controls are of earlier dynasties.

106
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,785
Not so early. Look, John...

107
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,540
I'm quite capable of making
my own deductions! Thank you.

108
00:07:58,627 --> 00:07:59,946
All right.

109
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,978
Be careful. There might be danger.

110
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:06,025
Don't worry, with Toberman to guard me.

111
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:08,940
What is more important is
to keep an eye on these strangers.

112
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:10,783
- I tried to...!
- Do not raise your voice.

113
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:12,783
You will achieve nothing by shouting.

114
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:16,860
You look after the Doctor
and I will watch the girl.

115
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:19,825
- And the Scots boy?
- Leave him to Toberman.

116
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,986
Eh, Toberman?

117
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:26,026
- But you will be careful and discreet. Understand?
- I understand.

118
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:29,896
- Did you ever see the like of it, Doctor?
- Not exactly, Jamie, but very nearly.

119
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:33,303
(PARRY) Now that we're all here...

120
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:38,381
Now that we're all here, we'd better
take stock of the situation.

121
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,662
This appears to be a dead end.

122
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:43,536
The only way out is through that hatch.

123
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,105
- Are there no doors?
- No. Apart from the entrance.

124
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:48,278
- And the other two, of course.
- Two other doors?

125
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:52,201
Yes. One in that section
and one in that section over there.

126
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:55,563
Activated, I imagine, by this
simple logical system here.

127
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:58,081
Here we are, I think.

128
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:04,677
(BLEEPING)

129
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,201
Yes, splendid! A simple logical gate.

130
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:16,038
Doctor, you seem to be
very familiar with this place.

131
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:19,517
Not really. It's all based on symbolic logic.

132
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:21,359
The same as you use in computers.

133
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:24,484
The opening mechanism of this door -
an OR gate, as you call it.

134
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,684
Yes, I can see that, but how did you know
in the first place?

135
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,758
I use my own special technique.

136
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:32,315
Really? And may we know what that is?

137
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:35,636
Keeping my eyes open
and my mouth shut.

138
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:40,237
We are too many to explore together.
I think we'd better divide up.

139
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:44,240
If you, Mr Viner, would take that door with...

140
00:09:44,327 --> 00:09:46,636
- Jamie.  - Jamie and Mr Haydon.

141
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:49,605
Mr Klieg, the Doctor and myself
will be a party.

142
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,599
- What about us?
- I think the women should better to remain here.

143
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:54,917
Rubbish! We can make a party.

144
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:58,716
Certainly. With Toberman to guard us,
we need fear no one.

145
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,877
Mr Klieg, will you take them with you?

146
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,117
- I prefer to stay here.  - As you wish.

147
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:05,926
Mr Viner, will you go along with the women?

148
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:09,841
- If you like.
- Get back to the spacecraft by 16.30.

149
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:12,157
You all know the temperature drop at night,

150
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:15,920
so we'll meet back here at 16.25.
If anyone is missing...

151
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:18,556
that gives us an hour to look for them
before we have to leave.

152
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:21,878
Come on then. We might as well
try that opening over there.

153
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:24,844
We'd better keep close together.

154
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:26,997
I'm all right, thank you.

155
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,645
- Come on, Jamie.  - Right.

156
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:33,958
Now to concentrate on this, whatever it is.

157
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,436
This hatch must lead somewhere

158
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:38,882
and there must be
some opening mechanism.

159
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:43,358
What was that about
symbolic logic? Any ideas?

160
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:45,445
No, not really.

161
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:48,200
I think it's time
we gave Mr Klieg a chance

162
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:50,642
to show off his archaeological skills.

163
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:55,919
Come on. Right in.

164
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:00,920
Where's Toberman?

165
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:03,077
I sent him to join the others.

166
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:06,364
We do not need protection
now that you are with us.

167
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:08,517
Yes. Well, shall we commence?

168
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:11,440
Everything must be carefully
measured and recorded.

169
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:13,019
What is this room?

170
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:16,861
I don't know. Possibly this is
where the Cybermen are made.

171
00:11:17,747 --> 00:11:19,419
I wonder what this is.

172
00:11:24,107 --> 00:11:27,543
Do you mind? You're in my way.
Just go over there.

173
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:28,946
Oh, fiddle!

174
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:32,338
Could this not be the purpose of the room?

175
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:33,746
Yes?

176
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:38,105
A Cyberman would stand
in that form and be...

177
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:41,541
Well, revitalised.

178
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:44,739
Yes, that's reasonable.

179
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:50,503
These projectors probably meant to fire in
some neuro-electric potential.

180
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:52,979
That's it. I think you're right.

181
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:56,216
Revitalising is just what I need.

182
00:11:58,347 --> 00:12:01,419
Mercy! The Cybermen
must have been giants!/

183
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:15,266
Well?

184
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:19,561
The basis of this code
is binary to digital conversion,

185
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:22,798
with an intervening step involving
a sort of Whitehead logic.

186
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:25,959
When this Bourrier series is complete,
then there is no more to be done.

187
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:28,265
- Yes, but why do it at all?
- Really, Doctor?

188
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:32,045
For an archaeologist, you seem to
be curiously lacking in curiosity.

189
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:35,756
Some things are better left undone
and I have a feeling this is one of them.

190
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:37,678
What do you mean by that?

191
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,962
- It's all too easy, isn't it?  - Easy?

192
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:42,083
I wouldn't call this an easy survey. Would you?

193
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:45,637
Everything is designed to keep their secrets,
whatever they are, insoluble.

194
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:47,922
Insoluble? Oh, I wouldn't say that.

195
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:52,398
Take this mathematical sequence for example.
I'm really no nearer to its solution.

196
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:55,843
I've tried every combination.
It's hardly call that easy.

197
00:12:55,927 --> 00:13:00,125
Yes. Well, what you've done here
is mostly right.

198
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,677
- Thank you (!)
- You see, any progressive series

199
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,997
can be converted into binary notation.

200
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,965
If you take the sum of the integrets

201
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:11,607
and express the result as a power series,

202
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:14,360
then the indices show the basic binary blocks.

203
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,156
Only I wouldn't do it if I were you.
Oh, I really wouldn't do it.

204
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,045
Of course! You're right!

205
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:31,077
(LOW HUMMING)

206
00:13:31,487 --> 00:13:35,719
Look! Sum between limits of one and 91

207
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:39,197
integral into power series... Yes, yes!

208
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,835
Then you differentiate...

209
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,201
You fool! Why couldn't you leave it alone?

210
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:48,964
- What's happening?  - I don't know.

211
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:51,926
Perhaps the Cybermen aren't as
quite dormant as you imagine.

212
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:53,326
Yes, we must find out
what's happened to the others.

213
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:04,017
- Is that all?  - Aye.

214
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:06,018
All except this big button here.
What does that do?

215
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:08,063
I'm not sure, but we'll find out.

216
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,741
I'm going to trace the source
of these shapes.

217
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:13,467
There must be a projector somewhere.

218
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:16,422
- When I give the word, press the button.
- The big one?

219
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,418
Yes. Maybe it works in conjunction with the others.

220
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:21,863
- Right. Ready when you are.
- OK. Go ahead.

221
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:32,538
- Jamie, don't touch that control!
- I already have.

222
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,902
- What's the matter, Doctor?
- Which one was it?

223
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:36,306
Which one what?
