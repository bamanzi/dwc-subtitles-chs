1
00:29:11,407 --> 00:29:13,637
Can we not make a run for it,
Doctor?

2
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:16,719
No. We wouldn't reach the ladder.
It's too risky.

3
00:29:16,807 --> 00:29:18,286
What can we do?

4
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:21,564
Play for time.
Wait for our chance. Leave it to me.

5
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:26,559
Excuse me? May I ask a question?

6
00:29:27,447 --> 00:29:30,484
Why did you submit yourself
to freezing?

7
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,203
You don't have to answer that.

8
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,437
<i>To survive.</i>

9
00:29:36,647 --> 00:29:41,084
<i>Our history computer</i>
<i>has full details of you.</i>

10
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,636
Oh? How?

11
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:46,241
<i>We know of your intelligence.</i>

12
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,124
Oh. Thank you very much.

13
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,764
Ah, yes. The lunar surface.

14
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:53,964
<i>Our machinery had stopped</i>

15
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:57,960
<i>and our supply of replacements</i>
<i>been depleted.</i>

16
00:29:58,127 --> 00:30:00,516
So that's why
you attacked the moonbase.

17
00:30:00,687 --> 00:30:04,077
<i>You had destroyed our first planet</i>

18
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:06,727
<i>and we were becoming extinct.</i>

19
00:30:06,887 --> 00:30:10,163
What does capturing us do?
You'll still become extinct.

20
00:30:10,327 --> 00:30:13,319
<i>We will survive.</i>

21
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:19,440
<i>You will become the first</i>
<i>of a new race of Cybermen.</i>

22
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:23,520
<i>You will return to Earth</i>
<i>and control it.</i>

23
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:25,561
But we're humans. We're not like you.

24
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:28,321
<i>You will be.</i>

25
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:31,283
Oh. No. Keep away!

26
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:32,800
Keep away!

27
00:30:32,887 --> 00:30:34,286
Keep away...!/

28
00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:46,698
It's very quiet down there.

29
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:48,584
Yeah. Too quiet.

30
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:51,818
- Something must have happened.
- How long they been down?

31
00:30:51,907 --> 00:30:53,260
About an hour.

32
00:30:53,347 --> 00:30:55,577
That's too long. I'm going down./

33
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,976
<i>You are a logician.</i>

34
00:30:58,067 --> 00:31:01,184
<i>Our race is also logical.</i>

35
00:31:01,347 --> 00:31:05,101
<i>You will be the leader</i>
<i>of the new race.</i>

36
00:31:05,187 --> 00:31:07,621
You will listen
to my proposals, then?

37
00:31:07,787 --> 00:31:10,665
<i>Yes. We will listen.</i>

38
00:31:10,747 --> 00:31:14,183
<i>But first you will be altered.</i>

39
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:15,906
Altered?

40
00:31:16,067 --> 00:31:18,183
<i>You have fear.</i>

41
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:21,862
<i>We will eliminate fear</i>
<i>from your brain.</i>

42
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:25,781
<i>Yes. You will be the first.</i>

43
00:31:26,307 --> 00:31:29,663
<i>And you will be the next.</i>

44
00:31:29,747 --> 00:31:32,215
No! No! Aagh!

45
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,697
<i>You will be like us.</i>

46
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:45,820
<i>To die is unnecessary.</i>

47
00:31:45,907 --> 00:31:47,738
<i>You will be frozen</i>

48
00:31:47,827 --> 00:31:49,863
<i>and placed in our tombs</i>

49
00:31:49,947 --> 00:31:53,019
<i>until we are ready to use you.</i>

50
00:31:53,107 --> 00:31:56,338
<i>Your lives will be suspended.</i>

51
00:31:56,987 --> 00:31:59,626
<i>Prepare the tombs.</i>

52
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:05,179
They really mean it.
They're going to freeze us.

53
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:07,098
- Not me.
- No, they're coming back.

54
00:32:14,847 --> 00:32:17,725
Come on, you guys. Run for it!/

55
00:32:27,207 --> 00:32:28,560
Jamie!

56
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,399
Look at that smoke.

57
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:31,966
(JAMIE) Victoria!

58
00:32:32,047 --> 00:32:34,003
Come on, Mr Parry. Come on, quick!

59
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:40,402
The Cybermen!
They're right behind us.

60
00:32:51,647 --> 00:32:53,444
When the Doctor's up,
close the hatch!

61
00:32:53,607 --> 00:32:55,837
- OK!
- Stand by!

62
00:32:56,847 --> 00:32:58,678
Oh! Aagh! He's got my leg!

63
00:33:00,447 --> 00:33:02,199
Doctor, come on!

64
00:33:02,287 --> 00:33:04,801
- Come on!
- It's no use.

65
00:33:12,047 --> 00:33:13,719
Jim, close the hatch!

66
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:30,079
(CALLUM) Got him!

67
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:31,566
(BANGING)

68
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:45,038
It was horrible. It was so strong!

69
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:47,118
It's all right.
You're all right now.

70
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:51,640
That was a near thing.
Is anyone missing?

71
00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:55,877
Yes. Klieg and Toberman -
they're still down there!/

72
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,442
Don't open it.
It may be the Cybermen.

73
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:13,676
No. No, it's too soft.

74
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:17,120
- It must be Toberman and Klieg.
- You're crazy.

75
00:34:17,207 --> 00:34:20,483
We can't leave them down there
even if they are killers.

76
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:22,364
They're probably frozen by now.

77
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:26,445
You must let them up.
They must be saved.

78
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:29,325
Yes, they're more dangerous
down there than up here.

79
00:34:29,407 --> 00:34:31,079
What? OK. Jim?

80
00:34:31,247 --> 00:34:32,566
Right.

81
00:34:32,647 --> 00:34:34,080
(KNOCKING)

82
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:35,486
Let her go.

83
00:34:35,647 --> 00:34:37,365
Excuse me, please.

84
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:42,044
Shut it! Shut it quick!

85
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:44,595
- Where's Toberman?
- They've got him.

86
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:48,202
Still think you can form an alliance
with the Cybermen?

87
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:51,040
If only I'd been
in a stronger position to bargain.

88
00:34:51,207 --> 00:34:55,166
- You must be out of your mind.
- You're in no position to bargain.

89
00:34:55,247 --> 00:34:57,078
What are we going to do with them?

90
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,317
I'd feel happier
if they weren't in here.

91
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:01,637
What about the testing room?

92
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,160
Good idea.

93
00:35:03,327 --> 00:35:04,680
- Callum!
- Right.

94
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,086
Mr Klieg?

95
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,486
Miss Kaftan./

96
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:16,519
<i>These humanoids are not like us.</i>

97
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:19,560
<i>They still have fear.</i>

98
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:26,886
<i>Place the Cybermats on the runway.</i>

99
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:35,239
<i>Cybermats will attack.</i>

100
00:36:11,247 --> 00:36:12,600
Oh!

101
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:16,959
I'm on your side, remember?

102
00:36:19,047 --> 00:36:21,641
Hey, why didn't you wake me?

103
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:24,482
I should have been on watch
half an hour ago.

104
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:27,320
- I thought you should rest.
- Why me?

105
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:29,679
No reason really.

106
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:32,801
Oh, I think I know.
Was it because I'm...?

107
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:37,563
Well, if you are 450 years old,
you need a great deal of sleep.

108
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:40,605
Well, that's very considerate
of you, Victoria,

109
00:36:40,687 --> 00:36:44,680
but, between you and me,
I'm really quite lively actually -

110
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,723
all things being considered.

111
00:36:48,527 --> 00:36:50,518
Are you happy with us, Victoria?

112
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:52,165
Yes, I am.

113
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:56,403
At least, I would be
if my father were here.

114
00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:58,045
Yes, I know.

115
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:01,926
I wonder what he'd think
if he could see me now.

116
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:04,237
You miss him very much, don't you?

117
00:37:05,207 --> 00:37:07,562
It's only when I close my eyes.

118
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:10,161
I can still see him standing there.

119
00:37:10,247 --> 00:37:13,557
Before those horrible
Dalek creatures came to the house.

120
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:16,238
He was a very kind man.

121
00:37:16,687 --> 00:37:18,882
I shall never forget him. Never.

122
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:20,480
No, of course you won't.

123
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:24,196
But, you know, the memory of him
won't always be a sad one.

124
00:37:24,287 --> 00:37:26,084
I think it will.

125
00:37:26,247 --> 00:37:28,556
You can't understand,
being so ancient.

126
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,763
- Eh?
- I mean old.

127
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:33,407
You probably
can't remember your family.

128
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:35,717
Oh, yes, I can when I want to.

129
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,445
That's the point.

130
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:40,678
I have to really want to
bring them back in front of my eyes.

131
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:43,804
The rest of the time
they sleep in my mind and I forget.

132
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:47,084
And so will you. Oh, yes, you will.

133
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:50,557
You'll find there's so much else
to think about, to remember.

134
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:54,963
Our lives are different
to anybody else's.

135
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:56,924
That's the exciting thing.

136
00:37:57,007 --> 00:38:00,716
There's nobody in the universe
can do what we're doing.

137
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,039
You must get some sleep,

138
00:38:05,127 --> 00:38:08,403
and let this poor old man
stay awake.

139
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:45,245
Jamie, Victoria, Callum, wake up!

140
00:38:45,327 --> 00:38:47,158
- Wake up!
- What is it?

141
00:38:58,527 --> 00:39:00,279
Callum. Callum.

142
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:02,437
(VICTORIA) Those terrible things.

143
00:39:02,527 --> 00:39:04,836
Don't move, Callum. Don't move.

144
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:13,903
Get back to the controls,
all of you.

145
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:17,218
Don't make any sudden movements.
Parry, wake up.

146
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:21,815
Don't panic.
Come back with us. Steady.

147
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:24,706
We'll all go in the other room
and lock them out.

148
00:39:25,787 --> 00:39:27,106
Aagh!

149
00:39:29,907 --> 00:39:31,625
Let's get out of here.

150
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:33,299
The main doors.

151
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:35,586
No!

152
00:39:35,747 --> 00:39:38,261
Oh! Oh, Doctor, we're trapped!

153
00:39:38,347 --> 00:39:40,417
Back against the controls,
everybody.

154
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:44,700
Here.

155
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:46,539
Give me a hand, quick.

156
00:39:46,627 --> 00:39:48,902
Lay this down on the ground.
Come on!

157
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,466
- Doctor?
- Come on!

158
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,498
Let's blast the filthy things!

159
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,282
You're wasting your time. There are
too many of them! Come back!

160
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:13,518
- There you are.
- What are those creatures?

161
00:40:13,687 --> 00:40:15,040
Well, they're...

162
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:18,484
They're a form of metallic life.

163
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:21,639
They home
on human brainwaves and attack.

164
00:40:22,927 --> 00:40:24,246
Urgh!

165
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:28,885
Are they safe now?

166
00:40:29,047 --> 00:40:32,642
Quite safe now. The power cable
generated an electrical field

167
00:40:32,727 --> 00:40:34,877
that confused
their tiny metal minds.

168
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:37,163
They've had a complete
<i>metal</i> breakdown.

169
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:39,238
- Ooh.
- I'm so sorry, Jamie.

170
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:42,922
What about Klieg and Kaftan?
They've probably been attacked.

171
00:40:43,087 --> 00:40:46,045
- The testing room.
- Come on. Mind your feet.

172
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:51,158
Most ingenious, Doctor.

173
00:40:51,247 --> 00:40:53,761
Now let's see
what you can do against this.

174
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:57,685
Watch out, Doctor!
