1
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:45,519
Aaagh!

2
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,742
- Careful, Doctor!
- It's all right.

3
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:53,819
I think. I think it's all right now.

4
00:14:55,067 --> 00:15:00,300
Yes. You see.
It's just a mock-up, a model.

5
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:03,140
Don't touch that!
That gun may be wired up too.

6
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:04,722
- It's a trap.
- No, I don't think so.

7
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:07,303
It's a testing room for weapons.

8
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:09,557
This is a purely robotic Cyberman.

9
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:12,081
There's no human material in it at all.

10
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,886
It's a target for weapons.

11
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:18,198
Let's get back to the control room
with this poor fellow.

12
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,359
What's that?

13
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:23,563
(JAMIE) Some wee creature
I found on the floor.

14
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:26,999
It's a fossil.

15
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:29,362
Victoria, be careful!
Let me see that.

16
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:35,676
Yes, it's certainly inactive,
but it's not a fossil.

17
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:37,959
Wait a minute.

18
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,879
Yes. Here we are.

19
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:45,080
Yes.

20
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:47,123
It's a Cybermat.

21
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,004
What's a Cybermat?

22
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:52,284
It's one of those.
I'd leave it alone if I were you./

23
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:57,642
I just don't understand this code.

24
00:15:57,727 --> 00:15:59,638
The sequence doesn't make sense.

25
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:01,922
You, a logician, can't understand it?

26
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:04,396
- You must.
- But in the time we have...

27
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:07,365
We have plenty of time.
You will see.

28
00:16:07,527 --> 00:16:10,758
- Lay him down there.
- What has happened to him?

29
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:13,486
There's been an accident.
He's been shot.

30
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,276
Right. We're all here.
Would you all sit down for a moment?

31
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:18,766
Toberman?

32
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:24,005
Mr Klieg?

33
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,476
Leave me alone.
Can't you see I'm working?

34
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:29,320
Have you forgotten
the purpose of this expedition?

35
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:33,275
This directly concerns my expedition.
Kindly take your place.

36
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:42,795
Right.
I'll come straight to the point.

37
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:49,480
I've reluctantly decided to abandon
the expedition and return to Earth.

38
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:52,719
- It's impossible!
- I feel just as strongly about it.

39
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,118
This expedition has been
my dream for many years.

40
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:59,802
Some, like Mr Viner,
said more preparation was needed -

41
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:01,366
more men and equipment.

42
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:06,282
I did not heed their warnings,
and the result is that two have died.

43
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:10,076
I'm sorry, but we must leave
at the first available conjunction.

44
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,079
We'll take back
all we can for further study.

45
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:17,285
But that is my decision
and that is what we must do.

46
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:19,677
- I insist that...!
- My decision is final!

47
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:23,999
We leave when the north hemisphere
is properly tangential,

48
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:27,397
which will be at 18.42.

49
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:30,604
Ah, Captain Hopper.
Can you blast off at 18.42?

50
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:32,006
No.

51
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:35,685
I beg your pardon.
Did I hear you right?

52
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:37,598
You are paid to take orders.

53
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,325
Not impossible ones.

54
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:42,524
It's the fuel pumps.
Someone has balled-up the lot.

55
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,757
- What?
- Or someTHING.

56
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:49,602
Whatever it is, it's nearly wrecked
our chances of leaving this planet./

57
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:01,496
There's no doubt about it.
The major workings lie below.

58
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:05,023
There are metal caverns
down there, all interconnected.

59
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:06,984
If only we can get down to them.

60
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,057
That's it! I've got it!

61
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:15,059
Finally, a Boolean function
of symbolic logic.

62
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:18,025
- Logical, yes, but...
- Everything yields to logic.

63
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:20,621
- Our basic assumption.
- Really.

64
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:23,983
Six, cap, B4...

65
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:27,346
if and only if C

66
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:30,737
is cap function of 2A.

67
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:36,500
I think perhaps your logic
is wearing a little thin.

68
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:39,624
I must have made a mistake.
I'll do it again carefully.

69
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:45,185
Six, cap, B4...

70
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:49,025
if and only if C...

71
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:53,866
is cap faction of... Ah, that's it!

72
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:55,699
2F, not 2A.

73
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,617
(WHIRRING)

74
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:04,946
I've done it! I've done it!

75
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:07,382
- Congratulations!
- But, Doctor, you...

76
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:09,901
Excellent. Now to work.

77
00:19:10,747 --> 00:19:14,342
It'll be extremely cold.
We shall need to put on warm clothing.

78
00:19:14,427 --> 00:19:16,338
Mr Viner, would you get the anoraks?

79
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:19,305
- Are we all going down?
- There's safety in numbers.

80
00:19:19,387 --> 00:19:21,821
- The women as well?
- They will stay up here.

81
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:24,102
In case of trouble,
contact the rocket.

82
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,981
- I'm coming with you.
- But my dear young lady...

83
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:29,376
- You heard me, Professor.
- Victoria.

84
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:31,617
You will be much safer up here.

85
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:34,540
- But, Doctor...
- And much more use to us.

86
00:19:34,627 --> 00:19:38,063
- I don't see...
- By keeping an eye on things.

87
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:39,546
Please.

88
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,743
- All right.
- Thank you.

89
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:45,024
(PARRY) If we're all ready,
I shall lead the descent.

90
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:47,985
Be ready to go back
the instant I give the word.

91
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,378
- You know what to do?
- The hatch?

92
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:56,625
Mr Toberman?

93
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:58,140
He stays with me.

94
00:19:58,307 --> 00:20:00,980
Then I stay here too.

95
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:03,263
Of course. I am being selfish.

96
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:06,817
His strength will be useful to you.
He must go down.

97
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:08,784
Go down, Toberman.

98
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,942
Remember what I said.
Be very careful.

99
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:23,175
(KAFTAN) It seems
we are left alone to wait.

100
00:20:24,227 --> 00:20:28,266
Captain Hopper brought food
from the rocket. You would like some?

101
00:20:28,347 --> 00:20:30,702
Rather! I'm ravenous./

102
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:34,139
We've no time to linger!

103
00:20:34,227 --> 00:20:38,140
It's extremely cold down here,
even with these anoraks.

104
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:40,661
(JAMIE) You obviously knew
what to expect.

105
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:44,420
Well, which way do we go?

106
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:47,305
I don't know. Let's try this one.

107
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:48,706
Yes.

108
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:00,938
Hey, what on Earth?!

109
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:05,146
(PARRY) Behold, gentlemen,
the tombs of the Cybermen.

110
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:08,583
(JAMIE)
Tombs? I don't see any tombs.

111
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:10,100
There, Jamie.

112
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,098
Frozen forever.

113
00:21:13,227 --> 00:21:16,060
All their evil
locked away with them.

114
00:21:16,147 --> 00:21:18,103
And so it must remain.

115
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:21,266
Like a gigantic honeycomb.

116
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:26,865
Like bees waiting for the signal
to arise from their winter sleep.

117
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:29,825
A signal they are never
going to get.

118
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:33,502
We'd better get busy. Everything
must be recorded. It's too cold...

119
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:36,624
Unless we find some way
to warm things up.

120
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:39,898
You have hardly touched your coffee.

121
00:21:39,987 --> 00:21:41,864
It must be cold by now.

122
00:21:42,027 --> 00:21:43,858
You would like some more?

123
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:47,144
No, thank you. I'm much warmer now.

124
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:48,546
That's good.

125
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:50,219
I...

126
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:52,704
feel so sleepy.

127
00:22:04,307 --> 00:22:05,660
(WHIRRING)

128
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:08,658
(CLANG)

129
00:22:08,747 --> 00:22:11,136
- What was that?
- It sounded like the hatch.

130
00:22:15,747 --> 00:22:17,180
It's closed!

131
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:20,065
What's the use?
We're trapped down here now.

132
00:22:20,147 --> 00:22:22,456
We'll never survive in this cold.

133
00:22:22,547 --> 00:22:24,139
Better get back.

134
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,740
Well?

135
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:32,297
It's closed.
What are they playing at up there?

136
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:34,059
Maybe it wasn't them. Where's Jamie?

137
00:22:34,147 --> 00:22:35,899
He went up the ladder to try it.

138
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:39,218
Professor. Professor,
listen to me, for heaven's sake!

139
00:22:40,947 --> 00:22:43,620
The hatch is down.
We're trapped down here.

140
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:46,380
But some of my party
are up there. Are you sure?

141
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:50,016
Of course. You know how heavy it is.
It's down now.

142
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:51,699
We must do something!

143
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,255
I give us a couple of hours
in here at most.

144
00:22:54,427 --> 00:22:57,146
Mr Klieg doesn't seem
to be very worried.

145
00:22:57,227 --> 00:22:58,865
No, I'm not, Doctor.

146
00:22:58,947 --> 00:23:01,415
It won't open
and I can't make them hear.

147
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:04,385
There is an easy way
out of our situation.

148
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,106
- You've found something?
- You forget logic.

149
00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:09,940
If it closes,
it can be opened - from here.

150
00:23:10,027 --> 00:23:13,064
Conveniently labelled
in symbolic logic, I notice.

151
00:23:13,147 --> 00:23:16,981
Right. Are we ready?
I shall now operate the sequence.

152
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,024
If it is the opening device.

153
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:22,145
It's an opening device
of some kind, Doctor.

154
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:24,821
I don't know
how you can be so blasted calm!

155
00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:26,659
I'll see if it works.

156
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:29,699
Go ahead!

157
00:23:32,507 --> 00:23:34,338
Nothing happening out here!

158
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:35,906
It doesn't work.

159
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:50,980
Water!

160
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:53,706
- It's getting warmer.
- The ice is melting.

161
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:55,539
Hey, look behind you!

162
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:02,826
Look!

163
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:04,818
Look at the honeycomb.

164
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:07,418
There's something inside.

165
00:24:07,507 --> 00:24:10,180
They're... They're Cybermen.

166
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:11,666
Jamie, come back!

167
00:24:17,507 --> 00:24:19,145
It is them.

168
00:24:19,227 --> 00:24:21,536
Gentlemen, they are perfect.

169
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,096
This is unique in archaeology.

170
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:30,106
No!

171
00:24:30,187 --> 00:24:32,826
No! They're moving!

172
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,418
We must shut it down.

What are you doing?
Keep away from that!

176
00:25:00,747 --> 00:25:02,066
No.

177
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:03,944
- What are you doing?
- Keep away!

178
00:25:04,107 --> 00:25:07,179
- Keep away from those controls.
- No!

179
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:10,906
Viner!

180
00:25:11,147 --> 00:25:12,660
Viner!

181
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,976
Viner. You've killed him!

182
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:17,659
- He's mad.
- Jamie!

183
00:25:32,787 --> 00:25:35,506
Haydon dead, now Viner.

184
00:25:35,587 --> 00:25:37,578
What kind of man are you?

185
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:39,146
Back! Keep back!

186
00:25:40,627 --> 00:25:42,345
Let's see what happens.

187
00:25:42,427 --> 00:25:47,455
As the Professor says, this is
a unique archaeological event.

188
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:50,266
It would be such a pity to miss it.

189
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,499
(LOUD WHIRRING)/

190
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:06,785
Doctor, I have a feeling
that man's planned it all.

191
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:09,017
He knew
that wouldn't open the hatch.

192
00:26:09,107 --> 00:26:11,223
- So did I, Jamie.
- You knew?

193
00:26:11,307 --> 00:26:13,423
I wanted to know what he was up to.

194
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:16,146
- And now you know, Doctor.
- We know nothing.

195
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:19,380
This is the action of a lunatic.

196
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:23,346
Lunatic? Not at all, Professor.
A necessary detail, that's all.

197
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:25,099
But why?

198
00:26:25,187 --> 00:26:28,623
Logic, my dear Professor,
logic and power.

199
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,982
On Earth,
the Brotherhood of Logicians

200
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:33,786
is the greatest man intelligence
ever assembled.

201
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:36,142
But that's not enough.
We need power -

202
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,536
power to put our ability
into action.

203
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:42,666
The Cybermen have this power.
I have come to find it and use it.

204
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:46,057
So that was your motive
in financing my expedition!

205
00:26:46,227 --> 00:26:51,381
Precisely. Your lack
of administration made it ideal.

206
00:26:51,547 --> 00:26:53,583
You think the Cybermen
will help you?

207
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:56,102
Of course.
I shall be their resurrector.

208
00:26:56,827 --> 00:26:58,306
Look!

209
00:28:04,627 --> 00:28:06,822
- Keep still!
- Behind you!

210
00:28:06,907 --> 00:28:09,785
That thing! It's come alive!

211
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:13,701
You are so simple. You expect to
take me in with a trick like that!

212
00:28:13,787 --> 00:28:15,618
It's true! Look!

213
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:18,938
- Will nothing keep you still?
- Will you please look?!

214
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:17,779
(BEEPING)

215
00:28:19,027 --> 00:28:21,416
Any more trouble
and I'll take drastic steps.

216
00:28:21,507 --> 00:28:23,941
We won't allow
a little girl to interfere!

217
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:28,097
Aaagh!

218
00:28:35,587 --> 00:28:38,147
(BEEPING WINDS DOWN...)

219
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:40,536
(..AND STOPS)

220
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,546
What is it?

221
00:28:55,627 --> 00:28:58,903
I think it's their leader,
their Controller, Jamie.

222
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:06,797
<i>(CONTROLLER) You belong to us.</i>

223
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:11,125
<i>You shall be like us.</i>
