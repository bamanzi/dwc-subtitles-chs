<b>The Tomb of the Cybermen</b>
(Whopix fan edit)

2
00:00:41,227 --> 00:00:43,980
Stand by. Everybody down.

3
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:37,982
to open the doors.

4
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:41,935
Miss Kaftan, I must remind you
that I am the leader of the...

5
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:02,302
- What happened?  - I don't know.

6
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:07,177
Well, one thing for sure, he's not going to
collect 50 pounds from you or anybody else.

7
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:09,542
- Quiet. Quiet a minute.  - What's that?

8
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:11,538
Sounded like an engine.

9
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:13,026
(WHOOSHING)

10
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:15,941
- Something came down there! Behind that ...
- OK, Viner. Slow down.

11
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:19,177
- I'll take care of this. Jim!
- OK. I've got it!

12
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:38,699
(LOW VOICES)

13
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:41,698
Hold it right there, friend.

14
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,023
If you put it like that, I certainly will.

15
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:46,939
Hear that, Professor? English.

16
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:48,938
(PARRY) Yes. All right, Hopper.

17
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:51,060
Thank you.

18
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:53,138
Who are you and where are you from?

19
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,298
And you'd better have a good story.

20
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:57,059
Maybe you'll not get one.

21
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,582
Listen, fella.
We're not playing games.

22
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:03,137
- You'd better listen to him.
- What's been happening over here?

23
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:10,923
He was killed the moment you men  appeared.

24
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:13,017
Ah. And you think we did it?

25
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:16,019
Oh no, I can assure you, we had nothing
to do with the death of this man.

26
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:19,418
He appears to have been electrocuted.

27
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,376
Trying to open these doors, perhaps?

28
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:25,061
- He seems to know all the answers.
- A wiseguy!

29
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:28,541
I think this fellow must be
a member of a rival expedition.

30
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:30,060
(DOCTOR) Expedition?

31
00:03:30,147 --> 00:03:33,344
We've tried to keep it secret.
Unsuccessfully, now it appears.

32
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:35,622
Archaeologist written all over him.

33
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,778
- Really? Does it show?  - You see?

34
00:03:37,947 --> 00:03:40,780
It's impossible to keep a secret
in the scientific world.

35
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,786
- Doctor, what do you mean?
- Tell them, go on, Doctor, tell them.

36
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:46,135
No, not until they tell us
the purpose of their expedition.

37
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:48,616
This is an archaeological expedition.

38
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:52,416
We are searching the universe
for the last remains of the Cybermen.

39
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:56,226
Cybermen? You mean to say they came from here?

40
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:58,263
Of course. Telos was their home.

41
00:03:58,427 --> 00:04:00,224
This is the entrance to their city.

42
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,459
We know they died out centuries ago,

43
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,459
what we don't know is why they died out.

44
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:08,620
Callum, Rogers! Get him back to the rocket.
I'll be with you in a minute.

45
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:11,904
That's that. Are you coming back
to the rocket with me, Professor?

46
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:14,785
- What for?
- You're not going on with this, are you?

47
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:16,301
I don't know if these people had
anything to do with it or not,

48
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:21,175
but one of my men was just been killed.
You're not paying that kind of money.

49
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,781
- Yes, I suppose that's quite true.
- You think it over.

50
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:26,700
Come on, let's go.
We'll wait for you at the ship.

51
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:29,865
The problem, I take it,
is to open these doors, right?

52
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:32,056
- Ha! Brilliant.  - That is the problem.

53
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,661
And we would prefer it, if you return
to wherever you came from.

54
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:37,580
- Not very friendly, are they?
- Do as he says.

55
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:41,296
That became impossible the moment
that name was mentioned - Cybermen.

56
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:43,105
Cybermen? What are they?

57
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:44,843
I knew they're here on the same quest!

58
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,543
No one would come here for any other reason?

59
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:48,186
- We must stay!  - Doctor!

60
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,906
Must we? I don't like
the look of those things at all.

61
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:52,404
We shall stay and help you with your research.

62
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,104
Perhaps we don't want help.

63
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:56,975
That's just it. You obviously do.
Now I'm sure we can agree.

64
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:59,546
- I can open those doors for you.
- It's our problem!

65
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:02,778
Can I suggest you take this ridiculous
expedition of yours off this planet!

66
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:05,177
It seems to me we have
as much right here as you have.

67
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:07,799
Of course you have!
Mr Klieg, must I remind you again...

68
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,699
that you do not speak for this expedition?
I am its leader.

69
00:05:10,787 --> 00:05:13,626
You and Miss Kaftan
are only here on sufferance.

70
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:16,221
- Thank you. And whose money is paying
for the hire of that rocket?
- (KAFTAN) Mine!

71
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:19,060
I thought I made it clear
that your financial support...

72
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:22,105
did not entitle you to a say
in the running of this expedition!

73
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,417
Of course. It was quite clear.

74
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:26,418
Was it not, Eric?

75
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:29,704
Of course.
No one questions your leadership.

76
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:32,222
Good. That's all settled.

77
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:35,936
- And now we shall open these doors.
- What...?

78
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:39,059
- Careful, man!  - Doctor!

79
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,660
Perfectly safe now.

80
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:52,863
- You'll be killed!  - Don't touch him!

81
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:00,506
- It's beyond my strength.
- Let me, Doctor.

82
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:07,297
I've not had much exercise lately.

83
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:10,857
Quite. I think here is a gentleman
who could open these doors for us.

84
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:14,298
He is my servant.
I will not have him risk his life.

85
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:18,486
Surely it was just for such a contingency like this
that you insisted we bring him with us.

86
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:21,106
There's no danger now.
Unless he's afraid.

87
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:23,098
No, no. He's not afraid.

88
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,023
- Come on.  - No. Wait!

89
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:53,905
I would be very careful in there
if I were you.

90
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:56,262
Why weren't Toberman killed?
Why weren't you killed?

91
00:06:56,347 --> 00:07:00,306
The poor fellow who died drained
all the electricity out of his body.

92
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,139
It's perfectly safe to go in now.

93
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:03,819
We're wasting time.

94
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:06,946
Of course. After you, Professor.

95
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,499
But I'd still...

96
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:16,376
I'd still be very careful if I were you.
Very careful indeed.

97
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:19,104
Come on. Let's join them.

98
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,265
Come on, Victoria.

99
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,897
You look very nice in that dress.

100
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:30,217
Thank you.
Don't you think it's a bit...?

101
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:33,299
Short? I shouldn't worry.
Look at Jamie's.

102
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,742
I'll have you know that... Oh, aye.

103
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:38,466
Come along. Let's go and see
what the others are doing.

104
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:51,419
(VICTORIA)
Mercy! Just look at this place.

105
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:53,896
These controls are of earlier dynasties.

106
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,785
Not so early. Look, John...

107
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,540
I'm quite capable of making
my own deductions! Thank you.

108
00:07:58,627 --> 00:07:59,946
All right.

109
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,978
Be careful. There might be danger.

110
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:06,025
Don't worry, with Toberman to guard me.

111
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:08,940
What is more important is
to keep an eye on these strangers.

112
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:10,783
- I tried to...!
- Do not raise your voice.

113
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:12,783
You will achieve nothing by shouting.

114
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:16,860
You look after the Doctor
and I will watch the girl.

115
00:08:17,027 --> 00:08:19,825
- And the Scots boy?
- Leave him to Toberman.

116
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,986
Eh, Toberman?

117
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:26,026
- But you will be careful and discreet. Understand?
- I understand.

118
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:29,896
- Did you ever see the like of it, Doctor?
- Not exactly, Jamie, but very nearly.

119
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:33,303
(PARRY) Now that we're all here...

120
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:38,381
Now that we're all here, we'd better
take stock of the situation.

121
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,662
This appears to be a dead end.

122
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:43,536
The only way out is through that hatch.

123
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,105
- Are there no doors?
- No. Apart from the entrance.

124
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:48,278
- And the other two, of course.
- Two other doors?

125
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:52,201
Yes. One in that section
and one in that section over there.

126
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:55,563
Activated, I imagine, by this
simple logical system here.

127
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:58,081
Here we are, I think.

128
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:04,677
(BLEEPING)

129
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,201
Yes, splendid! A simple logical gate.

130
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:16,038
Doctor, you seem to be
very familiar with this place.

131
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:19,517
Not really. It's all based on symbolic logic.

132
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:21,359
The same as you use in computers.

133
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:24,484
The opening mechanism of this door -
an OR gate, as you call it.

134
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,684
Yes, I can see that, but how did you know
in the first place?

135
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,758
I use my own special technique.

136
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:32,315
Really? And may we know what that is?

137
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:35,636
Keeping my eyes open
and my mouth shut.

138
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:40,237
We are too many to explore together.
I think we'd better divide up.

139
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:44,240
If you, Mr Viner, would take that door with...

140
00:09:44,327 --> 00:09:46,636
- Jamie.  - Jamie and Mr Haydon.

141
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:49,605
Mr Klieg, the Doctor and myself
will be a party.

142
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,599
- What about us?
- I think the women should better to remain here.

143
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:54,917
Rubbish! We can make a party.

144
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:58,716
Certainly. With Toberman to guard us,
we need fear no one.

145
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,877
Mr Klieg, will you take them with you?

146
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,117
- I prefer to stay here.  - As you wish.

147
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:05,926
Mr Viner, will you go along with the women?

148
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:09,841
- If you like.
- Get back to the spacecraft by 16.30.

149
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:12,157
You all know the temperature drop at night,

150
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:15,920
so we'll meet back here at 16.25.
If anyone is missing...

151
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:18,556
that gives us an hour to look for them
before we have to leave.

152
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:21,878
Come on then. We might as well
try that opening over there.

153
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:24,844
We'd better keep close together.

154
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:26,997
I'm all right, thank you.

155
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,645
- Come on, Jamie.  - Right.

156
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:33,958
Now to concentrate on this, whatever it is.

157
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,436
This hatch must lead somewhere

158
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:38,882
and there must be
some opening mechanism.

159
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:43,358
What was that about
symbolic logic? Any ideas?

160
00:10:43,887 --> 00:10:45,445
No, not really.

161
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:48,200
I think it's time
we gave Mr Klieg a chance

162
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:50,642
to show off his archaeological skills.

163
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:55,919
Come on. Right in.

164
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:00,920
Where's Toberman?

165
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:03,077
I sent him to join the others.

166
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:06,364
We do not need protection
now that you are with us.

167
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:08,517
Yes. Well, shall we commence?

168
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:11,440
Everything must be carefully
measured and recorded.

169
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:13,019
What is this room?

170
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:16,861
I don't know. Possibly this is
where the Cybermen are made.

171
00:11:17,747 --> 00:11:19,419
I wonder what this is.

172
00:11:24,107 --> 00:11:27,543
Do you mind? You're in my way.
Just go over there.

173
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:28,946
Oh, fiddle!

174
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:32,338
Could this not be the purpose of the room?

175
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:33,746
Yes?

176
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:38,105
A Cyberman would stand
in that form and be...

177
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:41,541
Well, revitalised.

178
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:44,739
Yes, that's reasonable.

179
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:50,503
These projectors probably meant to fire in
some neuro-electric potential.

180
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:52,979
That's it. I think you're right.

181
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:56,216
Revitalising is just what I need.

182
00:11:58,347 --> 00:12:01,419
Mercy! The Cybermen
must have been giants!/

183
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:15,266
Well?

184
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:19,561
The basis of this code
is binary to digital conversion,

185
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:22,798
with an intervening step involving
a sort of Whitehead logic.

186
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:25,959
When this Bourrier series is complete,
then there is no more to be done.

187
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:28,265
- Yes, but why do it at all?
- Really, Doctor?

188
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:32,045
For an archaeologist, you seem to
be curiously lacking in curiosity.

189
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:35,756
Some things are better left undone
and I have a feeling this is one of them.

190
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:37,678
What do you mean by that?

191
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,962
- It's all too easy, isn't it?  - Easy?

192
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:42,083
I wouldn't call this an easy survey. Would you?

193
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:45,637
Everything is designed to keep their secrets,
whatever they are, insoluble.

194
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:47,922
Insoluble? Oh, I wouldn't say that.

195
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:52,398
Take this mathematical sequence for example.
I'm really no nearer to its solution.

196
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:55,843
I've tried every combination.
It's hardly call that easy.

197
00:12:55,927 --> 00:13:00,125
Yes. Well, what you've done here
is mostly right.

198
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,677
- Thank you (!)
- You see, any progressive series

199
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,997
can be converted into binary notation.

200
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,965
If you take the sum of the integrets

201
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:11,607
and express the result as a power series,

202
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:14,360
then the indices show the basic binary blocks.

203
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,156
Only I wouldn't do it if I were you.
Oh, I really wouldn't do it.

204
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,045
Of course! You're right!

205
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:31,077
(LOW HUMMING)

206
00:13:31,487 --> 00:13:35,719
Look! Sum between limits of one and 91

207
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:39,197
integral into power series... Yes, yes!

208
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,835
Then you differentiate...

209
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,201
You fool! Why couldn't you leave it alone?

210
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:48,964
- What's happening?  - I don't know.

211
00:13:49,047 --> 00:13:51,926
Perhaps the Cybermen aren't as
quite dormant as you imagine.

212
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:53,326
Yes, we must find out
what's happened to the others.

213
00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:04,017
- Is that all?  - Aye.

214
00:14:04,107 --> 00:14:06,018
All except this big button here.
What does that do?

215
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:08,063
I'm not sure, but we'll find out.

216
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,741
I'm going to trace the source
of these shapes.

217
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:13,467
There must be a projector somewhere.

218
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:16,422
- When I give the word, press the button.
- The big one?

219
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,418
Yes. Maybe it works in conjunction with the others.

220
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:21,863
- Right. Ready when you are.
- OK. Go ahead.

221
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:32,538
- Jamie, don't touch that control!
- I already have.

222
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,902
- What's the matter, Doctor?
- Which one was it?

223
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:36,306
Which one what?

224
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:45,519
Aaagh!

225
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,742
- Careful, Doctor!
- It's all right.

226
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:53,819
I think. I think it's all right now.

227
00:14:55,067 --> 00:15:00,300
Yes. You see.
It's just a mock-up, a model.

228
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:03,140
Don't touch that!
That gun may be wired up too.

229
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:04,722
- It's a trap.
- No, I don't think so.

230
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:07,303
It's a testing room for weapons.

231
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:09,557
This is a purely robotic Cyberman.

232
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:12,081
There's no human material in it at all.

233
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,886
It's a target for weapons.

234
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:18,198
Let's get back to the control room
with this poor fellow.

235
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,359
What's that?

236
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:23,563
(JAMIE) Some wee creature
I found on the floor.

237
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:26,999
It's a fossil.

238
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:29,362
Victoria, be careful!
Let me see that.

239
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:35,676
Yes, it's certainly inactive,
but it's not a fossil.

240
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:37,959
Wait a minute.

241
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,879
Yes. Here we are.

242
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:45,080
Yes.

243
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:47,123
It's a Cybermat.

244
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:49,004
What's a Cybermat?

245
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:52,284
It's one of those.
I'd leave it alone if I were you./

246
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:57,642
I just don't understand this code.

247
00:15:57,727 --> 00:15:59,638
The sequence doesn't make sense.

248
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:01,922
You, a logician, can't understand it?

249
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:04,396
- You must.
- But in the time we have...

250
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:07,365
We have plenty of time.
You will see.

251
00:16:07,527 --> 00:16:10,758
- Lay him down there.
- What has happened to him?

252
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:13,486
There's been an accident.
He's been shot.

253
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,276
Right. We're all here.
Would you all sit down for a moment?

254
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:18,766
Toberman?

255
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:24,005
Mr Klieg?

256
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,476
Leave me alone.
Can't you see I'm working?

257
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:29,320
Have you forgotten
the purpose of this expedition?

258
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:33,275
This directly concerns my expedition.
Kindly take your place.

259
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:42,795
Right.
I'll come straight to the point.

260
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:49,480
I've reluctantly decided to abandon
the expedition and return to Earth.

261
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:52,719
- It's impossible!
- I feel just as strongly about it.

262
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,118
This expedition has been
my dream for many years.

263
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:59,802
Some, like Mr Viner,
said more preparation was needed -

264
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:01,366
more men and equipment.

265
00:17:01,527 --> 00:17:06,282
I did not heed their warnings,
and the result is that two have died.

266
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:10,076
I'm sorry, but we must leave
at the first available conjunction.

267
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,079
We'll take back
all we can for further study.

268
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:17,285
But that is my decision
and that is what we must do.

269
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:19,677
- I insist that...!
- My decision is final!

270
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:23,999
We leave when the north hemisphere
is properly tangential,

271
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:27,397
which will be at 18.42.

272
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:30,604
Ah, Captain Hopper.
Can you blast off at 18.42?

273
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:32,006
No.

274
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:35,685
I beg your pardon.
Did I hear you right?

275
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:37,598
You are paid to take orders.

276
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,325
Not impossible ones.

277
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:42,524
It's the fuel pumps.
Someone has balled-up the lot.

278
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,757
- What?
- Or someTHING.

279
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:49,602
Whatever it is, it's nearly wrecked
our chances of leaving this planet./

280
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:01,496
There's no doubt about it.
The major workings lie below.

281
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:05,023
There are metal caverns
down there, all interconnected.

282
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:06,984
If only we can get down to them.

283
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,057
That's it! I've got it!

284
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:15,059
Finally, a Boolean function
of symbolic logic.

285
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:18,025
- Logical, yes, but...
- Everything yields to logic.

286
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:20,621
- Our basic assumption.
- Really.

287
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:23,983
Six, cap, B4...

288
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:27,346
if and only if C

289
00:18:27,427 --> 00:18:30,737
is cap function of 2A.

290
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:36,500
I think perhaps your logic
is wearing a little thin.

291
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:39,624
I must have made a mistake.
I'll do it again carefully.

292
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:45,185
Six, cap, B4...

293
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:49,025
if and only if C...

294
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:53,866
is cap faction of... Ah, that's it!

295
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:55,699
2F, not 2A.

296
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,617
(WHIRRING)

297
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:04,946
I've done it! I've done it!

298
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:07,382
- Congratulations!
- But, Doctor, you...

299
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:09,901
Excellent. Now to work.

300
00:19:10,747 --> 00:19:14,342
It'll be extremely cold.
We shall need to put on warm clothing.

301
00:19:14,427 --> 00:19:16,338
Mr Viner, would you get the anoraks?

302
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:19,305
- Are we all going down?
- There's safety in numbers.

303
00:19:19,387 --> 00:19:21,821
- The women as well?
- They will stay up here.

304
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:24,102
In case of trouble,
contact the rocket.

305
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,981
- I'm coming with you.
- But my dear young lady...

306
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:29,376
- You heard me, Professor.
- Victoria.

307
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:31,617
You will be much safer up here.

308
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:34,540
- But, Doctor...
- And much more use to us.

309
00:19:34,627 --> 00:19:38,063
- I don't see...
- By keeping an eye on things.

310
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:39,546
Please.

311
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,743
- All right.
- Thank you.

312
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:45,024
(PARRY) If we're all ready,
I shall lead the descent.

313
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:47,985
Be ready to go back
the instant I give the word.

314
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,378
- You know what to do?
- The hatch?

315
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:56,625
Mr Toberman?

316
00:19:56,707 --> 00:19:58,140
He stays with me.

317
00:19:58,307 --> 00:20:00,980
Then I stay here too.

318
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:03,263
Of course. I am being selfish.

319
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:06,817
His strength will be useful to you.
He must go down.

320
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:08,784
Go down, Toberman.

321
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,942
Remember what I said.
Be very careful.

322
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:23,175
(KAFTAN) It seems
we are left alone to wait.

323
00:20:24,227 --> 00:20:28,266
Captain Hopper brought food
from the rocket. You would like some?

324
00:20:28,347 --> 00:20:30,702
Rather! I'm ravenous./

325
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:34,139
We've no time to linger!

326
00:20:34,227 --> 00:20:38,140
It's extremely cold down here,
even with these anoraks.

327
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:40,661
(JAMIE) You obviously knew
what to expect.

328
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:44,420
Well, which way do we go?

329
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:47,305
I don't know. Let's try this one.

330
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:48,706
Yes.

331
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:00,938
Hey, what on Earth?!

332
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:05,146
(PARRY) Behold, gentlemen,
the tombs of the Cybermen.

333
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:08,583
(JAMIE)
Tombs? I don't see any tombs.

334
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:10,100
There, Jamie.

335
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,098
Frozen forever.

336
00:21:13,227 --> 00:21:16,060
All their evil
locked away with them.

337
00:21:16,147 --> 00:21:18,103
And so it must remain.

338
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:21,266
Like a gigantic honeycomb.

339
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:26,865
Like bees waiting for the signal
to arise from their winter sleep.

340
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:29,825
A signal they are never
going to get.

341
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:33,502
We'd better get busy. Everything
must be recorded. It's too cold...

342
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:36,624
Unless we find some way
to warm things up.

343
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:39,898
You have hardly touched your coffee.

344
00:21:39,987 --> 00:21:41,864
It must be cold by now.

345
00:21:42,027 --> 00:21:43,858
You would like some more?

346
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:47,144
No, thank you. I'm much warmer now.

347
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:48,546
That's good.

348
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:50,219
I...

349
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:52,704
feel so sleepy.

352
00:22:08,747 --> 00:22:11,136
- What was that?
- It sounded like the hatch.

353
00:22:15,747 --> 00:22:17,180
It's closed!

354
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:20,065
What's the use?
We're trapped down here now.

355
00:22:20,147 --> 00:22:22,456
We'll never survive in this cold.

356
00:22:22,547 --> 00:22:24,139
Better get back.

357
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,740
Well?

358
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:32,297
It's closed.
What are they playing at up there?

359
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:34,059
Maybe it wasn't them. Where's Jamie?

360
00:22:34,147 --> 00:22:35,899
He went up the ladder to try it.

361
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:39,218
Professor. Professor,
listen to me, for heaven's sake!

362
00:22:40,947 --> 00:22:43,620
The hatch is down.
We're trapped down here.

363
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:46,380
But some of my party
are up there. Are you sure?

364
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:50,016
Of course. You know how heavy it is.
It's down now.

365
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:51,699
We must do something!

366
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,255
I give us a couple of hours
in here at most.

367
00:22:54,427 --> 00:22:57,146
Mr Klieg doesn't seem
to be very worried.

368
00:22:57,227 --> 00:22:58,865
No, I'm not, Doctor.

369
00:22:58,947 --> 00:23:01,415
It won't open
and I can't make them hear.

370
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:04,385
There is an easy way
out of our situation.

371
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,106
- You've found something?
- You forget logic.

372
00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:09,940
If it closes,
it can be opened - from here.

373
00:23:10,027 --> 00:23:13,064
Conveniently labelled
in symbolic logic, I notice.

374
00:23:13,147 --> 00:23:16,981
Right. Are we ready?
I shall now operate the sequence.

375
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,024
If it is the opening device.

376
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:22,145
It's an opening device
of some kind, Doctor.

377
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:24,821
I don't know
how you can be so blasted calm!

378
00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:26,659
I'll see if it works.

379
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:29,699
Go ahead!

380
00:23:32,507 --> 00:23:34,338

It doesn't work.

382
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:50,980
Water!

383
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:53,706
- It's getting warmer.
- The ice is melting.

384
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:55,539
Hey, look behind you!

385
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:02,826
Look!

386
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:04,818
Look at the honeycomb.

387
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:07,418
There's something inside.

388
00:24:07,507 --> 00:24:10,180
They're... They're Cybermen.

389
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:11,666
Jamie, come back!

390
00:24:17,507 --> 00:24:19,145
It is them.

Gentlemen, they are perfect.

392
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,096
This is unique in archaeology.

393
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:30,106
No!

394
00:24:30,187 --> 00:24:32,826
No! They're moving!

395
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,418
We must shut it down.

- Keep away!

- Keep away from those controls.
- No!

- Jamie!

Back! Keep back!

Let's see what happens.

410
00:25:42,427 --> 00:25:47,455
As the Professor says, this is
a unique archaeological event.

411

It would be such a pity to miss it.

(LOUD WHIRRING)/

413
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:06,785
Doctor, I have a feeling
that man's planned it all.

414
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:09,017
He knew
that wouldn't open the hatch.

415
00:26:09,107 --> 00:26:11,223
- So did I, Jamie.
- You knew?

416
00:26:11,307 --> 00:26:13,423
I wanted to know what he was up to.

417
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:16,146
- And now you know, Doctor.
- We know nothing.

418
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:19,380
This is the action of a lunatic.

419
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:23,346
Lunatic? Not at all, Professor.
A necessary detail, that's all.

420
00:26:23,507 --> 00:26:25,099
But why?

421
00:26:25,187 --> 00:26:28,623
Logic, my dear Professor,
logic and power.

ever assembled.

424
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:36,142
But that's not enough.
We need power -

425
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,536
power to put our ability
into action.

426
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:42,666
The Cybermen have this power.
I have come to find it and use it.

427
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:46,057
So that was your motive
in financing my expedition!

428
00:26:46,227 --> 00:26:51,381
Precisely. Your lack
of administration made it ideal.

429
00:26:51,547 --> 00:26:53,583
You think the Cybermen
will help you?

430
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:56,102
Of course.
I shall be their resurrector.

431
00:26:56,827 --> 00:26:58,306

take me in with a trick like that!

Why did you submit yourself
to freezing?

453

You don't have to answer that.

454
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,437
<i>To survive.</i>

<i>and our supply of replacements</i>
<i>been depleted.</i>

So that's why
you attacked the moonbase.

00:30:00,687 --> 00:30:04,077
<i>You had destroyed our first planet</i>

464

<i>and we were becoming extinct.</i>

00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:30,079
(CALLUM) Got him!

513
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:31,566
(BANGING)

514
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:45,038
It was horrible. It was so strong!

515
00:33:45,127 --> 00:33:47,118
It's all right.
You're all right now.

516
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:51,640
That was a near thing.
Is anyone missing?

517
00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:55,877
Yes. Klieg and Toberman -
they're still down there!/

518
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,442
Don't open it.
It may be the Cybermen.

519
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:13,676
No. No, it's too soft.

520
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:17,120
- It must be Toberman and Klieg.
- You're crazy.

521
00:34:17,207 --> 00:34:20,483
We can't leave them down there
even if they are killers.

522
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:22,364
They're probably frozen by now.

523
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:26,445
You must let them up.
They must be saved.

524
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:29,325
Yes, they're more dangerous
down there than up here.

525
00:34:29,407 --> 00:34:31,079
What? OK. Jim?

526
00:34:31,247 --> 00:34:32,566
Right.

527
00:34:32,647 --> 00:34:34,080
(KNOCKING)

528
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:35,486
Let her go.

529
00:34:35,647 --> 00:34:37,365
Excuse me, please.

530
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:42,044
Shut it! Shut it quick!

531
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:44,595
- Where's Toberman?
- They've got him.

532
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:48,202
Still think you can form an alliance
with the Cybermen?

533
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:51,040
If only I'd been
in a stronger position to bargain.

534
00:34:51,207 --> 00:34:55,166
- You must be out of your mind.
- You're in no position to bargain.

535
00:34:55,247 --> 00:34:57,078
What are we going to do with them?

536
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,317
I'd feel happier
if they weren't in here.

537
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:01,637
What about the testing room?

538
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,160
Good idea.

539
00:35:03,327 --> 00:35:04,680
- Callum!
- Right.

540
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,086
Mr Klieg?

541
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,486
Miss Kaftan./

542
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:16,519
<i>These humanoids are not like us.</i>

543
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:19,560
<i>They still have fear.</i>

544
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:26,886
<i>Place the Cybermats on the runway.</i>

545
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:35,239
<i>Cybermats will attack.</i>

546
00:36:11,247 --> 00:36:12,600
Oh!

547
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:16,959
I'm on your side, remember?

548
00:36:19,047 --> 00:36:21,641
Hey, why didn't you wake me?

549
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:24,482
I should have been on watch
half an hour ago.

550
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:27,320
- I thought you should rest.
- Why me?

551
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:29,679
No reason really.

552
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:32,801
Oh, I think I know.
Was it because I'm...?

553
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:37,563
Well, if you are 450 years old,
you need a great deal of sleep.

554
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:40,605
Well, that's very considerate
of you, Victoria,

555
00:36:40,687 --> 00:36:44,680
but, between you and me,
I'm really quite lively actually -

556
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,723
all things being considered.

557
00:36:48,527 --> 00:36:50,518
Are you happy with us, Victoria?

558
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:52,165
Yes, I am.

559
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:56,403
At least, I would be
if my father were here.

560
00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:58,045
Yes, I know.

561
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:01,926
I wonder what he'd think
if he could see me now.

562
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:04,237
You miss him very much, don't you?

563
00:37:05,207 --> 00:37:07,562
It's only when I close my eyes.

564
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:10,161
I can still see him standing there.

565
00:37:10,247 --> 00:37:13,557
Before those horrible
Dalek creatures came to the house.

566
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:16,238
He was a very kind man.

567
00:37:16,687 --> 00:37:18,882
I shall never forget him. Never.

568
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:20,480
No, of course you won't.

569
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:24,196
But, you know, the memory of him
won't always be a sad one.

570
00:37:24,287 --> 00:37:26,084
I think it will.

571
00:37:26,247 --> 00:37:28,556
You can't understand,
being so ancient.

572
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,763
- Eh?
- I mean old.

573
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:33,407
You probably
can't remember your family.

574
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:35,717
Oh, yes, I can when I want to.

575
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,445
That's the point.

576
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:40,678
I have to really want to
bring them back in front of my eyes.

577
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:43,804
The rest of the time
they sleep in my mind and I forget.

578
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:47,084
And so will you. Oh, yes, you will.

579
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:50,557
You'll find there's so much else
to think about, to remember.

580
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:54,963
Our lives are different
to anybody else's.

581
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:56,924
That's the exciting thing.

582
00:37:57,007 --> 00:38:00,716
There's nobody in the universe
can do what we're doing.

583
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,039
You must get some sleep,

584
00:38:05,127 --> 00:38:08,403
and let this poor old man
stay awake.

585
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:45,245
Jamie, Victoria, Callum, wake up!

586
00:38:45,327 --> 00:38:47,158
- Wake up!
- What is it?

587
00:38:58,527 --> 00:39:00,279
Callum. Callum.

588
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:02,437
(VICTORIA) Those terrible things.

589
00:39:02,527 --> 00:39:04,836
Don't move, Callum. Don't move.

590
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:13,903
Get back to the controls,
all of you.

591
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:17,218
Don't make any sudden movements.
Parry, wake up.

592
00:39:19,347 --> 00:39:21,815
Don't panic.
Come back with us. Steady.

593
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:24,706
We'll all go in the other room
and lock them out.

594
00:39:25,787 --> 00:39:27,106
Aagh!

595
00:39:29,907 --> 00:39:31,625
Let's get out of here.

596
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:33,299
The main doors.

597
00:39:34,267 --> 00:39:35,586
No!

598
00:39:35,747 --> 00:39:38,261
Oh! Oh, Doctor, we're trapped!

599
00:39:38,347 --> 00:39:40,417
Back against the controls,
everybody.

600
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:44,700
Here.

601
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:46,539
Give me a hand, quick.

602
00:39:46,627 --> 00:39:48,902
Lay this down on the ground.
Come on!

603
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,466
- Doctor?
- Come on!

604
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,498
Let's blast the filthy things!

605
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,282
You're wasting your time. There are
too many of them! Come back!

606
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:13,518
- There you are.
- What are those creatures?

607
00:40:13,687 --> 00:40:15,040
Well, they're...

608
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:18,484
They're a form of metallic life.

609
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:21,639
They home
on human brainwaves and attack.

610
00:40:22,927 --> 00:40:24,246
Urgh!

611
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:28,885
Are they safe now?

612
00:40:29,047 --> 00:40:32,642
Quite safe now. The power cable
generated an electrical field

613
00:40:32,727 --> 00:40:34,877
that confused
their tiny metal minds.

614
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:37,163
They've had a complete
<i>metal</i> breakdown.

615
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:39,238
- Ooh.
- I'm so sorry, Jamie.

616
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:42,922
What about Klieg and Kaftan?
They've probably been attacked.

617
00:40:43,087 --> 00:40:46,045
- The testing room.
- Come on. Mind your feet.

618
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:51,158
Most ingenious, Doctor.

619
00:40:51,247 --> 00:40:53,761
Now let's see
what you can do against this.

620
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:57,685
Watch out, Doctor!

621
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:08,161
<i>The humanoids</i>
<i>must first be destroyed.</i>

622
00:41:08,807 --> 00:41:13,437
<i>You will re-enter cells</i>
<i>to conserve energy.</i>

623
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:11,006
Keep back!

624
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:13,126
Your gun.

625
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:19,598
You've killed him, you murderer.

626
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:22,235
No. He is fortunate. I spared him.

627
00:41:22,407 --> 00:41:25,479
- You missed him.
- Silence! I could have killed him.

628
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,525
- Shall I kill them now?
- No, that will not be necessary.

629
00:41:28,607 --> 00:41:30,598
The Cybermen
will have a use for them.

630
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:34,964
You will make excellent
experimental specimens.

631
00:41:35,127 --> 00:41:37,436
Oh, let me help him, please!

632
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:39,406
No tricks.

633
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:41,876
Still think you can bargain
with the Cybermen?

634
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:44,117
Certainly. This time on our terms.

635
00:41:52,247 --> 00:41:54,681
I wish to speak to the Controller.

636
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:58,965
I wish to speak to the Controller!

637
00:42:05,807 --> 00:42:08,765
<i>He is now prepared.</i>

638
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:11,603
<i>Release him.</i>

639
00:42:21,347 --> 00:42:22,826
They're coming.

640
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:27,423
Now, gentlemen, you will see how
I shall use the power of the Cybermen.

641
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:30,499
Use, maybe, but you'll never
control the Cybermen.

642
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:32,544
- Behind you.
- Stop!

643
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:35,262
You know what this can do to you.

644
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:41,706
Toberman, it is good
that you are back.

645
00:42:42,467 --> 00:42:43,786
Watch them.

646
00:42:47,387 --> 00:42:50,584
- Doctor, he seems er...
- Yes, Jamie, yes.

647
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:52,978
I shall let you be revitalised.

648
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:54,944
To survive, it must be now.

649
00:42:59,067 --> 00:43:01,376
Come forward. Slowly.

650
00:43:01,467 --> 00:43:03,105
- Be careful.
- Leave this to me.

651
00:43:14,607 --> 00:43:17,326
You are absolutely crazy
to trust them!

652
00:43:17,407 --> 00:43:18,726
You think so?

653
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:22,925
Then perhaps you and your colleagues
had better join him. Go on. Go on!

654
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:26,923
- The girl stays with us.
- No!

655
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:28,406
She is our hostage.

656
00:43:32,927 --> 00:43:34,519
Close the hatch.

657
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:38,518
You seem to be in trouble.

658
00:43:39,847 --> 00:43:42,361
<i>The energy...</i>

659
00:43:42,447 --> 00:43:45,280
<i>levels...are...low.</i>

660
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:49,316
<i>We...will...survive.</i>

661
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:53,082
<i>You will help us.</i>

662
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:56,882
<i>You will...help...us...</i>

663
00:43:57,047 --> 00:43:58,719
Yes. Yes, certainly.

664
00:43:58,807 --> 00:44:02,322
- Jamie, Professor.
- You're not going to help them?

665
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:04,602
You can't support these creatures!

666
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:06,564
I think it best. Come on.

667
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,046
Come along.

668
00:44:08,127 --> 00:44:09,446
That's it.

669
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:19,400
<i>Do...you...understand...</i>
<i>the...machine?</i>

670
00:44:19,487 --> 00:44:21,000
Yes. One moment.

671
00:44:21,087 --> 00:44:24,284
Have you taken leave of your senses?
Let's help Victoria.

672
00:44:24,367 --> 00:44:26,039
In a moment, Jamie.

673
00:44:27,407 --> 00:44:29,204
(DOCTOR) Are you ready?

674
00:44:38,607 --> 00:44:41,804
<i>We will survive.</i>

675
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,878
<i>We will sur...</i>

676
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:47,517
Now, where would you rather
have him - in or out of there?

677
00:44:47,907 --> 00:44:50,501
Oh, I see what you mean.

678
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:53,545
Only we must make sure
that he stays in there.

679
00:44:55,887 --> 00:44:59,482
Do you really believe you can bargain
with those terrible Cybermen?

680
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:02,127
That is our concern, not yours.

681
00:45:02,207 --> 00:45:04,084
I'm talking to him, not you.

682
00:45:04,147 --> 00:45:06,622
They will have to agree to our plan.

683
00:45:07,807 --> 00:45:09,559
We shouldn't have touched it.

684
00:45:09,647 --> 00:45:11,763
Turn it off. It's out of control.

685
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:15,196
(NOISE DIES DOWN)

686
00:45:20,887 --> 00:45:22,400
It's taken over.

687
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:23,806
I think not.

688
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,436
There must be some sort
of internal timing mechanism.

689
00:45:27,527 --> 00:45:30,439
Jamie, I hope you made
those ropes secure.

690
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,405
The King of Beasties
couldnae get out of that.

691
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:45,235
Jamie, remind me to give you
a lesson in tying knots.

692
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:47,318
What do you hope to gain from this?

693
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:50,365
- That does not concern you.
- They might as well know.

694
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:53,245
We are going to build
a better world.

695
00:45:53,327 --> 00:45:55,238
(CALLUM) Better? But who for?

696
00:45:56,927 --> 00:45:58,883
I told you to watch the door.

697
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,400
Aagh!

698
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:01,886
Aagh!

699
00:46:03,287 --> 00:46:04,606
Toberman.

700
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,886
Victoria.

701
00:46:12,527 --> 00:46:15,837
- <i>You have done well.</i>
- Toberman!

702
00:46:15,927 --> 00:46:17,360
<i>Silence.</i>

703
00:46:17,447 --> 00:46:21,281
<i>He is now under our control.</i>

704
00:46:21,367 --> 00:46:23,881
<i>Open the tombs.</i>

705
00:46:23,967 --> 00:46:25,286
No.

706
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:29,798
You have broken your promise.

707
00:46:29,967 --> 00:46:33,039
<i>Cybermen do not promise.</i>

708
00:46:33,567 --> 00:46:36,798
<i>Such ideas have no value.</i>

709
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:38,686
<i>Open.</i>

710
00:46:39,807 --> 00:46:41,126
No.

711
00:47:01,447 --> 00:47:03,961
<i>That gun will not harm me.</i>

712
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:08,846
Aagh!

713
00:47:18,327 --> 00:47:20,124
Look what they've done.

714
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:23,677
You are not like them. You're a man
like us. You must help us.

715
00:47:24,807 --> 00:47:27,605
He has killed Kaftan.
You must help us.

716
00:47:28,927 --> 00:47:32,886
<i>You will report to the surface.</i>

717
00:47:55,887 --> 00:47:58,845
(UNINTELLIGIBLE NOISES)

718
00:48:06,607 --> 00:48:08,199
Jamie, the hatch!

719
00:48:10,527 --> 00:48:11,926
The gun, Jamie!

720
00:48:31,527 --> 00:48:33,199
There's another one!

721
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:37,476
(CRASHING)

722
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:40,080
Are there any more?

723
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,158
No. I'll close the hatch.

724
00:48:42,247 --> 00:48:44,807
Wait a minute.
We'd better go down there.

725
00:48:44,887 --> 00:48:47,355
- Not again!
- It's the only way to make sure.

726
00:48:47,447 --> 00:48:50,325
- I'll go too.
- No. Stay and look after Victoria.

727
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,804
I'll take somebody else.

728
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,559
Toberman.

729
00:48:58,647 --> 00:49:01,320
You see what these creatures
have done to you?

730
00:49:01,407 --> 00:49:05,685
They've tried to make you like them.
Do you understand?

731
00:49:06,327 --> 00:49:09,603
They've tried to make you
their slave. They want to use you.

732
00:49:09,687 --> 00:49:13,282
They are evil. Think of Kaftan.

733
00:49:13,447 --> 00:49:16,644
- Evil!
- They must be destroyed, you see.

734
00:49:16,727 --> 00:49:18,638
Evil must be destroyed.

735
00:49:18,727 --> 00:49:20,319
Now, come.

736
00:49:20,407 --> 00:49:21,726
Destroyed!

737
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:24,120
Come on.

738
00:49:25,207 --> 00:49:26,526
Come on!

739
00:49:35,287 --> 00:49:36,879
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

740
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:39,276
- Doctor, the gun.
- I shan't need that.

741
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:41,879
Should have taken it.

742
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:44,800
- Aagh!
- Poor Mr Callum. How are you?

743
00:49:44,887 --> 00:49:46,639
I can't move my arm.

744
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:01,639
Move quietly.

745
00:50:01,727 --> 00:50:03,558
They're all dormant, see?

746
00:50:09,247 --> 00:50:10,566
Evil!

747
00:50:10,727 --> 00:50:14,242
No! Quietly. They're only asleep.

748
00:50:14,327 --> 00:50:18,161
They're not frozen yet.
You watch them. I have things to do.

749
00:50:19,087 --> 00:50:20,679
Now, let me see.

750
00:50:21,407 --> 00:50:22,726
Yes.

751
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:27,242
The cryostat! You're freezing them!

752
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:29,046
Klieg!

753
00:50:34,087 --> 00:50:36,203
No! You'll wake them up!

754
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:38,323
That is exactly my intention.

755
00:50:38,407 --> 00:50:40,682
You still don't understand, do you?

756
00:50:40,847 --> 00:50:42,644
Their Controller is dead.

757
00:50:42,727 --> 00:50:46,356
Now I shall control them.
They will do what I say.

758
00:50:46,927 --> 00:50:48,246
You see, Doctor.

759
00:50:48,407 --> 00:50:51,763
Yours is the privilege
to witness for the first time

760
00:50:51,847 --> 00:50:56,045
the union between mass power
and my absolute intelligence.

761
00:50:57,807 --> 00:50:59,365
Who is that?

762
00:51:00,487 --> 00:51:01,886
Come out.

763
00:51:04,287 --> 00:51:06,596
Come out or I shall kill this man!

764
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,366
Oh, it's you.

765
00:51:12,367 --> 00:51:14,562
Go to that wall, all of you.

766
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,846
All of you!

767
00:51:24,887 --> 00:51:26,206
No.

768
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:30,966
I have a better idea,
a much better idea.

769
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:33,561
I shall leave you to the Cybermen.

770
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:36,682
I'm sure
they'll have some use for you.

771
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:38,885
Or parts of you!

772
00:51:45,407 --> 00:51:47,284
(KLIEG SCREAMS)

773
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:05,085
Quick, Jamie!
These two levers together.

774
00:52:05,847 --> 00:52:08,964
- I can't shift this one.
- What? Trip that first.

775
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,397
Last time they were frozen
for five centuries.

776
00:53:01,207 --> 00:53:03,084
This time it must be forever.

777
00:53:29,487 --> 00:53:31,159
Oh, Doctor!

778
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:34,444
Here we are, Victoria,
safe and sound. Close the hatch.

779
00:53:42,727 --> 00:53:44,206
There we are.

780
00:53:46,247 --> 00:53:47,646
Now then.

781
00:53:50,407 --> 00:53:54,036
The best thing about a machine
that makes sense -

782
00:53:54,807 --> 00:53:58,243
you can very easily
make it turn out nonsense.

783
00:54:00,287 --> 00:54:03,643
- I think you'd better go outside.
- What are you going to do?

784
00:54:03,727 --> 00:54:06,195
I'm going
to re-electrify the main doors.

785
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:10,121
Only this time I'm going to include
the hatch and the control panel.

786
00:54:10,207 --> 00:54:13,438
Anyone touching any of them
will get a considerable shock.

787
00:54:13,527 --> 00:54:16,166
A fatal one. Now, everyone outside.

788
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:20,716
Please take him with you.
I shall be glad to see him outside.

789
00:54:24,557 --> 00:54:26,787
There we are. That's done.

790
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:31,510
We just have to close the main doors
and the circuit is complete.

791
00:54:31,597 --> 00:54:33,508
Thank goodness for that.

792
00:54:36,197 --> 00:54:37,516
Doctor.

793
00:54:37,757 --> 00:54:39,110
Doctor!

794
00:54:41,917 --> 00:54:43,270
Jamie...

795
00:54:44,237 --> 00:54:46,592
You go that way. I'll go this way.

796
00:54:47,037 --> 00:54:49,073
That gives us more of a chance.

797
00:54:49,157 --> 00:54:51,796
When I say run, run.

798
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:01,396
Run!

799
00:55:04,237 --> 00:55:05,590
Quickly!

800
00:55:09,117 --> 00:55:11,392
Stop! We'll get a shock.

801
00:55:12,077 --> 00:55:15,308
We must find something to insulate.
That shoring timber.

802
00:55:15,997 --> 00:55:17,350
Hurry up!

803
00:55:17,437 --> 00:55:19,997
Hurry up, he's coming!

804
00:55:22,237 --> 00:55:24,705
We must keep him inside

805
00:55:24,797 --> 00:55:26,913
or all our work will be wasted.

806
00:55:26,997 --> 00:55:30,034
- I can't hold mine!
- You must!

807
00:55:30,117 --> 00:55:31,630
Toberman!

808
00:55:36,277 --> 00:55:38,586
<i>We must survive.</i>

809
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,789
<i>We must survive.</i>

810
00:55:41,957 --> 00:55:43,276
You are evil.

811
00:55:43,437 --> 00:55:45,951
- Toberman, come away!
- You'll get killed, man!

812
00:55:46,117 --> 00:55:48,711
They shall never pass Toberman.

813
00:55:50,197 --> 00:55:51,915
The door is closed.
