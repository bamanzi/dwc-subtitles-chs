1
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:28,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:38,711
Come in, my child. You have no alternative.

3
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,980
Do not be afraid.

4
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:49,930
Are... are you?

5
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:52,377
I am Padmasambhava.

6
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,800
I'm sorry to intrude. I know this room
is meant to be private, but...

7
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,930
You need my help. Is that not so?

8
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,160
Oh yes. Please, the Doctor...

9
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,355
One moment child.

10
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:06,555
- But...   - Shh.

11
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:08,850
What is it?

12
00:01:11,377 --> 00:01:13,310
The courtyard is empty.

13
00:01:13,844 --> 00:01:14,970
Courtyard?

14
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,750
I must do what I am compelled to do.

15
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,530
What's that?

16
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:23,777
Come closer.

17
00:01:30,244 --> 00:01:35,222
Look. See.

18
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:40,200
It's one of those
horrible creatures.

19
00:01:40,644 --> 00:01:42,566
- A Yeti.  - Indeed.

20
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:45,750
But you have not seen it.

21
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,311
She must have had some reason, 
I mean why would she run off like that?

22
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,066
Her motives were not clear to me, Mr Jamie.

23
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,600
Oh headstrong, that's what she is.

24
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,150
No... no... no!

25
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:33,490
All right, Travers, you're quite safe.

26
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:37,377
- Doctor?   - Yes.

27
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:40,700
What happened? Oh, my head.

28
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,266
Just relax, you're safe, in the monastery.

29
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:46,333
Monastery?

30
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:48,866
What happened? Where did you go to?

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,190
Was it the Yeti?

32
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,866
No, no, not the Yeti. It was a...

33
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:56,044
Something else, it was a light.

34
00:02:56,444 --> 00:03:00,466
A blinding... white light and a noise...

35
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,977
A piercing noise that went through my head...
I couldn't stand it...

36
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:09,533
Then I... I can't remember anymore.

37
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:11,430
You spoke of a pyramid.

38
00:03:11,644 --> 00:03:12,511
Pyramid?

39
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,333
Yes, at the gates when you returned.

40
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,311
Pyramid? No, no.

41
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,533
I left the monastery, then um... then...

42
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,733
It's no use, my mind's a complete blank.

43
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:29,866
You just rest.

44
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,511
- Ah!   - What is it?

45
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:32,820
No !

46
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:36,288
We are taught that it is better
to share a memory of fear.

47
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,422
Evil. A feeling of evil.

48
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,244
- Like um... shadow on my mind.   - Yes.

49
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,511
I felt as though I was going to drown.

50
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:51,066
But where did this happen?

51
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,488
I... I don't know, I can't remember.

52
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,488
Oh, I'm tired, so tired.

53
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,111
You just rest, you'll feel better.

54
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:04,866
Poor fellow he's completely exhausted.

55
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,466
- What does he mean a shadow...?   
- Wait. We'll just let him sleep.

56
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,644
What could it be, this evil of which he speaks?

57
00:04:11,244 --> 00:04:12,622
What was that?

58
00:04:13,222 --> 00:04:14,777
The Yeti! The Yeti!

59
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:18,066
Khrisong, what's happening?

60
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,330
The yeti have broken in! You are safe here.

61
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,070
But Victoria, where is she?

62
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:25,570
Who can tell? But she will be found.
She must be stopped.

63
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:28,111
Doctor, is there nothing we can do?

64
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,690
- Khrisong
- Forgive me, Songsten,

65
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:31,644
I have failed to defend the monastery.

66
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:35,170
Failed? No. This disaster was written.

67
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:37,800
Man cannot alter his destiny.

68
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,066
I should have obeyed you, my Abbot.

69
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,133
My desire to fight these creatures was foolish,

70
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,777
but I will defend you with my life.

71
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:46,711
Abbot, I fear for Rinchen's safety.

72
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,370
- Is he not here?  - No.

73
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,290
He would not seek safety.

74
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:53,066
He is so sure that the girl is responsible.

75
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,377
- He is still searching for her?  - Yes.

76
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:57,066
- Find her!
- If it is not too late.

77
00:04:57,244 --> 00:04:58,622
The Yeti! They are turning back.

78
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:00,711
Then you are safe for the moment. 
Ralpachan, come with me.

79
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,800
Stop! Stop!

80
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:14,422
She-devil, wherever you are, call off these monsters.

81
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,630
Spare us!

82
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,711
Oh, no. Oh, no.

83
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:27,910
Aaahhh!

84
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,377
He's dead.

85
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,844
The monastery of Detsen is accursed.

86
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:20,866
Now it is complete. Now the monks will leave.

87
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:29,177
By nightfall the monastery will be emptied,
the mountain yours.

88
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:35,466
Will this then be your final command?

89
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,733
Will you then be content?

90
00:06:42,377 --> 00:06:45,356
I do not understand,

91
00:06:45,356 --> 00:06:49,822
but I will continue to serve.

92
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,066
And now we must consider the problem
of you and your friends.

93
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:05,755
The Doctor is not easily frightened,
like my poor monks.

94
00:07:06,422 --> 00:07:11,400
Therefore my child you will assist me.

95
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:15,777
Together we will make sure that he leaves.

96
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,755
Come closer.

97
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:32,530
This is what you will do.

98
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:35,866
This is the courtyard and
we are here, to the south.

99
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,288
- I see Thomni, so here lies north.
- That is so.

100
00:07:38,377 --> 00:07:40,155
What are those readings again, Jamie

101
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:42,066
- Jamie, the readings?  - What? What?

102
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,400
- The readings?
- I'm sorry, I was thinking of Victoria.

103
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:46,422
Yes I know, but there is
nothing we can do about her.

104
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:48,644
- Two ninety-seven, Doctor.
- Two ninety-seven.

105
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,244
Now that will give us a bearing roughly there.

106
00:07:52,777 --> 00:07:54,844
Does your science help us, Doctor?

107
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,066
No! We want another bearing, say, from there.

108
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,933
And where those two cross,
that'll be where the transmissions are coming from.

109
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,488
- But that won't tell us why.   - Why?

110
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,511
Yes, what is the purpose behind all this.

111
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,066
That's what we have to find out, eh Jamie?

112
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,377
- Doctor?   - Are you feeling better?

113
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:11,266
Better? What are we doing in here? What's happened?

114
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:12,977
You had a spot of trouble on the mountain.

115
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:14,806
- Trouble?
- Aye, with the Yeti no doubt.

116
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:17,377
Funny, I don't remember.
Sorry, I'm a bit confused.

117
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:18,977
Well you sounded it, with
all that talk about...

118
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:21,630
Yes, I'm... I'm sure it'll
all come back to you in time.

119
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,422
Yes, with the headache I've got, no wonder I ...

120
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,755
... can't remember anything.
I think I'll get a bit of fresh air.

121
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:29,460
Why is this door locked?

122
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,244
Do not blame yourself, Khrisong, death is inevitable.

123
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:36,466
Sambhutar, Ghentan, take up our brother.

124
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:40,022
We will take him with us on our journey.

125
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:43,400
There will be a time to mourn our brother.

126
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,733
Put to the test I ran and hid like a mountain rabbit.

127
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:47,377
I'm not fit to be called a warrior.

128
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:50,360
We must lead out our brothers
before more of them are destroyed.

129
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:52,353
Gather what is needed, my brothers.

130
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:55,533
Soon it will
be the hour for meditation, then we must depart.

131
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:57,310
What of the strangers, master Abbott?

132
00:08:57,444 --> 00:08:59,690
They will be taken with us to a place of safety.

133
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,222
But the girl is lost.

134
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,540
Khrisong and his warriors will find her.

135
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:05,340
And the Master? What of Padmasambhava?

136
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,311
His powers are great, he will remain.

137
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,500
The holy ghanta.

138
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,540
- Child, how came you...?  - Shh!

139
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,220
She has entered the Sanctum.

140
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,977
- Then let me...  - Silence.

141
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,644
See, she is about to speak.

142
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:37,860
- This is a time of much danger.
- Padmasambhava

143
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:48,066
I have chosen to speak to you myself
through the lips of this maiden.

144
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:55,066
She bears the holy ghanta.
Bear it away to safe keeping.

145
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:59,555
Treat this child with kindness.

146
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:06,066
She and the strangers are innocent
of any malice towards you.

147
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:10,911
Their wish is but to help you against the Yeti.

148
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:18,244
But in my wisdom I tell you there is no help.

149
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,911
Detsen must be abandoned.

150
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:30,288
When the wind destroys the nest,
so the bird will build another.

151
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,230
- But what of you Master.  - Go.

152
00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:34,022
With my blessing.

153
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,355
- But Master.  - Do not question.

154
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:41,200
I will remain here to the end.

155
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:44,800
Will a day come for our return to Detsen?

156
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,444
Take her to rest.

157
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,444
Ralpachan, release the strangers.

158
00:10:55,644 --> 00:10:57,066
Bid them make ready.

159
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:04,622
It is time for prayer. The last time at Detsen.

160
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:06,960
Come, my brothers.

161
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,500
You are released.

162
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,377
I should jolly well think so! 
What the devil do you think you're up to!

163
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:24,830
You must prepare to leave with us.

164
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,066
I shall have a short few words to say
to the Abbot before I go anywhere.

165
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,440
Never mind about that! Have you found Victoria yet?

166
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,740
- She is safe. Khrisong is with her.
- Ah good.

167
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:40,533
Are you recovered? Child?

168
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,377
There you are, I've been worried sick.
Where have you been?

169
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:46,600
Victoria? What have you done to her?

170
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,888
Doctor! Doctor, I think she's ill!

171
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:49,910
Let me see.

172
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,800
- Doctor!   - Yes, Victoria.

173
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,311
There is great danger. You must take me away!

174
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,355
Take me away! Take me away!

175
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,555
Yes, yes of course.

176
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:00,311
Victoria, what's happened? Tell us?

177
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,900
What's the matter with her?
Victoria, it's me, Jamie.

178
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,511
- How long has she been like this?
- Doctor!

179
00:12:09,822 --> 00:12:12,688
- Yes, Victoria.
- There is great danger.

180
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,911
You must take me away!
Take me away! Take me away!

181
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,933
The child is still in a state of trance.

182
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,422
Still! What do you mean?

183
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,720
She spoke to us with the voice of the Master.

184
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:24,680
Then she did reach the holy sanctum.

185
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,555
What are you talking about?

186
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,130
She was certain that Padmasambhava
would recognise the Doctor.

187
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,850
- Recognise the Doctor?
- Yes he has been here before.

188
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:35,310
But that was three hundred years ago.
It's the same man!

189
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:40,000
Khrisong, the Abbot Songsten wishes us
to join our brothers in prayer.

190
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:42,533
Very well. You will prepare
to leave. Get Mr Travers ready.

191
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,840
He is in the courtyard.

192
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:46,888
Come, Thomni, to prayer.

193
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,755
Khrisong, will you forgive me?

194
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,022
We have both of us strayed
from the path of obedience.

195
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,066
Jamie, there is something I have to do.

196
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:59,160
Right. Hey why are we whispering?

197
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,266
It's my voice. She reacts to my voice.

198
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,133
Oh it's that hypnotism thing.
Can you not do anything about it?

199
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,000
Yes I can, but I need more information now.

200
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,688
- You wait here.
- Where are you going?

201
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:10,755
I'm going to see a very old friend.

202
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:25,666
Oh Intelligence. You promised to release me,

203
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:33,650
yet still I feel your grasp upon this frail body. Why?

204
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:40,520
What is happening? This was not your plan.

205
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:45,420
But if you continue to expand.

206
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:54,777
I have brought the world to its end.

207
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,733
Come in, Doctor.

208
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,580
Good to look upon your face again? So many years...

209
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:32,400
Padmasambhava, so it's true.

210
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:38,266
I have been kept alive so many years,

211
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:43,640
but now our time left is very very short.

212
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:48,390
Listen carefully, perhaps you can...

213
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,066
Kept alive? I don't understand.

214
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,410
- I didn't know, I didn't realise...
- What?

215
00:14:58,111 --> 00:15:00,311
Try to tell me.

216
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:06,686
Intelligence... formless in space...

217
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,800
I astral travelled...

218
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:13,711
I see, you've made mental contact with this intelligence.

219
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:17,466
It used my mind... it controls my body...

220
00:15:17,577 --> 00:15:19,733
- But why?  - Experiment...

221
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:22,800
Wished material form.

222
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:28,444
Ah yes, it said... I believed... experiment...

223
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:34,377
but now... help... you must help me.

224
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,533
Yes, of course I will help you. But...

225
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,222
But first you must tell me things.

226
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,755
Why are the monks been driven away?

227
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,666
What is the purpose of these robots, the Yeti?

228
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:53,370
Where is their control?
Padmasambhava? Padmasambhava?

229
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,060
I wish there was something I could do.

230
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,622
- What on earth was that?
- Oh, it was just an idea.

231
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,950
Doctor! There is great danger.

232
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,511
You must take me away!
Take me away! Take me away!

233
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:43,315
You've got to do something.

234
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:45,555
Did you find out what you wanted to know?

235
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,800
Not about Victoria, no.
But I found some very interesting clues

236
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,310
- ... as to what's been happening.
- Oh, never mind about that!

237
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,340
It's Victoria you ought to be worrying about.

238
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,066
Yes. Yes, you're quite right.
Victoria must come first.

239
00:16:57,355 --> 00:16:59,711
Trouble is I really need more information.

240
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:02,822
However, I'll just have to take a chance.

241
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,888
It may just be simple post hypnotic suggestion.

242
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,666
- On the other hand...   - Yes?

243
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:09,555
It may be something worse.

244
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,311
What if it is?

245
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,177
Well let's just hope it isn't.

246
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:24,333
- Victoria.
- Doctor! There is great danger.

247
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,311
- You must take me away! ...  - Yes, Victoria.

248
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,200
Listen to me.  You've been taken away.

249
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,133
You're no longer in the monastery. 
You're safe in the TARDIS.

250
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:39,800
Now do you understand. You're safe... in the TARDIS.

251
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,266
Yes. Look at me. Look at my eyes.

252
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:53,244
You're feeling tired, very sleepy.

253
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:58,355
Drift away, let yourself drift away into sleep.

254
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:12,311
Deeper... deeper... sleep...
sleep... sleep... sleep.

255
00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:16,920
- Oh, not you Jamie!   - Aye, what?

256
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,666
So far so good.

257
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,577
Hey. I never knew you could do
that sort of thing.

258
00:18:20,755 --> 00:18:24,555
No, neither did the person who hypnotised Victoria.

259
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,066
What now?

260
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:29,520
Well, I'm tempted to ask her what happened,

261
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:32,030
but I don't think I dare probe too deeply.

262
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:34,955
The important thing is to get rid of this implanted fear.

263
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,266
- It's growing every minute.
- What if you can't?

264
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,622
We shall just have to do as she asks and take her away.

265
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,622
- If we don't...  - Yes?

266
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,377
- She'll go out of her mind.   - What?

267
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,355
Well, that's the object of the exercise,

268
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,400
to get us away from the monastery.

269
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:50,777
But I'm not beaten that easily.

270
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,066
- Hey, you're taking an awful risk!  
- I know what I'm doing, Jamie.

271
00:18:56,444 --> 00:19:01,688
Victoria. Now, Victoria, you can hear my voice, can't you?

272
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:04,290
- Yes.  - Oh, good.

273
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,866
Now I'm going to take you a little way back in the past, Victoria.

274
00:19:09,422 --> 00:19:11,622
You are in the cell with Thomni.

275
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:15,606
- Do you understand?  - Yes.

276
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,666
Good. Now you're going to forget everything after that.

277
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,244
You went to sleep. Is that clear?

278
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:27,930
- Umm.  - Good.

279
00:19:28,777 --> 00:19:35,088
Jamie and I have come back to the monastery
and you are in the meeting room with us.

280
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:40,333
You're feeling happy, but a little tired.
Do you understand?

281
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:42,666
- Yes.  - Good.

282
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:48,066
Now when I count three, you're going to wake up.

283
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,500
One... two... three.

284
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:58,066
Oh, ooh. Ooh dear, I must have dropped off.

285
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,244
Yes, I believe you did. I've got work to do.

286
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:10,888
What are you grinning at?

287
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:13,422
Travers!

288
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:16,846
- Travers!  - Yes, Doctor.

289
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:18,940
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, much better thanks.

290
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,711
Look, I've been taking a look up the mountain.
Those robots are still there.

291
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:24,066
They're just standing, not moving. I don't like it!

292
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:27,933
Yes, I think things are coming to a head.

293
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,244
What are they up to? What are they waiting for?

294
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,955
Instructions!

295
00:20:32,577 --> 00:20:36,644
Travers, can you remember any more of
what happened to you on the mountain?

296
00:20:36,755 --> 00:20:38,600
I'm afraid not, my mind's a complete blank.

297
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,622
Are you prepared to risk it again?

298
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,733
- I thought we're supposed to clear out.
- Yes well,

299
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:45,377
the monks are, but I want to get back up the mountain.

300
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,777
One more bearing and I shall know where the control centre is.

301
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,666
- I see, you want me to help you.
- Yes, if you will.

302
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:50,933
What about your young friends?

303
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,466
Well they're leaving with the monks,

304
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,444
but I want to get out of here before anyone sees us. Will you help?

305
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,510
- All right, I'm on.
- Oh, good, come on.

306
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,080
What's the matter?

307
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,066
I don't know. I've got a feeling I've done this before.

308
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,330
Now, what do you want me to do?

309
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,733
I want you to stay here and take some readings.

310
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,066
Those Yeti are not transmitting.

311
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:32,480
I'm going over there to stir things up a bit.

312
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,866
I don't understand that thing, you'd better let me go.

313
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,100
Oh no, it's far too dangerous.
I can't ask you to take that sort of risk.

314
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,488
Rot, I can take care of myself.

315
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:44,400
Now, wish me luck.

316
00:21:45,244 --> 00:21:46,660
No wait!

317
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:56,800
That's odd.

318
00:21:58,755 --> 00:22:01,090
You got your readings? Because if you've got the reading...

319
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:03,540
Yes.

320
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:05,200
What's up?

321
00:22:10,155 --> 00:22:12,200
- Is there any sign?
- No, every room is empty.

322
00:22:12,377 --> 00:22:13,850
Mr. Travers and the Doctor are nowhere to be found.

323
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,360
It's as you wished. The monastery is deserted.

324
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,800
This is well. I will ask a final blessing
of our Master, Padmasambhava,

325
00:22:20,926 --> 00:22:22,000
then we will depart.

326
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,244
- Padmasambhava.
- Try not to think about it.

327
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:25,600
- I.. I.. I think...  - Doctor!

328
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,355
Khrisong, I have found the control.

329
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:29,200
It is too late, Doctor, I can no longer help you.

330
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,420
But you don't understand!
It's here! In the monastery.

331
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,540
What? That's impossible!

332
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,060
But the monastery is empty, we are all here.

333
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,700
Are we? Are we all here?

334
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,222
- The Master!   - Songsten is with him!

335
00:22:41,377 --> 00:22:44,044
Then he is in great danger!
Stay where you are. All of you.

336
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,581
I remember.

337
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:50,422
Songsten, the Yeti, on the mountain.

338
00:22:50,822 --> 00:22:53,520
- Yes, yes, it's all coming back to me.
- Tell us.

339
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:56,577
There was ... this cave...
