1
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:28,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,177
Jamie, when you captured this creature,
you must have dislodged it's control unit.

3
00:01:11,377 --> 00:01:12,777
Then it must still be lying out there.

4
00:01:13,022 --> 00:01:14,280
Precisely!

5
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,260
Where are you going?

6
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,066
To have a look outside the gates.
I want that unit. Come on, Jamie.

7
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,244
- No! I will not allow it.
- But why not?

8
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:23,230
I trust no one to leave the monastery.
You say this creature is not a real Yeti.

9
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,288
- It's metal. It's been made.
- And sent against us. Why?

10
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:28,644
Why does someone wish harm to the monks of Detsen.

11
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,280
I will trust no stranger until these questions are answered.

12
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,444
Ah, but we're on your side! Have we not convinced you yet?

13
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,070
I am convinced of nothing.

14
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,880
The Doctor knows all about this sort of thing.
Why not let him help you?

15
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,680
Well if you don't trust us at least send Thomni,
or one of your other warriors.

16
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:44,490
No! I will not allow the gates to be opened!

17
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,800
- If you want us to help...
- I do not need your help!

18
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:48,533
Thomni, guard them!

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,022
Oh dear, a very obstinate man.

20
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,266
Yes, well that's that I suppose.
Nothing we can do about it now.

21
00:01:56,044 --> 00:02:00,533
Um, well I... I think I'll just go
and get a bit of shut-eye. Good night all.

22
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,688
- Ralpachan.   - Yes, Khrisong.

23
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:14,222
Stand guard at the gate.
No one is to leave the monastery.

24
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,733
Be watchful, these Yeti are more dangerous than we thought.

25
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,488
- Khrisong.  - What is it? What do you want?

26
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,311
- Um, I want a word with you.   - Well?

27
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:23,711
Alone.

28
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,777
- Yes?  - Look I've been thinking.
Now that we've found out that...

29
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,780
... that these abominable snowmen are mechanical things...

30
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,644
- Well?  - Don't you see it means that I am right!

31
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,640
The real Yeti are there,
hiding up there somewhere in those mountains.

32
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,200
- This is no concern of mine.
- No, but Khrisong, wait.

33
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:44,888
I um... I want to go out there, after them.

34
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,755
That would be foolishness!

35
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,170
Look, I've always said that the real Yeti are harmless.

36
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,400
Now I must make a... find out for sure.

37
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,688
Otherwise the whole point of my expedition would be lost.

38
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,010
And those devil creatures would kill you.

39
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,580
Yes well, that's a chance I'll have to take.

40
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,066
- No! I will not allow it.
- But don't you see?

41
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,420
The real Yeti may be killed by these robots.
Look, I must go!

42
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,377
No, I forbid it!

43
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:12,066
Look I'm not one of your monks, you know?
You can't give me orders.

44
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,355
No. I've said that no one will leave.

45
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,500
Anyone may be controlling these monsters. Even you.

46
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:21,430
- Oh that's ridiculous...
- I have given my orders! Obey them!

47
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:35,280
Sir, I have no choice, I must obey Khrisong.

48
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:37,300
Do you not realise the man's a wee bit daffy?

49
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,466
Oh I wouldn't say that, Jamie.
He's just doing his duty, as he sees it.

50
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:43,980
But I think he is mistaken not to trust you.
There is much sense in what you say.

51
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,955
- Oh thank you, Thomni.  - Doctor

52
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:47,844
- Come here a moment.  - What is it?

53
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:51,540
The place you said where the control unit would go, it's round.

54
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:53,511
- Yes?   - Well I wonder if...

55
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,755
Jamie, you remember in that cave, we found that sphere.
Well don't you think it could go...

56
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:00,066
- Hey yes! I believe you're right...
- Yes, but I've thought of that.

57
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,600
But the thing was as light as a feather,
there couldn't have been anything inside it.

58
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,088
Unless...

59
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:08,711
- Where is it?
- Well I gave it to you. You were looking at it.

60
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,022
I remember, I put it down somewhere.

61
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:12,066
- The Buddha! The Buddha in the courtyard!
- I put it down by the Buddha!

62
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,370
Oh now please, Thomni, please!

63
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:25,330
- It's not here, Doctor.
- But I swear I put it down here by the Buddha.

64
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,950
- Aye, well its not here now.
- Somebody must have picked it up.

65
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,150
Oh dear.

66
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:31,660
Maybe that guard's taken it.

67
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:33,420
Aye, let's ask him.

68
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,422
No. Tact, Jamie. I'll handle this.

69
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:49,580
Hello guard, good evening.
Um, I wonder if you could help us.

70
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:53,960
I um... I left a... a silver sphere by the Buddha there.

71
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,488
Sphere? It's a shiny round thing.

72
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,460
It's most important. Have you taken it?

73
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,450
No, and if anyone had I should have seen them.

74
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,910
Ralpachan, who has passed through the courtyard?

75
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,755
Master Khrisong, but he touched nothing.

76
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,400
- No one else?  - The Englishman, Travers.

77
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,866
Travers? Are you sure he didn't pick it up?

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,020
I am sure. He spoke only to Khrisong and now he is gone.

79
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,060
Gone?

80
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,430
He said Khrisong had given him permission to leave.

81
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,050
But that's impossi...

82
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,230
- He has tricked you!
- Aye, he must have taken it!

83
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,380
- Yes, but why?
- Could he be the one that's doing it?

84
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,720
I wonder. Are you sure he didn't take the sphere with him?

85
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,360
- He took nothing!
- I'll find his room and search it.

86
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,190
- Right, Jamie.
- We must tell Khrisong what has happened.

87
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,377
Yes, yes. Travers, I can't believe
he has anything to do with these robots.

88
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:39,066
One thing's for certain, it couldn't have moved on its own.

89
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,890
How if the devil should breath life into it again?

90
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,660
My ghost trap will ward off the evil spirits.

91
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,382
Mmm, but to fetter it with chains is also wise.

92
00:05:55,244 --> 00:05:58,650
The strangers say that this creature is not flesh and blood.

93
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,977
How can this be, does it not move?

94
00:06:01,244 --> 00:06:05,420
- Strangers, do not believe them, Sapan.  - But see.

95
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,155
It is but armour, such as any warrior would wear.

96
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,110
The devil in his guile wears his armour
beneath the skin to protect his evil heart.

97
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,533
Such a being is against nature, it troubles me. Let us go.

98
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:25,230
What have you been doing, my brothers?

99
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,010
We have built a spirit trap about the monster, my Abbot.

100
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,511
This is well thought, Sapan, you are wise.

101
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,770
You should never have allowed this monster
to have been brought into the Monastery, Khrisong.

102
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,510
What I allow is my affair, Rinchen.

103
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,740
Gently, my son, gently.

104
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm sorry, my Abbot. I try to guard my tongue,

105
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:49,400
but Rinchen finds much fault in me of late.

106
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:57,066
Harsh words are like blunted arrows.
It is the truth that makes them sharp.

107
00:06:57,244 --> 00:06:58,888
I have tried to do my duty.

108
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,570
Under your guidance, the protection of the monastery lies in my hands.

109
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:06,460
I know, my son. You're task is a hard one.

110
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:12,711
And such is our adversary, that against such creatures that I must protect you.

111
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:17,466
The purpose of my life is nothing if I fail.

112
00:07:17,822 --> 00:07:22,222
You know, my Abbot, that I willingly would
lay down my life for you and my brothers.

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,288
But can I combat this with mildness.

114
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,666
You must let me fight their strength with my strength.

115
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,511
Our ways are the ways of peace, Khrisong my son.

116
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,777
You, must not seek to change them.

117
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:39,066
I would fight to preserve them.

118
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,230
You must let me. There is no other way.

119
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,244
There is. It is merely obscured to our simple minds.

120
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:55,570
I shall seek guidance from the Master, Padmasambhava.

121
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,711
- Khrisong! Khrisong, I must speak with you.
- What is it?

122
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,660
- Have you given Travers permission to leave the monastery?
- Of course not!

123
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,066
- Well he's gone!  - How?

124
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:08,822
The guard at the gate said you'd given him permission.

125
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:12,240
Did he? Very well. Come with me.

126
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,422
- It's about time you let me help you.  - Help?

127
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,244
I want to make sure you don't disappear as well.

128
00:08:25,377 --> 00:08:27,080
It's the Abbot, is he all right?

129
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,311
- Oh yes, he's in a trance. We must leave him now.
- Trance?

130
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:32,888
Yes, Master.

131
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,970
Who's he talking to?

132
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,000
The Master, Padmasambhava.
He's asking for spiritual guidance.

133
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,880
How?

134
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,620
I hear you, Master. I am coming.

135
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,960
Where's he going?

136
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,750
To the Holy Sanctum. To Padmasambhava.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,288
- Let's follow him.
- No, no, no, it is forbidden!

138
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,120
No one but the Abbot may enter.

139
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,800
No one!

140
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,755
...And this should not have happened.

141
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:03,650
I hold you responsible, Ralpachan.

142
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,460
Oh well, what's done is done.

143
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,810
Ah, Jamie.

144
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:09,600
- Searched his room, but it's not there.  - I see.

145
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,933
Khrisong, you must see that it is vital
that I examine one of these control units.

146
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,533
The one that Jamie bought down from the mountains has disappeared.

147
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:21,050
Someone is trying to stop us learning the truth.

148
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:23,590
You must let us outside to find the other one!

149
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:29,370
Oh, look...

150
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:42,420
Very well. I will go.

151
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:27,320
No! No, Victoria, we mustn't.

152
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,190
- I only want to see where he's going.
- I told you,

153
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,822
The Sanctum. No one is allowed to go there.
Please, let us go back.

154
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,711
You mean to say you've lived here
all this time and never been in there.

155
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:36,620
- Yes.  - You are funny.

156
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,777
- Aren't you the tinniest bit curious?   - No.

157
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,511
And you've never seen this... Master?

158
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:44,222
Never.

159
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,422
Don't you want to know what he looks like?

160
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:50,088
- Oh, sure you do. Come on.
- No! Miss Victoria,

161
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:52,070
Can't you understand that it is impossible?

162
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,066
- I don't see...  - No you do not!

163
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:57,666
It is forbidden. And I have been brought up on the path of obedience.

164
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,511
Very well.

165
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:06,520
But I'll get there somehow.

166
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,670
- Hasn't he found it yet?  - No.

167
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,222
- No. Khrisong, can I give you a hand?
- Stay where you are!

168
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:19,070
Far better if the Yeti had not been brought into the monastery.

169
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:21,711
I'm sorry, Master, I could not prevent it.

170
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:27,755
The Doctor is wise. His eyes are not closed in ignorance.

171
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:32,022
If he is not ignorant perhaps he might assist you with your plan.

172
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:39,090
But his mind is on a complex plane. It is hard to fathom.

173
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:44,555
There is a chance he will oppose what we have to do.

174
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:51,311
NO. WE MUST CONTINUE WITH THE WORK, ALONE.

175
00:11:51,688 --> 00:12:01,350
I MUST NOW MAKE SURE OUR PLAN IS IMPERILLED NO MORE.

176
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:39,070
I've found it!

177
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,911
- Khrisong! Behind you! Yeti!   - Come in!

178
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,511
- No!   - Don't be a fool!

179
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:51,844
Don't be a fool, they're on top of you!

180
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:05,688
Quick get him inside!

181
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,270
They came to get their ball back.

182
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:26,888
It would seem that the Yeti have caused some little upset at the gates.

183
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,266
However their work is accomplished.

184
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:38,244
Now, Songsten, observe.

185
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:47,222
These three Yeti are waiting for you.

186
00:13:49,133 --> 00:14:01,266
Take this pyramid I have prepared. Take it to the caves.

187
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:11,466
Then the Great Intelligence will focus upon this planet.

188
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:22,355
Soon it will begin to grow and at last take on physical form.

189
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:32,222
At last its wanderings in space will be at an end.

190
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:39,555
My work will then be done.

191
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:48,555
Go now, Songsten, do as I have asked.

192
00:14:49,444 --> 00:14:55,000
NOTHING MUST INTERFERE.

193
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,355
These creatures are indeed fearsome.

194
00:14:58,533 --> 00:14:59,733
Aye, you were lucky you weren't killed.

195
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:03,066
But why did they just turn and leave?
They had us at their mercy, why?

196
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,377
They didn't come to fight. They came for the sphere.

197
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,555
Are you sure?

198
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:08,710
Pretty sure. They didn't want me to examine it.

199
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:11,777
You talk of these creatures as if they were human, with a human's brain.

200
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:14,288
That sphere is like a brain. They had to get it back.

201
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,470
Yes, and that Yeti we caught in the net.

202
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:19,222
Well that could have been after the sphere we found in the cave.

203
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:21,390
I'd still like to know what happened to that one.

204
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,377
This sound that you heard.

205
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,111
It came from the sphere, I swear it.

206
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,355
- Some sort of signal, do you think?  - Yes, could be.

207
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:44,380
- Anyway, its a help.   - How can this help?

208
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:47,244
Well with the right sort of equipment,
these signals can be tracked.

209
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,533
You mean you can find out where the Yeti
are getting there instructions from?

210
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:51,711
- Yes, Jamie.  - Where can we find such equipment?

211
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,644
We've got to get back to the TARDIS.

212
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,244
This equipment. You have it?

213
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:58,244
Yes. But it's outside there on the mountain

214
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:00,180
Then, you must go for it.

215
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,755
You mean you'll let us go?

216
00:16:01,933 --> 00:16:04,207
I have no choice. I have failed.

217
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:07,355
My warriors are powerless. I must trust you.

218
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:10,130
Come on, let's get my coat.

219
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,844
Oh. Oh, they're not back yet. I think I'll go and find them.

220
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,422
- No need for you to come.
- I think it would be better if I came with you.

221
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,177
Afraid I may go somewhere that I shouldn't.

222
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:27,066
Oh, come on then. I don't want to stay in here with that thing.

223
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:30,640
Thomni, it were well that you went to Khrisong...

224
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,644
- Where is he?  - In the courtyard.

225
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:37,580
I will go to him. Oh, Sapan, would you care for our guest, please?

226
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:40,460
Jamie and the Doctor... are they all right?

227
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,377
Rest easily my child.

228
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,555
- They are in...  - They are very well.

229
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:48,622
There is no need for this child to worry. Is it not so, Rinchen?

230
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:50,400
You're keeping something from me.

231
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,755
My child, I have told you nothing but truth.

232
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:57,900
Your friends are busy helping our brothers.

233
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,130
- Sapan, we have duties to perform.  - True.

234
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:11,110
We must leave you. It might be wiser to join Thomni
in the courtyard. Excuse us please.

235
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:35,044
You are not well, Khrisong. You should be resting.

236
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:38,622
There can be no rest for me while this creature is here.

237
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,511
- But it is dead, what harm can it do us now?
- Even so, wiser to destroy it.

238
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,060
Rinchen or the Doctor, who is right. I do not know any longer.

239
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:54,622
Khrisong you must guard this child.

240
00:17:54,844 --> 00:17:58,733
Sapan sent her to you in the courtyard,
yet I found her near the Sanctum.

241
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,000
I didn't mean any harm.

242
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,111
For her own good, it would be safer
if she were closely guarded.

243
00:18:54,266 --> 00:19:01,400
When I have passed through the gate you will awake.
You have seen nothing.

244
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,000
I suppose everyone thinks I'm a nuisance.

245
00:19:19,822 --> 00:19:23,755
- Is that it?
- We are concerned for your safety, as you well know.

246
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,755
You're not really going to lock me up in this beastly room, are you?

247
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,176
No, I don't think that will be necessary.

248
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,533
But you must promise to behave and not cause trouble.

249
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,890
What do you mean?

250
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,066
I think perhaps you are a little too inquisitive, Miss Victoria.

251
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,430
Me? I just don't like mysteries.

252
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,311
- Your Master, for instance, Padma...
- I have told you there are some things...

253
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:47,140
- ... that you should not ask!
- Oh all right, I'm sorry. All right.

254
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,644
Look do we have to stay here? Can't I go and find the Doctor?

255
00:19:51,822 --> 00:19:53,444
The Doctor? But he's gone.

256
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,244
- Gone? Gone where?  - To the mountain.

257
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,933
I thought you knew. Did Sapan not tell you?

258
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,266
I knew he was keeping something from me.

259
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,070
- I've a good mind to go after them.
- That would be foolish!

260
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,800
Don't worry, I'm not really serious.

261
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,888
Oh please forgive me, I'm being a very bad host.

262
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,355
- Would you care for some food?  - No thank you.

263
00:20:16,244 --> 00:20:20,888
Um, yes. Perhaps on second thoughts I will.

264
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:37,240
They're not moving.

265
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,550
They can't have seen us, Doctor.

266
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,700
Perhaps they're switched off. I wonder...

267
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,688
Don't be a fool, Doctor. No point in taking chances.

268
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:48,110
Let's get to the TARDIS while we can.

269
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,240
Yes, perhaps you're right.

270
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,020
Oh no! Miss Victoria!

271
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,210
Ralpachan, the girl, did she go out?

272
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,290
What did you want, Thomni?

273
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,730
I went for food, now she has disappeared.

274
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,650
- Fool!  - I think she went after the Doctor.

275
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,170
No one has passed Ralpachan.

276
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,890
Then she must still be in the monastery.

277
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,080
Find her.

278
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,780
Where? Where could she...?

279
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,840
Miss Victoria!

280
00:21:54,910 --> 00:22:00,150
It were better that you were not found in here, my child.

281
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:01,980
Who's that?

282
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,510
The monks will look upon your presence here as sacrilege.

283
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,170
Go quickly.

284
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,670
Victoria!

285
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,910
Miss Victoria, where are you?

286
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,100
Miss Victoria!

287
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,140
My son, what is the matter?

288
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,657
Oh, Sapan, the girl, I can't find her.

289
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,590
- I think she may have...   - Aahhh!

290
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,340
Miss Victoria!

291
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,066
Oh.
