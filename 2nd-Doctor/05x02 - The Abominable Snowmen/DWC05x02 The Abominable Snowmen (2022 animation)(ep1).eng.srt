1
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,310
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,630
Aahh!

3
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,390
John?

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,000
John, where are you?

5
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,630
Aahh! Aahh!

6
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,200
I don't believe it! Marvellous!
After all this time.

7
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,760
Oh, what's so marvellous about that?

8
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,540
Well don't you see, Jamie, its the Himalayas!

9
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,870
And I do
believe we're in exactly the right... now wait a minute.

10
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,430
The Hima- what?

11
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:27,700
Shh, Shh.

12
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,040
The Himalayas, Jamie. They're mountains.

13
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,880
Aye I can see that. Hey is it the Earth, Doctor?

14
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:35,410
I don't fancy another tangle down the Cybermen's tomb.

15
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,340
No, no. Shh, Jamie, Shh! Yes of course it's the Earth.

16
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:42,790
Yes... yes I think I'm right... yes...

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,740
Where are these mountains?

18
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,520
Don't you know where the Himalayas are?

19
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,620
They're in India. Well at least I think so...

20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,920
Yes, that's it! I knew it! I knew it! It's incredible.

21
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,300
Right! No, no, not India.

22
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,220
This is Tibet. That's where we are, Tibet.

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,560
Now, there's no time to be lost.

24
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,990
Come along, Jamie, we must find the ghanta.

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,920
The what?

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,493
The ghanta, the ghanta. I put it here somewhere.

27
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,360
Come along, Jamie, help me.

28
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,310
Hey what am I supposed to be looking for?

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,380
I told you it's...

30
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,420
Good Lord, I haven't seen that for years.

31
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,930
Oh, that's the ghanta then?

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,860
No, no, no, no. It's a...

33
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,830
Well... whatever it is... it's nice to see it again.

34
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,140
Oh.

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,960
Thank you. Come along, Victoria.

36
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,180
Hey, Doctor, would you look at these.

37
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:42,000
- You never told me you had these.
- No, Jamie.

38
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,300
Hey I could fix those easily.

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,480
Yes I was afraid of that.

40
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,640
Jamie, you're getting as bad as the Doctor.

41
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,220
Come along, help me find the ghanta.

42
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,060
It would help us considerably
if we knew what we were looking for.

43
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,110
- Ghanta!
- But what is it?

44
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,680
Oh, what is it, you don't
know. Oh, it's a bell.

45
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,440
Oh, it's a bell, Jamie.

46
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,170
Oh, a bell. Oh, well now we
know what we're looking for.

47
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,860
Yes, it's a Tibetan bell, actually. A holy relic.

48
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,380
This one is quite small,
it has a dragon on it.

49
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,760
And it has rather an interesting history, it was... Oh!

50
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,440
Ah ha, yes I'll have that.

51
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,220
Ah ha, yes, it's just the thing for this climate.

52
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,990
You might as well find yourselves something while you're about it.

53
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,720
- How do I look?
- Doctor, you look beautiful.

54
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,380
Yes, I thought I might.

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,061
I think I'll go and have a scout around.

56
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,390
Now you two find the bell, it's very important.

57
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,960
Oh, but why do you want it?

58
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,920
Because down there it's going to
guarantee us the welcome of a lifetime!

59
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,940
- Down there?
- Oh, don't ask me.

60
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,066
When you've been with the Doctor as long as I have,

61
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,420
you begin to realise you don't know what he's talking about.

62
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,380
We better find this bell of his.

63
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,030
Wait a minute, Jamie.

64
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,780
Hey come and give us a hand.

65
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,860
I want to see where the Doctor's gone.

66
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,610
Now if I turn this to the left... it should... a ha that's it.

67
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,080
Hey, now would you look at this.

68
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,680
Oh, that's marvellous. What...

69
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,840
- Hey, what's that?
- Where?

70
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:09,120
A great sort of hairy beastie. Turn the thing back.

71
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,780
No, to the right.

72
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,770
- I am!
- Downwards. That's it, there!

73
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,180
Oh no, my mistake.

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,540
The great
hairy beastie, it's the Doctor.

75
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,090
Yes, ah, yes.

76
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,210
A monastery!

77
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,440
Aye, that will be where he's gone.

78
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,070
I wonder why he wouldn't take us?

79
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,500
You can never tell with the Doctor.

80
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,860
Hey, just thought. Do they let lasses into monasteries?

81
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,560
I don't know. Oh, don't say that.

82
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,770
Oh never mind, I suppose he'll manage somehow.

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,960
Hey, shall we open it?

84
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,160
I don't think so, the Doctor may not like it.

85
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,580
Apart from climbing boots I really think
you ought to wear something warm.

86
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,220
I tell you I'm a Highlander, the cold doesn't affect me.

87
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:37,460
There's a great deal of difference
between the Highlands and the Himalayas, Jamie.

88
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:38,490
Aye, they're bigger.

89
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,250
Oh, there you are Doctor. I found
this bell thing you were looking for.

90
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,540
Oh, splendid, splendid.

91
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,530
Is the monastery far? Can we come too?

92
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,300
Mmm, yes. Oh, no.

93
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,360
One thing at a time,
Victoria. We must find this ghanta.

94
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,170
- Oh, here.
- Oh, um.

95
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,250
Is this where we're going, Detsen?

96
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,660
Um. Detsen, yes that's the name of the monastery, but

97
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,320
I'm afraid you're not going.

98
00:06:02,326 --> 00:06:04,740
- Well not yet a while anyway.
- Doctor!

99
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,830
No, I think it would be better if I went alone.

100
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,184
You've seen something haven't you?

101
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,670
Would it not be better if I went with you?

102
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,040
Is there something dangerous then, Doctor?

103
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,766
Oh, good heavens no!
No, there's nothing for you to worry about.

104
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:21,750
Now you stay here with Jamie, inside,
and I'll be as quick as I can.

105
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,410
Oh ah, Doctor.

106
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,070
Oh, ha ha. I nearly forgot it.

107
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,180
Oh, I'm getting bored. Let's go outside.

108
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,300
No I don't think we should.

109
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,560
- All right I'll go by myself.
- Oh no you won't!

110
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,600
You won't leave me here by myself.

111
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,830
Oh come on, we needn't be long.

112
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,640
Aye, well just a quick look then.

113
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,650
Anybody here?

114
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,380
What can you see?

115
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,400
Come on, it's a marvellous view.

116
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,270
Aye, so it is. Now come away back.

117
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,580
- Why?
- Because the Doctor said that...

118
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,340
Well if you must know, I am cold.

119
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,950
Didn't I tell you. Now why don't you go and get that coat?

120
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,880
Because I'm not leaving you out here on your own, and that's final.

121
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,660
- Jamie, look!
- What is it?

122
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,260
Footprints. Look at the size of them.

123
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,880
Something's been walking around the TARDIS.

124
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:47,940
What could it be, Jamie, a bear?

125
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,730
Whatever it is, it's pretty big. We better get inside.

126
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,180
I'd like to find out what it is first. Wouldn't you?

127
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,066
Look we must be careful. This could be dangerous.

128
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,290
Wait while I get that sword.

129
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,020
Hello there.

130
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,860
Hello!

131
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,600
Where is everybody?

132
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,187
Oh, ah ha, there you are.

133
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,508
I thought...

134
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,360
I thought for one... moment.

135
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,620
What do you want here?

136
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,680
- I've come to...
- Look he's got my rucksack.

137
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,940
- Oh that. - You murderous devil!

138
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,500
Who is this man?

139
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,030
I don't know, but this is mine all right.

140
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,580
- But you said...
- Be silent.

141
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,980
You said it was a beast that attacked you.

142
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,660
Yes, but it was dark.

143
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,390
I remember all I could see was a vague shape, but I felt it's hair.

144
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,440
Well it's quite obvious now that it's this coat he's wearing.

145
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:59,200
Why did you attack this man?

146
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,700
Me! I haven't attacked anyone!

147
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,680
- I found the haversack on the mountain.
- He's lying!

148
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,840
- I also found a dead man!
- Yes you killed him!

149
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
Enough! Seize him.

150
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,680
- But you can't possibly...
- Silence.

151
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,840
This man accuses you of one crime,
but there have been many others.

152
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,066
If you are responsible, be sure you will be punished.

153
00:12:24,716 --> 00:12:26,290
Take him away.

154
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,420
But this is ridiculous.

155
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,200
Why don't you listen to me?

156
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,100
Where are you taking me?

157
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,560
Watch him carefully, Khrisong, he's dangerous.

158
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,280
This is possible.

159
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,070
We do not know he is the attacker.

160
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,520
Of course he is! I've just said he's so.

161
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,240
Why then did he come here?

162
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,720
That, also, we shall discover.

163
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,160
The welcome of a life time?

164
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,000
Jamie, look!

165
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,260
Aye, that'll be where the beastie lives, right enough.

166
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,510
And it's as far as we're going.

167
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,110
Oh we can't turn back now.

168
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
We can and we will, it could be dangerous.

169
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,430
How do you know? It may be quite harmless.

170
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,230
With feet that size?

171
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,740
Well just a quick look inside.

172
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,290
Look, if that animal is dangerous
we could be walking into a trap.

173
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,950
- Oh but Jamie...
- No, we're going back, I mean it.

174
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,660
- Jamie. Look...
- Hey! Wait a minute.

175
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,440
Well what is it?

176
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,510
Look there, just inside the cave.

177
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,970
Where? I can't see anything.

178
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,430
It looks like a beam of wood.

179
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,110
Oh it can't be.

180
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,080
It might not be an animal's den after all.

181
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:56,860
I'm going to take a closer look.

182
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,060
- Oh but Jamie...
- Look, a wild animal's one thing...

183
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,740
...I'm not afraid of a man!

184
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,130
This is a man's work all right.

185
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,950
Oh let's go back, Jamie.

186
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,930
Jamie!

187
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,450
JAMIE!

188
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,080
Hey, come and a look at this.

189
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,750
Jamie, listen! There's something coming!

190
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,560
Get back.

191
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,380
Its a 100 foot drop outside that window.

192
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,240
There's no way out you know.

193
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,910
I didn't think there would be.

194
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,500
How did you track me down?

195
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,180
Track you down? I don't even know who you are.

196
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,680
Don't play the innocent with me! It won't work.

197
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,340
If it wasn't for my expedition you wouldn't be here.

198
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,400
Hmm. You're one of those wretched newspaper men.

199
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,360
Paper Men? I wish I know what you are talking about?

200
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,540
Oh yes! You laughed at me in the press didn't you.

201
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,440
"Travers - the mad anthropologist".

202
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,400
After that, even my own Society wouldn't finance me.

203
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,800
But I know they're here. Twenty years I've been searching.

204
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,580
Twenty years!

205
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,280
I've staked my reputation and every penny I own on this expedition.

206
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,840
Now, when I'm close to finding them, you want to steal my glory!

207
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,630
Just for the sake of a cheap headline.

208
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,660
Finding them? Finding what?

209
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,120
Don't pretend. They're here.
Somewhere on these mountains.

210
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,240
- What are?!
- You know!

211
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,780
The Yeti! The Abominable Snowmen!

212
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:03,066
Oh, it's not use, I can't shift it.

213
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,740
Perhaps there is another way out of here.

214
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,150
I'm gonna see what's down there.

215
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,700
Oh no! Don't! There may be more of them.

216
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:10,400
Aye, there might. That's why I want you to stay here.

217
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,160
Oh no...

218
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,824
Look, you're safe enough for the moment.

219
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,250
If you need me just yell your head off.

220
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,760
Don't worry, I will!

221
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:23,540
But it could have been the Yeti that attacked you.

222
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,460
Rubbish! The Yeti are timid creatures. They're shy...

223
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,920
- But...
- They're afraid of men.

224
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,180
But... Why me!? Why say I did it?

225
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,240
You want a clear field don't you.

226
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,760
I discovered the Yeti! 

227
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,600
The honour's mine, but you want to take it from me.

228
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,500
Why, you even murdered my companion...

229
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,980
... just to get a cheap story for your newspaper.

230
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,540
- That is ridiculous.
- Is it?

231
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,066
Whoever killed your friend had enormous strength.

232
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,750
Yes?

233
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,580
Well, could I have done it? Well, could I?

234
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,260
No. I'm not going to discuss it any further.

235
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,330
There's work to be done. The expedition must go on!

236
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,480
Khrisong will find out the truth!

237
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,110
Travers! Travers, come back!

238
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,600
We have the word of the Englishman, Travers.

239
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,890
But how do we know he is telling the truth.

240
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:31,610
Why should he lie?

241
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:37,980
In any case, I am not so concerned with
the death of Travers's companion.

242
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,240
Four of our brothers have been slaughtered.
That is my concern.

243
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,000
Had we not agreed that the Yeti were responsible?

244
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:54,005
True, Rinchen. But have we not also wondered why?

245
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,656
They were so rarely seen, timid.

246
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:04,600
Then, suddenly they become savage...

247
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,866
Did we not wonder why?

248
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,311
Did we not wonder what or whom had brought this change?

249
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:22,555
And now, here is this stranger and Travers accuses him.

250
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:25,469
He may be a cause.

251
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:32,533
I ask you again. Let me put it to the truth. Now.

252
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:36,360
You are asking us to condemn
a man to certain death.

253
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:41,822
I am Chief Warrior. Is it not my duty to protect you?

254
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:44,422
But not by taking a man's life.

255
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:48,066
Yes, if it is necessary.

256
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,644
No! Only the Abbot can decide.

257
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,890
Songtsen alone can approve such measures.

258
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:58,170
It is time for prayer, my brothers.

259
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:27,066
Wait! We must decide now!

260
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:33,120
No, Khrisong. After our meditations
we will consult the Abbot.

261
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:42,370
This is foolishness! Time will be wasted!

262
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,400
Do they wish more of our brothers to die
before I'm allowed to take action.

263
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:50,711
- There is no other way.
- There is, for me.

264
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,311
Let them meditate. Let them consult.

265
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,622
I, Khrisong, will act!

266
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:03,066
Bring me the prisoner.

267
00:21:26,844 --> 00:21:30,066
Jamie! Jamie, it's coming back!

268
00:21:30,844 --> 00:21:32,400
Get back in there!

269
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,266
- Oh, is it safe?
- Aye. Now go on!

270
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,560
Stop!

271
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:54,400
Jamie, get back! It will kill you!
