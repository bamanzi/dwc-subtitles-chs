1
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,080
Keep back, Victoria! I can't stop it.

2
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,300
Jamie, the roof!

3
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:43,133
- What are you doing?
- We have to stop it somehow!

4
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,244
- You'll bury us alive!
- It's our only chance. Get back!

5
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,630
Are you all right?

6
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,260
That horrible thing! What was it?

7
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,471
I don't know. Did you see what it did to my sword?

8
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,066
Broke it like a piece of wood!
No human's as strong as that.

9
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,311
What is this place?

10
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,140
And what are those?

11
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:22,110
Some sort of metal.

12
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,260
They're all glowing.

13
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,060
- Oh, let's get away from here, Jamie!
- Aye, if we can.

14
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,820
I don't think the tunnel's completely blocked. Come on.

15
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,620
Don't worry about that. It's quite dead.

16
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:48,844
- What's the matter?
- Look!

17
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,820
Come on!

18
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,030
- Come.
- About time, too!

19
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,860
- Come to release me, have you?
- No, sir.

20
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,860
Oh, well. First things first... what's your name?

21
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,180
- Thonmi. You must come with me.
- I see, Thonmi.

22
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,977
- After we've had a little chat.
- Khrisong will be waiting!

23
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,888
No, no. Just wait.
Nobody seems to want to listen to me,

24
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:42,533
and everyone is jumping to the wrong conclusions.

25
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:47,150
You seem to be a reasonable sort of chap.
What's going on here?

26
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,460
We are besieged. The Yeti have turned upon us.

27
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:56,380
- At least, that is what we thought until...
- Until I turned up. I see...

28
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,750
Every time I visit Detsen,
the monastery is in some sort of trouble.

29
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,066
You were here before?

30
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,240
That attack in 1630, what was the outcome?

31
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:07,111
You know something of our history.

32
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:10,288
- A little.
- That was also a dark period.

33
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:13,777
It was then our holy Ghanta was taken from us.

34
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,688
Oh, dear. Never mind.
I'm sure it'll turn up again.

35
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:22,244
- Legend tells us so, but...
- This chap Travers...

36
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,090
This chap Travers, what of him?

37
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,377
There is no time to talk.
Khrisong will be angry.

38
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:31,980
Yes, he may be angry,
but he's not the Abbot, is he?

39
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,830
- No.
- I don't think the Abbot will be angry...

40
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,666
... when he sees what I've brought with me.

41
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:40,580
What do you mean? Show me.

42
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,780
I want you to help me to get this to the Abbot.

43
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,900
Why this delay?

44
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,790
Seize him. Take him to the gate.

45
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,510
Abbot! The straw!

46
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,180
Follow me.

47
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,488
Victoria, the Tardis is that way!

48
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:41,377
I know, but we must warn the Doctor!

49
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:43,940
We don't even know where he is. Run!

50
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,420
Khrisong.

51
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,900
- Khrisong.
- Do not interfere, Rinchen.

52
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,180
Did we not decide to consult the Abbot Songsten?

53
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,670
We?

54
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,020
You mean YOU had decided.

55
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,400
- The time for talk is past.
- But Khrisong, the Abbot must...

56
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:27,311
Must I always consult the Abbot
before I take any decisive action?

57
00:05:27,444 --> 00:05:29,980
Travers, don't you think
this has gone far enough?

58
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,380
- There's nothing I can do.
- What do you hope to gain?

59
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,580
- Time.
- Time?

60
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,688
You've killed my companion, left me single handed

61
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:42,066
but don't worry, you won't get another chance to get in my way.

62
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:45,355
I shall find the Yeti, with or without help.

63
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,540
- You can't possibly leave...
- Can't I?

64
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,620
You'll be quite  safe here,
and I know where you are. I'm going.

65
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:56,340
Don't worry. The monks won't harm you.

66
00:05:56,844 --> 00:05:59,780
- They're men of peace.
- Men of peace?

67
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,540
You are asking us...

68
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,940
You are asking us to agree to murder.

69
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:14,533
No. Our hands will be clean.

70
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,844
After deliberately using him as bait?
You cannot be so ruthless.

71
00:06:19,022 --> 00:06:23,066
Sapan, I believe that this man is, for some reason...

72
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,222
...trying to turn the Yeti into savage creatures.

73
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:29,688
- But what proof is there?
- You've heard the word of Travers.

74
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:33,066
He is an Englishman. A stranger.

75
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,133
He's a killer.

76
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,266
Let me tie him to the gate.

77
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,540
If the Yeti come to rescue him,
we will know the truth...

78
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,911
.. and my warriors will be waiting.

79
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:50,533
- But if he is innocent?
- My warriors will protect him.

80
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,111
Khrisong, there may be wisdom in what you say.

81
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:56,200
- All we ask is that you wait until...
- No!

82
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,977
I have done with waiting.

83
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,060
Bring him to the gate!

84
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:39,688
Master Abbot.

85
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:44,844
Abbot Songsten.

86
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,022
- Forgive me, Abbot.
- Thonmi!

87
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:54,340
- I am sorry, but...
- You know well that only I may enter here.

88
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,140
What is this?

89
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,260
Where did you get this?

90
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,540
Is it not the Ghanta that was lost?

91
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,420
<i>It is, my son.</i>

92
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:18,710
<i>200 years or more, it has been lost to us.</i>

93
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,630
<i>How came you by it?</i>

94
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,220
It is the master. Padmasambhava.

95
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,020
Do not be afraid.

96
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,420
Answer him.

97
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,380
A stranger brought it, master.

98
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,020
<i>The DoctorI</i>

99
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:50,140
<i>So, he has returned</i>

100
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:58,100
<i>Bring the Ghanta to me, my son.</i>

101
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:10,060
<i>Both of you.</i>

102
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:24,500
<i>Do not be afraid, Thonmi.</i>

103
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,790
Ralpachan, watch from the window there.
You, the other window.

104
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,800
Any attempt to rescue you
will now be highly dangerous for you.

105
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:50,300
Look, nobody IS going to rescue me,
least of all an Abominable Snowman!

106
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,555
Hasn't it occurred to you, that innocent or guilty

107
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,466
that whatever's been killing your monks might very well kill me?

108
00:09:56,622 --> 00:10:02,355
If you are innocent, then let us hope
that we will have the time to rescue you.

109
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,355
- I think we've shaken it off.
- Have we? Oh, good.

110
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:38,777
Come on. It can't be much further.

111
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:41,700
- Listen!
- What is it?

112
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,180
Something's coming. Come on!

113
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:51,066
Hey,  who the devil are you? What are you doing here?

114
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,822
We're on the way to the monastery.

115
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:54,533
Are you indeed?

116
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:58,340
You're a strange pair to find roaming around these mountains.

117
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,380
- You aren't anything to do with that newspaper fellow, I suppose?
- What do you mean?

118
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:07,044
He says he's a doctor. but I know what he's really after.

119
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,800
- Have you seen him?
- Yes, I've seen him.

120
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:12,066
Is he all right?

121
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,620
Yes, he's quite all right.

122
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,820
So, you're going to the monastery, are you? Good.

123
00:11:22,022 --> 00:11:25,422
I think you'll find those lamas have quite a welcome waiting for you.

124
00:11:25,577 --> 00:11:27,066
The Doctor said there would be.

125
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:31,088
- Did he, now?
- I wouldn't go that way if I were you.

126
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:33,822
- Wouldn't you?
- There's something up there.

127
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:35,777
A great hairy beastie.

128
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:38,720
- Where?
- In a cave.

129
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:42,320
- A cave? Have you found their cave?
- Aye.

130
00:11:43,044 --> 00:11:45,333
- Will you show me where it is?
- Oh, no

131
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,244
No, we couldn't go back there, not with Victoria.

132
00:11:47,422 --> 00:11:49,422
Now look here, young fellow, stop playing games with me.

133
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:52,266
I know that
you and that Doctor fellow are after the Yeti.

134
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,530
Yeti? What's he talking about?

135
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:59,311
You mean you're not part of some press expedition?

136
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,724
- Expedition?
- We're not part of anything.

137
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,866
- We're just visiting the monastery.
- But the cave...

138
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,244
If you want to tangle with that beastie,
I'll show you the cave.

139
00:12:09,377 --> 00:12:13,460
- You will?
- After you've shown us how to get to the monastery.

140
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,940
I've nothing to lose, I suppose.

141
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,700
All right. Come with me.

142
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,180
<i>Tell me, my son.</i>

143
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,540
<i>Is the Doctor alone?</i>

144
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,510
Yes, master.

145
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:42,030
<i>We are grateful
for the return of the holy Ghanta.</i>

146
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,780
<i>The Doctor is our friend.</i>

147
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:51,340
<i>He must be treated with respect and kindness.</i>

148
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,070
<i>Thonmi...</i>

149
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,660
<i>You will go to Khrisong.</i>

150
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:03,900
<i>Tell him the Abbot orders the release of the Doctor.</i>

151
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,590
<i>Go now.</i>

152
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:21,420
<i>Remember, these words were spoken by the Abbot here.</i>

153
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:28,340
<i>You will forget that you have entered this room,</i>

154
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:33,066
<i>or that you have spoken to me.</i>

155
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,980
<i>Therefore, Songsten,</i>

156
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:16,844
<i>we must make certain that Doctor
learns nothing of what is happening.</i>

157
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:22,844
<i>He is a man of great knowledge
and intelligence,</i>

158
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:29,110
<i>but he may not show sympathy
for the powers that guide us.</i>

159
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:37,060
<i>He may even seek to hinder the Great Plan.</i>

160
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,780
<i>It might be wise</i>

161
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:47,660
<i>if he departs as soon as possible.</i>

162
00:14:57,377 --> 00:15:00,266
Khidom, In the rocks! Did you see something?

163
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:05,288
Something is coming, Khrisong! The Yeti!

164
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,022
Oh, no!

165
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,288
Be ready to kill them!

166
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:15,711
Jamie! Victoria! Keep back!

167
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:18,490
Keep back! They'll kill you!

168
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:24,622
Keep away! Get away!

169
00:15:25,977 --> 00:15:28,733
You see? I was right.

170
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:32,760
Khrisong! It was all a mistake.
Doctor!

171
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,355
I've talked to these youngsters.

172
00:15:35,555 --> 00:15:37,688
I'm sorry. This is not the man that attacked me.

173
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:40,290
- Seize them.
- What's going on?

174
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,970
I told you to keep away. He's led you into a trap!

175
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:44,533
- No, Doctor...
- Silence!

176
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:46,488
Who are these people?

177
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:49,755
- They're friends of his.
- Then they shall act as hostages also.

178
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,240
- Where have you been?
- With the Abbot. We must release him.

179
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,560
This stranger has brought back to us
the holy Ghanta that was lost.

180
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:06,120
We must treat him with respect and kindness.
These are the words of our Abbot.

181
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:14,288
- Is this true?
- Of course.

182
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:16,620
Then why did you not tell me?

183
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,100
You'd already accused me of murder.

184
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:23,222
You were hardly in the right frame of mind to listen...

185
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:26,577
...to my story of how I came by the bell, now where you?

186
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:29,355
Oh, please.

187
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,180
This wasn't the welcome I expected, you know!

188
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,460
As for you, Travers...

189
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,440
<i>It is well to remember</i>

190
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:53,600
<i>that nothing must disturb our preparations.</i>

191
00:16:54,126 --> 00:17:00,244
<i>There is little time left now.</i>

192
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,800
How, if the Doctor will not go...

193
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,360
<i>His life could be in great danger.</i>

194
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,777
<i>He has been a good friend in the past.</i>

195
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:22,733
<i>It would be ill if the life
of such a one became imperilled.</i>

196
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,340
- You found this in the cave?
- Aye.

197
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,422
- There were lots of them.
- What do you think it is?

198
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,066
I've no idea. This creature, what was it like?

199
00:17:33,288 --> 00:17:37,488
It was huge, and all covered with hair.
Like a sort of bear.

200
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:41,111
- It attacked us.
- It sounds like your Abominable Snowman.

201
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,160
- They wouldn't attack anyone.
- No, I always thought so.

202
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,220
They're shy, elusive creatures.

203
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,933
Why do you think it's taken me
so long to track them down?

204
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,711
What made this? I wonder what it's for.

205
00:17:53,466 --> 00:17:57,340
Oh, well... I'd like to see one of these creatures.

206
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,311
It was horrible.

207
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:02,222
It was buried under tons of rock,
yet it still got up and came after us.

208
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,470
- Like a nightmare.
- Fear makes us imagine all sorts of things.

209
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,530
Including creatures that don't seem to be flesh and blood.

210
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,955
- Khrisong! Khrisong
- What? What's the matter?

211
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:14,822
- Come quickly!
- What is it?

212
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:17,180
- He must have seen something.
- Look!

213
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:23,200
There they are at last! Yeti! After all these years!

214
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,355
Ralpachan,stand watch at the wall.

215
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,288
Pletu, I want two men either side of here.
Thonmi, come with me.

216
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:31,266
Look, they're magnificent!
Just as I thought they'd be.

217
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,510
Do you really think they'll attack?

218
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,840
I don't know. They have never been this close before.

219
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:36,580
They won't attack anyone.
They're timid. You'll see.

220
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,711
Yes, but if they do, do you think could you capture one?

221
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,400
I would like to examine one.

222
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,510
- Examine it? Aye, we'll wrap it up for you
- Thank you, Jamie.

223
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,260
Thonmi, come. We must see to the defences.
Boy, open the gates.

224
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,888
If you want to capture one of these beasties,
I have an idea that might just work.

225
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:58,540
Victoria, this is one of those instances
where discretion is the better part of valour.

226
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,800
Jamie has an idea. Come along.

227
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,377
Have no fear.

228
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:11,910
Now that the holy Ghanta
has been returned to us, all will be well.

229
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,060
What if the Yeti do attack?

230
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,220
Have faith, Rinchen.

231
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,420
Khrisong and his warriors will protect us.

232
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,150
Khrisong is a rash man.

233
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:26,860
He was so sure that this Doctor
was a threat to us.

234
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,700
I can assure you I am not.

235
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,420
I hope this is going to work.
Are you ready up there? Catch!

236
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,380
- There is one coming!
- Aye, one's enough.

237
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,900
The others don't seem to be moving.

238
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,550
Keep it back. I'm not ready for it yet.

239
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,660
That's it. Stand by. Here it comes.

240
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,500
Now!

241
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,380
Right, haul on the rope, quick. Quick with the net!

242
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,980
Pull hard that way!

243
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,380
Wait.

244
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,860
- It's dead.
- Aye.

245
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,340
Why aren't the others attacking?

246
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,422
They're going!

247
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,700
Good! Let's get this one inside.

248
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,540
You were right about one thing, Victoria.

249
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,540
This creature certainly doesn't seem to be flesh and blood.

250
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,020
It's not your Abominable Snowman either, Travers.

251
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:47,666
- It's metal.
- That's incredible!

252
00:21:47,844 --> 00:21:49,980
- What is it?
- A devil's warrior.

253
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,030
No, I don't think so. It's more like a robot.

254
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,400
A robot? Don't let your imagination
run away with you!

255
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,140
Why has it stopped?

256
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,620
Wait a minute... Wait a minute!

257
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,020
- Nothing there.
- No.

258
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,100
But there has been!
