1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,688
It was Songsten who took this pyramid into the cave?

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,355
That's right.

4
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,200
- And the Yeti never harmed him?   - No.

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,577
Songsten. He's the link I've been looking for.

6
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,940
But Khrisong is with Songsten now.

7
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:47,480
Then he is in danger!

8
00:00:49,022 --> 00:00:51,911
Songsten, danger! You are in great danger! 
Come away from this place!

9
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:53,355
What madness is this?

10
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:59,888
KHRISONG, WHENCE CAME YOU BY SUCH FOOLISH THOUGHTS?

11
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:02,686
Don't try and frighten me! Who are you?

12
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:04,444
I demand to know what is happening!

13
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,933
Demand? You are in the presence of the Master.

14
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,644
Yes, a master who controls the Yeti. What is hidden in there?

15
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:12,280
Forgive him Master.

16
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:22,244
Of course, but our brother must not be allowed to depart
 in the knowledge that I am other than what I am.

17
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:24,511
Songsten! 

18
00:01:25,488 --> 00:01:27,288
Why do you put him in a trance?

19
00:01:27,644 --> 00:01:31,777
You understand, Songsten?

20
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:33,866
I understand, Master.

21
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:39,622
You may enter, Khrisong.

22
00:01:41,177 --> 00:01:48,066
One moment! You may not take weapons into the presence of the Master.

23
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:52,733
ARE YOU AFRAID?

24
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:02,970
Waahh!

25
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,755
You have done well, Songsten.

26
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:27,711
You will now...

27
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:41,466
Why are you making me do this? Why?

28
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:51,622
Release me... I beg of you... I am...

29
00:02:51,820 --> 00:03:00,977
SONGSTEN, YOU WILL NOW GO FORTH WITH THE MONKS.

30
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:05,600
YOU WILL NEVER RETURN.

31
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:07,911
Yes, Master.

32
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:09,955
Khrisong, where are you?

33
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,066
- Khrisong!   - What has happened?

34
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:13,844
We're too late.

35
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:15,644
What have you done to Khrisong?

36
00:03:16,022 --> 00:03:19,022
What have we done? Well that's a bit cool, I must say.

37
00:03:19,288 --> 00:03:21,066
You have killed him!

38
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,422
- I...?   - SONGSTEN, KILL THEM!

39
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,000
Jamie, grab hold of him! His hands!

40
00:03:29,288 --> 00:03:31,580
Quick, get him out of here!

41
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,066
Doctor!

42
00:03:33,288 --> 00:03:36,377
It's all right, lie still, I'll get help.

43
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,911
Too late, my time has come. Closer.

44
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:47,555
My brothers... they are not... to blame Songsten...

45
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,288
- He was... in a trance.  
- I understand

46
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,060
- Now just try...  
- Go!

47
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:57,066
Leave.. leave me..

48
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:36,377
My brothers! My brothers, Khrisong is dead.

49
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,866
- Dead?
- By whose hand?

50
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:41,000
By the hand of our Abbot, Songsten.

51
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,377
- This cannot be. 
- Aye, it's true enough.

52
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:47,555
No. What reason would he have to do such a vile thing?

53
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,777
Obviously he thought Khrisong knew too much.

54
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:54,600
Songsten, is this true?

55
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:56,888
Aaah!

56
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,155
- Keep back! 
- Do not interfere, stranger!

57
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,577
- No, leave him alone, there's been enough killing... 
- Oh, Jamie, no!

58
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:05,022
Wait! Wait, my brothers, this is no time for rashness.

59
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,644
He is quite right!

60
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:10,980
He is quite right! You listen to him.

61
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,866
- Well? 
- Kill them... kill them... 

62
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:16,800
Look, is this our Abbot who loves peace.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,933
Surely you can see he was made to kill Khrisong.

64
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,866
He is a helpless puppet!

65
00:05:21,977 --> 00:05:24,066
But I saw him on the mountain, he was leading the Yeti!

66
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,822
Yes, but by command, unknowingly.

67
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:28,530
Thomni is right, Songsten is merely a puppet.

68
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,000
Who has done this to him?

69
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:31,810
- Is it you?
- No!

70
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:37,266
I tell you I saw Songsten change. He was put in a trance, by the Master.

71
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:39,066
Have a care what you say.

72
00:05:39,177 --> 00:05:43,866
Now listen to me, all of you. Your Abbot is not responsible!

73
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,511
But neither is Padmasambhava, he too is controlled.

74
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,644
Now do as you'd planned. Leave the monastery, there is great evil here.

75
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,870
No Doctor, you're wrong. The evil is on the mountains.

76
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,333
It's that hideous thing in the caves.

77
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,066
Wherever it may be, what can we do to overcome such a force?

78
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:05,688
My brothers, let us obey the Doctor.

79
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,066
- What of you, Doctor? 
- I will stay here, Thomni.

80
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:13,733
Oh, me too.

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,711
- Why?
- I have to. 

82
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,555
This things that's here, this evil, it will spread.

83
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:22,088
It has to be stopped and I think I can do it.

84
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:26,266
Thomni, will you help me? It will be dangerous.

85
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:28,990
- You can rid us of this evil? 
- Yes, I think I can.

86
00:06:29,244 --> 00:06:32,111
And if we succeed the monks will be able to return.

87
00:06:32,444 --> 00:06:33,955
Then of course I will help.

88
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:37,066
Doctor, you're not going to send me away with the monks, are you?

89
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,311
- Yes, Victoria, I think it best. 
- Well, I won't go.

90
00:06:40,644 --> 00:06:42,466
No, I didn't think you would.

91
00:06:42,844 --> 00:06:46,111
Hey Doctor! Songsten, he's unconscious.

92
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,355
- Sapan, tend our Abbot.
- No! Wait. 

93
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:52,155
There are things I have to find out and only Songsten can tell me.

94
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,066
What makes you so sure he's going to do that?

95
00:06:54,177 --> 00:06:57,066
Sit him down here, Jamie. Over there.

96
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:05,155
The Doctor's got it wrong. I've seen that thing in the cave.

97
00:07:05,577 --> 00:07:07,688
That's what we've got to destroy.

98
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:09,777
The Doctor thinks the evil is in here...

99
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,990
I know, I've seen it, he hasn't.

100
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,733
He said himself that Padmasambhava was being controlled.

101
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:18,244
And it's that thing that's doing it. I'm going to get at it.

102
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,111
Are you coming with me?

103
00:07:20,444 --> 00:07:22,800
- Very well!
- Good man, come on.

104
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:24,822
What do you plan to do?

105
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,533
I don't quite know yet. Get to that cave...

106
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:31,044
The pyramid's the answer...

107
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:35,560
I just have to take a shot at it with this. Come on.

108
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:46,511
And the Yeti?

109
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,266
They were designed to serve the Intelligence.

110
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:54,888
I see. Now this intelligence, ah, it is confined to the cave?

111
00:07:54,955 --> 00:07:56,244
- No.  
- No?

112
00:07:56,555 --> 00:08:00,822
It has broken its promise. Now it demands the whole mountain.

113
00:08:01,177 --> 00:08:04,844
I see. Now, Songsten, I want you to help me.

114
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:06,666
I want to help you.

115
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:09,066
Now these Yeti, they are controlled?

116
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:11,133
Yes, by Padmasambhava.

117
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:14,711
Yes, but the control units, they were made somehow, somewhere?

118
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,066
The Master laboured for nearly two hundred years.

119
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:24,400
With the help of the Intelligence he built the creatures and the other wonderful machines.

120
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:31,200
These small Yeti models, their movements must be mirrored by the real robots?

121
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:33,466
- True.
- But there must be a controller.

122
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:37,644
A machine that gives out the orders. Now, where is that control?

123
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:39,066
The sanctum.

124
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,600
But I have seen the sanctum?

125
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:47,533
Throne. Behind the throne there lies a hidden room.

126
00:08:47,886 --> 00:08:50,088
How do I get into it?

127
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,577
Songsten, how do I get into it?

128
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,200
A close one. Heading towards the monastery.

129
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,600
Should we not return?

130
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,477
No, now we've come this far. Let's push on. Come on.

131
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:44,733
Take care of him, Sapan.

132
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:48,488
I will. He has suffered much.

133
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,622
Is it time to leave?

134
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:02,888
Now as soon as the monks have left, we must get into that control room.

135
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:05,310
How do we get past Padma-thingme?

136
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,066
I'll deal with him. But remember, as soon as we're in the sanctum...

137
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:13,250
...whatever happens, Thomni and you must smash the controls!

138
00:10:13,465 --> 00:10:15,295
What do you mean, whatever happens'?

139
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,444
Padmasambhava will use super-normal powers if necessary.

140
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:22,050
For a start he will try to hypnotise you again.

141
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,920
Well how can I stop him?

142
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,555
Thomni, you better teach her the 'Jewel of the Lotus Prayer'.

143
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,200
It'll give her something to concentrate on.

144
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,022
Yes, Doctor.

145
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,244
Jamie, where is Travers?

146
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,066
- Travers? 
- Well he's not here.

147
00:10:34,244 --> 00:10:35,688
Perhaps he's deserted us.

148
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:40,240
No, I don't somehow think he's done that, but I'd like to know what he's up to.

149
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:44,644
Well we're going the right way, there's some sort of path along here.

150
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,044
Look! What is it?

151
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:52,377
It's that hideous light from the cave. It's spreading all over the mountain.

152
00:10:52,846 --> 00:10:54,850
It's blinding me. How can we reach the pyramid?

153
00:10:56,733 --> 00:11:01,066
We can't. It's too late for that now I'm afraid.

154
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:03,550
But it will engulf the monastery.

155
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:19,840
Doctor, why will you not accept the aid of our warrior brothers?

156
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:23,328
Because they are needed to guard you and the lamas, Sapan.

157
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:26,243
Besides brave hearts will not suffice for this battle.

158
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:31,380
Protect them Thomni. We shall pray for you.

159
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,622
Thank you. Don't worry, everything will be all right.

160
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:40,777
When it's all over you can come back. I hope.

161
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:04,088
Now don't forget, I will go into the sanctum first 
and deal with Padmasambhava.

162
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,177
And, as soon as it's safe, make for the curtain behind the throne.

163
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,140
That's where the control room is!

164
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,490
When we have destroyed the machine what will happen?

165
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:12,420
I haven't the faintest idea.

166
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:13,507
What?

167
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,440
Don't worry, Jamie, it's going to be all right.

168
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:17,430
Hey, we might all be blown to smithereens!

169
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:18,890
What am I supposed to do?

170
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,822
Well nothing I hope, but one of us just might need help.

171
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:24,533
Are we ready? Come on.

172
00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:55,270
What shall we do?

173
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:59,044
Looks as though we're well and truly cooked.

174
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:02,800
Look! There, below us, torches. The monks must have left.

175
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:04,660
Yes, but has the Doctor?

176
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:06,478
How can we tell, we are trapped.

177
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:08,090
I don't know.

178
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:09,675
We cannot enter the monastery.

179
00:13:10,126 --> 00:13:13,270
Looks as though... we'll just have to sit tight.

180
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,800
Can we not try and join my brothers?

181
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:18,311
No! The Doctor may still be in there. I'm sure he is.

182
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:36,586
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

183
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:41,444
WHY DID YOU NOT HEED MY WARNING?

184
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:45,977
YOU ARE STUBBORN, DOCTOR.

185
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:47,280
Who are you?

186
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:56,494
YOU KNOW WELL IT IS I THE MASTER, PADMASAMBHAVA, WHO SPEAKS.

187
00:13:56,644 --> 00:14:00,784
Oh no it isn't. I know Padmasambhava, he's my friend.

188
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,460
Where have you come from? Why are you using his body in this fashion?

189
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:14,888
SUCH AS A BRAIN AS YOURS IS TOO SMALL TO GRASP MY PURPOSE.

190
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:16,480
Too small?

191
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,288
I AM MUCH POWER. 

192
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,600
Much power? Just a...

193
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Simple levitation, a childish trick.

194
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,133
Now stop playing games and open these doors.

195
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,066
Or are you afraid to meet me face to face?

196
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:43,275
YOU ARE RASH.

197
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:52,240
Now anything can happen now, just trust me and above all don't panic.

198
00:15:06,977 --> 00:15:09,066
Aah Oh!

199
00:15:09,244 --> 00:15:13,355
No! No! The Doctor said to wait!

200
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,711
Now!

201
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,090
Come on, Thomni!

202
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:08,830
Quickly! Into the control room, smash the controls!

203
00:16:11,422 --> 00:16:12,630
To work, Thomni!

204
00:16:31,153 --> 00:16:33,580
Doctor, he's bringing the Yeti in!

205
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,555
Victoria, Victoria, I can't hold him!

206
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,177
The models... knock over the models!

207
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,733
No, Victoria, don't let him!

208
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:55,933
Jewel of the Lotus'! Om mane padme hum... Om mane padme hum...

209
00:16:56,133 --> 00:17:02,810
Om mane padme hum... Om mane padme hum...

210
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:07,933
At last! Come on.

211
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,066
Om mane padme hum.

212
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,444
Oh it's no good, I can't move.

213
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:22,900
You've got to!

214
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,133
I... I can't!

215
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:29,377
Jamie! Jamie!

216
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:35,090
Jamie! Yeti's coming!

217
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:36,844
Yeti?

218
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:38,910
But we have destroyed the machines.

219
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:41,190
Well there must be something else that controls them.

220
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:44,900
The control unit, of course the sphere!

221
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:09,410
ONE STROKE OF FORTUNE WILL NOT SAVE YOU.

222
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:28,511
STUPID MAN, DID YOU NOT FEEL ENOUGH OF MY POWER WHEN YOU MET ME IN THE CAVE?

223
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,044
- The cave?
- The cave! 

224
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:37,240
Jamie, there was a pyramid in the cave!

225
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,577
- There's one here too. 
- Destroy it!

226
00:18:40,777 --> 00:18:45,130
Noooo!

227
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:28,610
Look at him.

228
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:44,500
At last peace... Thank you, Doctor...

229
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,850
Goodbye old friend.

230
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,150
You all right, Doctor?

231
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,644
Yes, Jamie, it worked.

232
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,070
The Intelligence is destroyed.

233
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:03,900
Yes, well it a... was most decidedly tricky for a minute or two.

234
00:20:04,777 --> 00:20:08,755
Yes, Thomni, you can signal the monks, they can return.

235
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,711
Doctor, are you trying to tell me that 
that old man was responsible for all this? 

236
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,000
- The Yeti? The cave? 
- Oh no, no, no.

237
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,755
He was just a tool in the hands of a monstrous brain.

238
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,822
It wasn't his fault.

239
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:31,622
It's horrible, let's get away from here.

240
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:33,377
Aye, come on.

241
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:46,374
Please Doctor, our Abbot will be most grieved 
that he did not thank you personally. Will you not wait?

242
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:49,650
Ah no, Thomni, we're anxious to get back to the TARD...

243
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,488
We're anxious to get back.

244
00:20:52,755 --> 00:20:53,866
Goodbye, Doctor.

245
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,933
I'll see them safely up the mountain.

246
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,080
Goodbye, Thomni.

247
00:20:58,622 --> 00:21:00,066
Goodbye.

248
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:02,790
Bye, Thomni.

249
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:18,600
Aye, well those things won't bother us anymore, Doctor.

250
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,550
Those horrible things.

251
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,570
Ah, they were clever machines.

252
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,400
Almost a pity to have had them destroyed.

253
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:29,822
Well at least you'll have something to take home from your expedition, Mr Travers.

254
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,970
I suppose so.

255
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:34,688
But nobody would believe me, they'd think I'd had it made.

256
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:38,450
No, I'm afraid the expedition's over now.

257
00:21:38,777 --> 00:21:40,533
Oh Doctor, look!

258
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,111
- Oh no! 
- It can't be!

259
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,133
A Yeti! A real Yeti! At last!

260
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:56,000
'scuse the haste. Goodbye and all that. Mustn't lose this one.

261
00:21:57,844 --> 00:22:00,488
Do you think he'll ever find his abominable snowman, Doctor?

262
00:22:00,644 --> 00:22:02,044
Well that we shall never know, Jamie.

263
00:22:02,244 --> 00:22:04,133
What's the matter with you, are you cold or something?

264
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:06,800
Oh it's all right for you in your home-made Yeti kit.

265
00:22:07,044 --> 00:22:09,422
Yes, I suppose there is a little bit of a nip in the air.

266
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,244
A nip! A nip, just look at my knees, they're bright blue.

267
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:14,180
A horrible sight.

268
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:16,533
Could you not land us somewhere warmer next time?

269
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:20,020
Jamie, you never know, do you?
