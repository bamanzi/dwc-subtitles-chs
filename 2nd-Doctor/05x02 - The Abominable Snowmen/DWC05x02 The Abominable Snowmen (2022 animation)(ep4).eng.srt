1
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:28,007
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,660
Oh no! Thomni! Help, Thomni!

3
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,660
Run, Miss Victoria, run! Fetch Khrisong.

4
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,550
The Yeti! The Yeti! Fetch help! Where's Khrisong?

5
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,200
But where is Thomni? What has happened?

6
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,640
He's in there. He's coming, now hurry!

7
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,490
- Khrisong, the Yeti, it is alive!   - What!

8
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,650
It's true Khrisong! Quick, it's coming, do something!

9
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,370
Get back! Get back!

10
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,000
Ralpachan, help him! Get him! Get up!

11
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,200
We can't stop it! Get a net!

12
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,230
No, we must destroy it!

13
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,930
What's the matter, Doctor?

14
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,320
Oh, I'm just taking a breather, that's all.

15
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,410
You've heard something?

16
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,150
No, no, nothing.

17
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,290
Well come on then!

18
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:22,370
Listen.

19
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,330
Nothing.

20
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,066
Yes, that's what's worrying me. It's too quite.

21
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,860
We've not seen a sign of the Yeti
since we left those three back there.

22
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,940
Aye, well lets just be grateful and get to the TARDIS.

23
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,050
I don't like it. There's something happening on this mountain.

24
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:41,840
I can feel it.

25
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,320
Hey, you're giving me the willies. Come on.

26
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,380
Look, Doctor!

27
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,190
Thought we'd been too lucky.

28
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,280
What now?
Thought we'd been too lucky.

29
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,960
What now?

30
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,170
I don't know. We've got to get to the TARDIS somehow.

31
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,140
Aye, well you can't frighten one of those things away.

32
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,200
No.

33
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,280
I wonder what he's waiting for?

34
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,940
Um.

35
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,810
Well he couldn't have known we were coming.

36
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:12,120
It's a robot, Jamie. It merely follows instructions.

37
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,310
Who's giving them?

38
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,700
That we shall have to find out, won't we?

39
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,240
Get down, Doctor!

40
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:29,490
Oh, Great Intelligence, have I served you well?

41
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:40,533
After so many years, can I feel the grip of your power loosen?

42
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:52,933
How long before your great experiment begins and I can rest?

43
00:04:54,066 --> 00:05:03,900
So soon? I am not sorry. What of the others?

44
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:18,620
It will be done. Songsten is making final preparations.

45
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,155
Yes.

46
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:30,800
Have you thought up some clever plan, Doctor?

47
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:32,800
Yes, Jamie, I believe I have.

48
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,222
What are you going to do?

49
00:06:34,422 --> 00:06:35,666
Bung a rock at it.

50
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:37,333
Oh be serious, Doctor!

51
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:38,644
Jamie, I am.

52
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:41,622
Hey no, Doctor!

53
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,733
There you are, you see? Just as I thought.

54
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:49,266
It can't see and it can't feel. Come on.

55
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,890
Don't be daft, Doctor.

56
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,488
Well it's quite all right, Jamie.
It's like those three back there,

57
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,955
it's either switched off or not receiving. Come along.

58
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,555
Are you sure it's quite safe?

59
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:04,220
Well quite frankly no, Jamie.
But there's only one way of finding out.

60
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:15,311
Don't, Doctor, you might switch it on.

61
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,733
No I don't think so, Jamie.

62
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,066
Yes, just as I thought. Now then.

63
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:35,644
Now, Jamie, will you hold this flap open for me please. Thank you.

64
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:44,555
Hey you're taking an awful risk, Doctor.

65
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:58,688
Well I'm glad that's over. Catch!

66
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:02,661
Hey I just thought of something, Doctor.

67
00:08:02,844 --> 00:08:05,220
The man that made these robots is very clever, right?

68
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,911
- Yes.
- And yet we were able to walk right up to it...

69
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,890
... and put it out of action just like that!

70
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:13,933
- You mean why didn't they build in some sort of protective device?
- Aye.

71
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:17,220
Well perhaps they didn't think it was necessary.
I mean look at him.

72
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:20,933
Would you walk up to a creature like that
with just a screwdriver in your hand?

73
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,933
- No I would not.  - No there you are.

74
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:25,420
I'm really rather pleased with myself.

75
00:09:07,688 --> 00:09:09,066
Aaahh!

76
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,288
Have you not found it yet?

77
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:17,800
Yes, Jamie. Sorry, I'm just coming.

78
00:09:24,644 --> 00:09:27,066
Hey Doctor! Look!

79
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:30,500
Ah, splendid! Splendid, it's sending out signal.

80
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:32,155
That's just what we wanted.

81
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:33,888
Hey Doctor, you'll have to help me, I'll let go!

82
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:36,400
Oh no, you mustn't do that. Jamie, no!

83
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,111
It's no use, I'll have to let go.

84
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,266
Whatever happens, you mustn't let go Jamie!

85
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:42,533
It's no use, Doctor!

86
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,911
No!

87
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,066
Jamie get a rock!

88
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,510
- What?  - A rock!

89
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:53,800
Put it in the hole in its chest!

90
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:10,666
You all right, Doctor?

91
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:15,377
Yes, I'm all right. Just a bit puffed, that's all.

92
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,488
Jamie, these things are programmed to return to their Yetis!

93
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,290
That one that disappeared in the monastery!

94
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:26,777
- That wasn't taken!  - It moved itself!

95
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,066
It could have got to the Yeti! The one we captured. Come on!

96
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,866
You deliberately disobeyed my orders!

97
00:10:35,044 --> 00:10:36,666
- It was the only sensible thing to do...
- Be silent!

98
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,888
If you had not opened the gate the creature would not have escaped.

99
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,600
Khrisong, you know we couldn't stop it.
You'd have been killed!

100
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:44,000
Anyway it was my idea to open the gates.

101
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:49,488
Was it? Was it also your idea to breath life into the Yeti?

102
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,711
What do you mean?

103
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:53,511
Were you not with the creature when it came to life?

104
00:10:53,622 --> 00:10:55,400
- Yes, but...
- You think that she was...

105
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,130
- Who else could have done this?
- Oh, this is foolish!

106
00:10:57,244 --> 00:11:01,090
- Continue, Rinchen.  - The creature was here, dead.

107
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,177
What reason had you to enter this room?

108
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:08,288
- I was hiding.  - Hiding? Why?

109
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:09,711
For what purpose?

110
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:12,066
Speak!

111
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:13,711
- She means no harm...  - Be silent!

112
00:11:13,822 --> 00:11:16,888
Your young warrior seems too anxious to protect this stranger.

113
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:18,866
- What are they plotting, these two?  -  No!

114
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:20,420
You do not understand!

115
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:23,167
Where is your authority, Khrisong,

116
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:25,820
... that your warriors forget their allegiance?

117
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:28,366
Lock them up!

118
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,088
- Hey Doctor!  - What is it?

119
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,800
It's started again! The signal's started.

120
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:37,155
No! No that's another sort of signal.

121
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:53,533
Jamie, I've just picked up another signal!

122
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,933
Oh, Doctor, let's get to the monastery.

123
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:56,733
You said you do all your tracking from there.

124
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,244
- Jamie, you don't seem to understand.
- Oh don't I though!

125
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,488
While you're fiddling with that thing,
this sphere is calling up all the Yeti in creation.

126
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:06,711
What a perfect opportunity to trace the main transmitter.

127
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:10,666
A perfect opportunity to get ourselves killed.

128
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,450
I wish the Doctor would come back.

129
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:26,800
This... a... Doctor, is he your guardian?

130
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,230
I suppose he is in a way.

131
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:30,955
He is a good man?

132
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:32,390
I think so.

133
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,733
Tell me, Miss Victoria, how did he come by our holy bell?

134
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,400
I don't really know. Why?

135
00:12:38,488 --> 00:12:40,290
It disappeared three hundred years ago.

136
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,022
- Oh stolen, you mean?
- No it was given to a stranger,

137
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:47,377
... for safe keeping during a time of trouble. It was never returned.

138
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,311
A stranger? Of course, the Doctor.

139
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:53,810
They're one and the same man.

140
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,711
- But three hundred years?
- Oh dear. Well I know this sounds silly...

141
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,888
but the Doctor can travel through time and space.

142
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:07,511
He has a machine you see and... and well...
I don't really understand it myself.

143
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:11,511
- It's rather difficult to explain.
- There is no need, I understand perfectly.

144
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,488
- You do?
- Yes. You see, it is said that our Master, Padmasambhava,

145
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:21,320
... can free himself from his earthly body and travel great distances.

146
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:22,490
Oh!

147
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:29,690
This can only be obtained after many years
of strict discipline and self training.

148
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:33,630
You mean... that you might be able to do that sort of thing?

149
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,010
Perhaps, one day.

150
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Rinchen, where is Songsten?

151
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,210
No one has seen him for many hours.
He will be with Padmasambhava.

152
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,380
Padmasambhava?

153
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:48,290
- To seek guidance.
- Or is it to escape his responsibilities?

154
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,066
- Khrisong, you should not say such things.
- Why not?

155
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,066
Has anyone seen Padmasambhava?

156
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,666
Ralpachan! Inform me when the Doctor returns!

157
00:13:58,244 --> 00:14:02,177
Khrisong would be wise not to voice such thoughts.

158
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:08,410
Perhaps, but brave men are impatient. And he is no fool.

159
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:36,066
Sleep, Ralpachan. You have not seen me.

160
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,155
You have not opened the gate. No one has entered.

161
00:14:41,844 --> 00:14:47,288
When I leave the courtyard you will not know that you have slept.

162
00:14:58,977 --> 00:15:04,177
You have done well, Songsten.

163
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:13,555
Already the Great Intelligence begins to take on material form.

164
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:27,400
But it demands more. It must expand.

165
00:15:29,377 --> 00:15:40,733
THAT IS WHY YOU AND OUR BROTHERS MUST DEPART FROM THIS PLACE.

166
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:46,666
Leave the monastery, Master. I understand.

167
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:56,111
- And the strangers?
- The strangers, oh yes.

168
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:07,533
I will tell you how to deal with them... if they return.

169
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,711
- I wish this thing would keep quiet.
- Not much further.

170
00:16:13,488 --> 00:16:18,355
- Well, we were expecting it.
- Now what do we do?

171
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:24,066
Trapped!  -

172
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:30,066
Jamie, give me the sphere. Give me the box.

173
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:33,486
- What now?  - Follow me slowly.

174
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:37,422
Jamie, when I say run, run.

175
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:39,666
Run like the wind. Don't worry about me.

176
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,480
- Doctor...  - Now, Jamie, please.

177
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,466
- No heroics, Jamie.   - But surely, Doctor...

178
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,866
Now Jamie! Run! Run!

179
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:50,066
I know what I'm doing - I hope!

180
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,977
It worked!

181
00:17:19,844 --> 00:17:21,721
It's no use, Miss Victoria.

182
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,177
Even if Padmasambhava would consent to see us, we can't get out.

183
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,111
Can't? We haven't even tried.

184
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,488
Thank you, Ralpachan.

185
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,866
I am sorry about this, Thomni.

186
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:42,800
Oh, good. I am thirsty.

187
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:50,022
Urgh! A funny taste.

188
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:55,822
- Oh, Ralpachan, has the Doctor... oah!
- Miss Victoria, what is it?

189
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,044
No, no, no don't touch it. The drink. No... oah!

190
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,800
Miss Victoria!

191
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:13,400
I will fetch some water. Stay close to her, Thomni.

192
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:17,044
Miss Victoria.

193
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:34,155
Miss Victoria!

194
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:36,511
I'm sorry, Thomni.

195
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,686
Miss Victoria!

196
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:45,622
And in his wisdom our Master, Padmasambhava,
has given me his guidance.

197
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:48,787
We must all leave the monastery.

198
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:52,440
It is impossible for us to defeat the Yeti.

199
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,266
- But there may be a way. The Doctor...
- No my son, they are invincible.

200
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,488
They will destroy us all.

201
00:18:58,844 --> 00:19:02,380
Therefore in order to avoid further bloodshed it has been decided...

202
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,155
Songsten, I have just been informed that the Doctor has returned.

203
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:08,844
He brings with him equipment which will help us to defeat these monsters!

204
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,755
- Khrisong, the Master...  - The Master?

205
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,555
My apologies, Abbot. I have felt the strength of these Yeti...

206
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:20,020
but still I will not meekly turn away. I mean to fight!

207
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,466
Brothers, Khrisong thinks only of our safety, we know,

208
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,066
but in this matter he has been led astray.

209
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,244
He has forgotten his vow of obedience.

210
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,488
- In due time he will realise his...
- Master Abbot,

211
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:39,066
The girl has escaped. She tricked us by feigning sickness.

212
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,066
- She is a devil women!
- She must be found.

213
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:42,977
Find her, my brothers!

214
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,000
We had no defence against it,
yet it just walked through the gates.

215
00:19:50,177 --> 00:19:52,270
Doctor, we must act quickly or the Abbot will prevent us.

216
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,760
- Yes, but is Victoria all right?
- I did as you asked, she is locked up.

217
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,466
- Is this your equipment?  - Yes.

218
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:57,966
Stand aside!

219
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:01,266
- Travers!  - Thank heavens!

220
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:05,133
Doctor... up there... the pyramid.

221
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:06,911
- Well what's he saying?
- Shh! Go on. Go on.

222
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,377
The pyramid... it's a...

223
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:14,410
Seize them! Seize the strangers!

224
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:18,066
Khrisong, the girl has escaped. She is a devil woman!

225
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:19,333
Victoria! Hey what's happened?

226
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,066
- Take these people to...  - No!

227
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,022
These people can help us. Besides this man is ill.

228
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:24,577
I cannot allow it!

229
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:28,311
Khrisong, you will obey.

230
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:31,200
- Take them.  - No, but...

231
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,066
- Where is Victoria?
- Doctor, what did he mean 'a devil woman'?

232
00:20:33,244 --> 00:20:35,800
- What is this about Victoria? Where is she?
- Where are you taking us?

233
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:39,533
- I cannot allow this!  - You cannot allow?

234
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,644
These are the orders of our Master, you must obey.

235
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:44,711
But these people can help us!

236
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,711
The Master tells us that there is no help against the Yeti.

237
00:20:47,911 --> 00:20:51,666
- He tells us to leave.  - We will not leave!

238
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:56,222
Khrisong, do not defy me.

239
00:20:56,577 --> 00:21:00,600
Find the girl. Instruct your warriors.

240
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:13,711
Go after them Sapan.

241
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,977
Advise me Padmasambhava.

242
00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:28,980
Khrisong turns his warriors away from the path of obedience

243
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:37,266
I hear, Songsten, and I understand.

244
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,777
Well if they will not be lead,

245
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:51,240
then they must be driven from the monastery.

246
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:58,933
This is what you must do.

247
00:22:00,577 --> 00:22:04,266
I understand, Master.

248
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:15,066
Help them search for the girl. Go quickly!

249
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:51,955
Come in, my child,

250
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:08,311
Come in...

251
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:20,333
...You have no alternative.
