1
00:00:48,868 --> 00:00:50,582
<i>Who are you?</i>

2
00:00:53,936 --> 00:00:56,887
<i>Who are you?</i>

3
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:59,511
<i>AnswerI</i>

4
00:01:33,763 --> 00:01:36,555
- Why are you being so cautious?
- Ssh!

5
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:39,463
They left the door open for us, didn't they?

6
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:46,364
- It's half past the nine o'clock.
- Yes, I know.

7
00:01:46,534 --> 00:01:50,200
They made the appointment for ten.
Why have we come early?

8
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:57,182
The early bird catches the worm, Jamie.
Do be quiet, there's a good chap.

9
00:01:57,348 --> 00:01:59,811
And don't knock into anything.

10
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:04,604
Ssh!

11
00:02:06,088 --> 00:02:08,074
Any good, this?

12
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:10,910
It's interesting.

13
00:02:11,076 --> 00:02:14,141
In fact, Jamie, it's quite remarkable.

14
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:18,054
You told me outside it said
"Genuine Victorian Antiques".

15
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,444
All the stuff in here is brand new!

16
00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:23,996
- You noticed that.
- Of course I did. The man's a rogue.

17
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,641
Yes, so it seems.

18
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:28,593
- Except...
- Except what?

19
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:34,419
Except that all these things are not reproductions.
They're all genuine.

20
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:37,567
- That's ridiculous!
- Look at this.

21
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:41,318
"To one deed box, four guineas. "

22
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:46,706
This is a bill from William Deering and Son. 1866.

23
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:50,743
- Then it's a forgery.
- If you were going to make a forgery,

24
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:52,969
wouldn't you dirty it up a bit?

25
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:56,645
Yellow the edges, crinkle it up?
This is brand-new.

26
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,682
- I've got an idea.
- What?

27
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,399
- All the stuff in here is genuine...
- Yes.

28
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,545
-.. but brand-new.
- Well done.

29
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:08,379
That is impossible, unless Waterfield
could have invented a time machine,

30
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:12,004
and he's bringing this stuff back
from Victorian times.

31
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:17,713
It's not very likely, but the only way
to find out is to ask Waterfield.

32
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:29,963
Kennedy!

33
00:03:36,637 --> 00:03:37,953
What happened?

34
00:03:38,113 --> 00:03:41,859
<i>The human discovered
our communication system.</i>

35
00:03:42,024 --> 00:03:45,089
<i>- And you murdered him?
- He would have betrayed us.</i>

36
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:47,368
<i>- You don't have to kill!
- SilenceI</i>

37
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:52,469
What are you dragging me into? You took
a human life. Don't you understand that?

38
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,431
<i>- That is of no consequence.
- No consequence?</i>

39
00:03:55,593 --> 00:03:59,973
<i>There is only one form of life that matters.</i>

40
00:04:00,142 --> 00:04:01,776
<i>Dalek life.</i>

41
00:04:01,938 --> 00:04:05,717
<i>Obey your orders, WaterfieldI</i>

42
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:13,150
No, wait! What am I to do with the body?

43
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,216
I can't...

44
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:18,291
I can't go on with this.

45
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:23,802
I'm sure I heard somebody shouting.

46
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,075
- We've got to get in.
- Use the wire.

47
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:29,111
It's too pliable.

48
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:05,660
- Boo!
- Oh! What are you doing here?

49
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:08,620
- You made the appointment!
- For ten o'clock.

50
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:11,926
We thought we'd be early.
What are you doing here?

51
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:15,397
- I work here.
- Then what are you creeping about for?

52
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:19,709
I think you've got some explaining to do,
Mr Kenneth Perry!

53
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:23,985
My name isn't Kenneth. It's Keith.
Look, I don't understand this.

54
00:05:24,146 --> 00:05:27,494
It's Keith... Do you know a man called Bob Hall?

55
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:29,848
He's a man Mr Waterfield employs.

56
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:33,882
He keeps some very rough company,
including a man called Ken.

57
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,347
- Ken? Kennedy!
- What?

58
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:39,468
- What do you know about Kennedy?
- Wait a minute.

59
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,932
I'll answer your questions if you'll answer mine.

60
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:19,846
This old police box was for a collector of curios.

61
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:22,967
- It belongs to me!
- Why is it so important to you?

62
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:26,193
Because of what's inside it, and it's my property.

63
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:28,869
- Where is it?
- At the back.

64
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:33,177
- How do we get through?
- We might be able to get over the yard gates.

65
00:06:33,345 --> 00:06:38,487
- This door has an electric lock on it.
- You're going to show me where this yard is.

66
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:41,796
If it's a police box, shouldn't we get the police?

67
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:43,951
Doctor!

68
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,111
That's Kennedy!

69
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,059
He's dead.

70
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:10,332
- What are you doing?
- Getting the police.

71
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:14,482
Don't touch anything.

72
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:17,203
I'll be as quick as I can.

73
00:07:17,362 --> 00:07:19,666
- Should we have let him go?
- He's right.

74
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:23,503
- But the Tardis!
- We'll have to find it before he comes back.

75
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:26,539
I wonder what this telephone interference is.

76
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:31,558
- Looks as if Waterfield's cleared out.
- Why make an appointment to see us at ten?

77
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:36,837
He didn't know he was going to have a fight
with Kennedy. Let's find the Tardis and go!

78
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:39,380
Yes, the Tardis...

79
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,980
How did he die?

80
00:07:41,147 --> 00:07:43,893
His limbs are stiff, his hands clenched...

81
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,807
He died in horrible agony. Look at his face.

82
00:07:46,973 --> 00:07:49,243
- Hello...
- What?

83
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,908
- It's your picture!
- Yes.

84
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,216
Now, he fell like that, with his arm stretched out.

85
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:08,078
Go out into the hall,
and measure the length of it up to the door here.

86
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,605
- 14... 15.
- It's only five from the door to the wall.

87
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,675
There must be another room behind here.

88
00:08:29,713 --> 00:08:31,938
Hey, Doctor! There's a keyhole.

89
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:35,539
You're right. Waterfield will have the key.

90
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,809
We'd better find something to prise it open with.

91
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:54,171
Well...

92
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:57,081
Look at this.

93
00:08:57,249 --> 00:09:01,119
That's where your telephone interference
is coming from.

94
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:04,862
This is interesting.

95
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:08,538
- Hey! The other half of your picture!
- Don't open that!

96
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:20,111
This way. Along here.

97
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:32,319
Here we are.

98
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:37,266
That's funny... There were a couple
of other gentlemen here.

99
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:42,055
They seem to have... disappeared.

100
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,618
Hello, sir.

101
00:10:15,786 --> 00:10:17,851
Are you feeling better?

102
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:21,323
Oh, you did have a party last night,
didn't you, sir!

103
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:26,200
- The master sent this in for you.
- The master?

104
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:29,948
- Mr Waterfield?
- No, sir. Mr Maxtible.

105
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:35,334
Mr Waterfield came back from abroad last night,
sir, with you and the young gentleman.

106
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,802
- Don't you remember?
- Not very well, no.

107
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:41,924
Ooh!

108
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:43,639
I'd best not wake him.

109
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:46,990
- What's your name?
- Mollie Dawson, sir.

110
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:51,455
- This stuff works remarkably quickly.
- Am I to pour some more?

111
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:56,401
No, thank you, Mollie,
but you can tell me what the date is.

112
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:58,159
- The date?
- Yes.

113
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:00,789
I am feeling very much better,

114
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:05,898
but I don't seem to be able
to remember the date and where I am.

115
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:08,531
Mollie, that will do.

116
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,686
The answers you require, sir,
might come better from me.

117
00:11:13,851 --> 00:11:17,959
My name is Theodore Maxtible,
and I am the owner of this house.

118
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:20,186
Pray don't get up.

119
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:24,305
I have the greatest sympathy for your condition

120
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:27,814
since I was the cause of it.

121
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:31,280
And this is Mr Edward Waterfield, I presume.

122
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:36,316
- You don't keep appointments, do you?
- There were circumstances.

123
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:41,494
- Yes, there were!
- Please, Doctor. First things first.

124
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,696
You asked what date it was and where you were.

125
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:46,685
Yes. Well?

126
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:49,884
You're in my house,
some miles from Canterbury.

127
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:55,506
The date is June 2nd 1866.

128
00:11:56,392 --> 00:11:59,535
What do you think you're up to?
You steal my property,

129
00:11:59,704 --> 00:12:02,258
spirit Jamie and me 100 years back in time

130
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:05,720
- and murder a man along the way.
- We didn't kill him.

131
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:08,874
- I don't believe you.
- You will believe, Doctor.

132
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:11,550
All of us are victims of a higher power.

133
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:15,620
A power more evil and terrible
than the human brain can imagine.

134
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:18,578
Power? Victims? What do you mean?

135
00:12:19,418 --> 00:12:22,244
- They've taken my daughter Victoria.
- Who?

136
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:26,031
You will not be kept in suspense
very much longer, Doctor.

137
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:31,821
Pray come with us,
and we will show you how it all began.

138
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:37,608
Doctor, do whatever it is that they ask.
I beg of you.

139
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:40,760
My daughter's life is in your hands.

140
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:44,514
I will listen. I promise.

141
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:51,335
Is er... Is that your daughter?

142
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:55,850
No, sir. That is a painting
of my wife as a young girl.

143
00:12:56,013 --> 00:13:00,235
She is dead now, rest her soul,
but Victoria is the image of her.

144
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:21,583
<i>You have not eaten.</i>

145
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,051
<i>You will eat. That is an order. AnswerI</i>

146
00:13:28,297 --> 00:13:29,852
Yes.

147
00:13:30,013 --> 00:13:34,315
<i>You will not feed the flying pests outside.</i>

148
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:36,151
<i>AnswerI</i>

149
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:38,033
Yes.

150
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:40,498
<i>Move to the machine.</i>

151
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:42,655
<i>MoveI</i>

152
00:13:56,232 --> 00:13:58,219
No.

153
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:03,965
<i>MoveI</i>

154
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,120
<i>MoveI</i>

155
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:17,938
<i>The weight of your body
has fallen by 17 ounces.</i>

156
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:21,733
What do you expect?

157
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:25,762
What do you expect?
For pity's sake, let me go!

158
00:14:25,923 --> 00:14:28,953
<i>Speak when you are told to speakI</i>

159
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:34,095
<i>More food will come.</i>

160
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:37,725
<i>Eat it, or you will be fed by forceI</i>

161
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:05,462
Here we are, Doctor. This is hallowed ground.

162
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:09,333
Here we shall not be disturbed
by the servants.

163
00:15:11,018 --> 00:15:16,443
Yes, very impressive.
Now perhaps you'll explain what all this is about?

164
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:20,112
- Patience, my dear sir.
- Patience?!

165
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:25,577
A man has been murdered! You behave
as if we're going on a Sunday School outing.

166
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:30,170
Neither Waterfield nor I
were responsible for his death. Cigar?

167
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:32,917
Why have you brought us here?

168
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:36,956
Who are these enemies of yours,
these ones you say control you?

169
00:15:37,117 --> 00:15:40,182
- Brilliant minds, Doctor.
- They are monsters!

170
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:44,810
- I admit, they have behaved callously.
- Inhuman monsters!

171
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:47,282
- Inhuman?
- Creations of the devil!

172
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:50,324
- Let me explain.
- Please do!

173
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:57,263
I've always been fascinated
by the concept of travelling through time.

174
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:03,288
Waterfield here is an expert
in certain technical matters,

175
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:06,565
and I have the money to indulge my whims.

176
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:11,586
Everything you see about you
was constructed by us two.

177
00:16:11,756 --> 00:16:15,978
- To try to find a way of exploring time?
- Yes.

178
00:16:16,146 --> 00:16:17,814
Now, this is my theory.

179
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:21,648
- A mirror reflects an image, does it not?
- Yes.

180
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:27,272
So, you may be standing there
and yet appear to be standing 50 feet away.

181
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,788
Following the new investigations 12 years ago

182
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:34,697
by J Clark Maxwell into electromagnetism,

183
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:39,924
and the experiments by Faraday
into static electricity...

184
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,360
- Static?
- Correct.

185
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:46,985
.. Waterfield and I first attempted
to define the image in the mirror,

186
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:49,708
and then to project it.

187
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:57,361
In here, Doctor, are 144 separate mirrors.

188
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:02,433
Each is of polished metal. Each is subjected
to electric charges, all positive.

189
00:17:02,598 --> 00:17:05,424
Like repels like in electricity, Doctor,

190
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:10,210
and so we attempted to repel the image
in the mirrors wherever we directed.

191
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:14,681
- You mentioned static electricity...
- That was our last experiment.

192
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:19,151
Negative and positive electricity had failed,
so we tried static.

193
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,781
- We didn't know the powers we'd unleash.
- Powers?

194
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:28,012
In the middle of our final test with static,
creatures burst out of the cabinet,

195
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:32,082
invaded the house and took away my daughter.

196
00:17:32,248 --> 00:17:35,869
Oh, my dear fellow! My dear, dear fellow!

197
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,025
We shall win through now that the Doctor is here.

198
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,860
These creatures...

199
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:44,172
We had opened the way for them
with our experiments.

200
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,246
They forced me into the horror of time travel.

201
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:50,398
They ordered me to steal a box belonging to you

202
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:55,390
and thus lure you into a trap
and transport you here with Mr McCrimmon.

203
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:58,744
- They knew about me?
- They gave us likenesses.

204
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:01,971
What could I do?
They said my daughter would die.

205
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:07,155
<i>- What are they called, these creatures?
- DoctorI</i>

206
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:11,915
<i>Now do you understand?</i>

207
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:15,783
Oh, yes. Perfectly.

208
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:18,691
<i>Move backI</i>

209
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,684
<i>Our plan has worked.</i>

210
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:26,597
<i>- We shall triumphI You will obeyI
- Obey? What do you want?</i>

211
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:29,349
<i>We have your time ship. We will destroy it</i>

212
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:33,056
<i>- unless you help us with an experiment.
- What experiment?</i>

213
00:18:33,226 --> 00:18:37,607
<i>- You will help us test another human being.
- What sort of test?</i>

214
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,841
<i>- No questionsI
- I am not a slave!</i>

215
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:44,676
<i>- Doctor, I beg you...
- No harm will come to you if you agree.</i>

216
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,393
<i>Where is your companion?</i>

217
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,936
- Jamie?
- He is in the house.

218
00:18:51,105 --> 00:18:55,531
- I have done everything you asked me to.
- Why do you ask about Jamie?

219
00:18:55,694 --> 00:19:01,596
<i>- He is the human being who is to be tested.
- What do you mean? Tested how?</i>

220
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,028
<i>SilenceI You will reveal nothing
to your companion.</i>

221
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:09,572
<i>Obey the DaleksI You are in our powerI</i>

222
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:17,958
What have you done with your infernal meddling?

223
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:24,578
What is this test?

224
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:27,933
- Do either of you know?
- No.

225
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:30,561
I believe I do.

226
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:35,715
They, I mean the Daleks, tell me
they've always been defeated by human beings.

227
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,196
In the long run, yes.

228
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:40,500
Possibly because of some factor
possessed by humans

229
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:43,053
- that is absent in Daleks?
- Possibly.

230
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:47,729
Perhaps they want to find out what it is,
and transplant it into their race?

231
00:19:47,892 --> 00:19:53,670
But if they do do that, they'll be invincible!
Maxtible, you should have...

232
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:58,901
My dear fellow, I am merely surmising.
I know nothing definite.

233
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:03,209
Besides, what could we have done,
even if I had known for certain?

234
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:07,917
The fact was, nay, is,
they hold your daughter Victoria.

235
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:09,992
And now they've got Jamie.

236
00:20:12,954 --> 00:20:15,905
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to wake you.

237
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,608
It's not funny.

238
00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:23,965
The master left this for you to drink, sir.

239
00:20:24,128 --> 00:20:26,353
This'll clear away the cobwebs.

240
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:29,030
- Here you are, sir.
- Where's the Doctor?

241
00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:33,066
- He's with the master and Mr Waterfield.
- Waterfield?

242
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:37,415
- What are you doing here?
- Just seeing to the young gentleman, miss.

243
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:39,086
Go and bring some tea.

244
00:20:39,252 --> 00:20:41,681
Well, go along.

245
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,228
- Please, Mr McCrimmon.
- You know my name?

246
00:20:48,391 --> 00:20:53,295
My father told me that you and your friend
arrived last night with Mr Waterfield.

247
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:57,727
Your father? I seem to have great difficulty
in remembering anything.

248
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,205
He owns this house.

249
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:02,827
- I'm his daughter, Ruth Maxtible.
- How do you do?

250
00:21:02,997 --> 00:21:07,582
- Have you seen the Doctor?
- He's with my father. He'll be along presently.

251
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:12,048
- Do you have all you need?
- Whatever this stuff is, it works all right.

252
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:15,007
- You shall have some tea.
- I'm obliged to you.

253
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:16,883
- Miss Maxtible.
- Yes?

254
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:21,982
- Could you tell me who that is in the portrait?
- That's Mr Waterfield's late wife.

255
00:21:22,152 --> 00:21:27,090
- She is very lovely.
- Yes, and his daughter looks just like her.

256
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:31,167
- You're quite comfortable?
- Yes, thank you.

257
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,395
1866.

258
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:55,512
So that's what Waterfield's done.

259
00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:36,373
Here we are, sir. I've been as quick as I could.

260
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,809
Shall I pour for you?

261
00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:49,986
Poor young gentleman.
They shouldn't have given you so much to drink.

262
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,080
- Doctor... I do ask you to consider.
- I have made up my mind.

263
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,519
But they ordered you
not to tell your friend anything.

264
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:04,985
Do you think I will allow Jamie
to run into danger? No, I will not.

265
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:09,022
- Suppose he refuses to do what they want?
- We shall see.

266
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,246
He's still asleep.

267
00:23:12,415 --> 00:23:15,480
The gas in that box of yours was pretty potent.

268
00:23:15,648 --> 00:23:18,110
It was Maxtible's invention.

269
00:23:23,031 --> 00:23:25,936
- Jamie...
- Mollie!

270
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,849
<i>Order the Doctor to begin the test.</i>

271
00:23:31,012 --> 00:23:33,997
But I must first explain to him
what he has to do.

272
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:36,276
<i>Go now. Obey the DaleksI</i>

273
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:42,026
But your friend is vital to the plan of these Daleks.
Absolutely essential.

274
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:45,012
So it seems. So who can have kidnapped him?

275
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,287
The threats they make are not idle ones.
Kennedy was murdered.

276
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:53,675
Without your friend, our only hope is gone...

277
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,267
unless... unless you know something.

278
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:01,017
You seem to be well acquainted
with the creatures.

279
00:24:01,182 --> 00:24:03,928
Everything you say, Waterfield, is true.

280
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:09,759
If we cannot find Jamie, the Daleks
will take pleasure in killing everyone in sight,

281
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:13,508
and their greatest pleasure will be in killing me.

282
00:24:13,673 --> 00:24:17,895
<i>The humans have been told
to begin the test.</i>

283
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:21,444
<i>Any delay will result in death.</i>

284
00:24:21,614 --> 00:24:23,407
<i>There will be no delayI</i>
