1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:04,595
Miss Waterfield? Can you open the door? We've come to get you.

3
00:01:26,975 --> 00:01:29,999
Quick, before we see any more of those mechanical beasties.

4
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:42,721
Kemel, my dear friend!

5
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,557
Aye, he's a good friend, right enough, Miss Waterfield.

6
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,584
And you?

7
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:55,193
Er... Introductions in a moment, if you please. First, I'd like to make us a little bit more secure. Kemel, if we lash this bedstead across the door, it might just hold.

8
00:01:56,732 --> 00:02:28,475
Rope! That's it. We could do with a chest against it, I'm thinking. Another one on top, eh? Well now, they can't get in and we can't get out. So, where does that put us? Oh. Jamie McCrimmon. I, uh... I came to give you this.

9
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:39,907
Are you sure you won't join me?

10
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,019
No, I won't. I very rarely touch it.

11
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:45,820
Oh, dear. W... Well, something else, perhaps?

12
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:46,830
No. Thank you.

13
00:02:47,046 --> 00:02:50,475
I know - let me ring for some food. Now, do join me?

14
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:55,903
No! You seem determined to involve me.

15
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,099
Yes. I do, don't I?

16
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:59,838
This is a large house. I prefer my own company.

17
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:01,480
Oh, how very unsociable.

18
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:07,212
Yes, possibly. No doubt you will enjoy your libation in one of the other rooms.

19
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:13,713
Liba...? Ah, Oh, no. Thank you. I'm... I'm perfectly happy here. Thank you. I'm perfectly happy.

20
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:26,859
What an extraordinary collection, isn't it? Hmm? Oh, I... I... I... I... I'm so sorry. I, uh... you... you didn't... You weren't in the mood for talking, were you?

21
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,833
Shouldn't you be helping Waterfield and Maxtible with their experiment?

22
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:35,599
He... he... yes, uh... But I thought I'd have a little rest. Uh... I wanted to talk to you.

23
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:36,729
About what, pray?

24
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:49,522
About you, Mr. Terrall. You interest me. Uh... Do you know something? Ever since I came to this house, I... This is Circassian, surely...

25
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,044
Do I know what?

26
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:52,150
Circassian?

27
00:03:52,849 --> 00:04:01,806
Ever since I came to this house, I have never seen you eat or drink anything. Now, that's curious, isn't it, hmm?

28
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:03,459
I dine alone.

29
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:07,540
Yes, I'd thought of that, but, uh... Waterfield has never seen you eat or drink either.

30
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:12,729
You, uh... seem to be a devotee of Edgar Allen Poe.

31
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,056
Oh, do I?

32
00:04:14,577 --> 00:04:16,143
However it...

33
00:04:16,408 --> 00:04:22,162
Ah, isn't wise to make assumptions, nor to meddle in affairs which are none of your business.

34
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:23,319
Touché.

35
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:32,818
Oh, look. A perfectly ordinary sword, and yet it appears to be magnetic. And see?

36
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:41,063
Directly you let go, it loses its magnetism. Now, if uh... if I didn't know better, Mr. Terrall, I'd say that you were full of some sort of electricity.

37
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:45,139
Doctor? Uh... excuse me. You're wanted.

38
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:48,233
Oh, hmm. Thank you. Excuse me.

39
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:55,047
Doctor! No doubt you are a keen student of human nature, but some things are better left alone.

40
00:04:55,288 --> 00:05:07,264
No, Mr. Terrall. I am not a student of human nature. I am a professor of a far wider academy, of which human nature is merely a part. All forms of life interest me.

41
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:13,531
I'm sorry to interrupt you Doctor, but it's something rather urgent.

42
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:41,891
Obey, obey, obey!

43
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:47,905
...and so the Doctor and I were brought to the house.

44
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:50,871
Why did you risk your life to try and rescue me?

45
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:53,216
Would you like some more water?

46
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:56,738
You are too modest. It was a silly question.

47
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:59,533
Then tell me, how did they come to capture you in the first place?

48
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:16,575
I don't remember. And yet, I seem to remember in the back of my mind, somebody - oh, I can't recall who it was - telling me to walk. And I obeyed, blindly and without interest.

49
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,042
Aye. Uh... you were drugged, maybe?

50
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:29,079
I simply don't know. The only thing I remember is waking up in a bare room with one of those terrible, terrible things.

51
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:32,404
Well, what do you remember before that, apart from this hazy recollection?

52
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:41,457
I was reading in the sitting room, but I couldn't concentrate, because I was so worried about Papa. I think I fell asleep over my book.

53
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:47,070
You see, how you came under the power of the Daleks is very important. They can't have done as much as they have without some help.

54
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:49,600
Help? From somebody in the house?

55
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:57,211
Yes, from someone who wants their plans to succeed - someone who drugged you or... or found a way of putting you under the power of the Daleks.

56
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,883
But how? How could it be done without my knowing?

57
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,578
You are paying attention Mollie?

58
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:05,619
Yes sir.

59
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:15,929
Then keep your eyes fixed on the jewel. See how the light catches it? Every facet sparkles, does it not?

60
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,108
Yes sir.

61
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:30,925
Flashing. Flashing, like a collection of sparks. But I know you are tired, Mollie. You are tired, are you not? Tell me.

62
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:33,752
I am tired.

63
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:57,738
Then close your eyes and sleep. You need have no fear, my child. A deep, heavy sleep. Oh, you are so exhausted. And now, in your sleep, you will hear only my voice.

64
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,530
Only your voice.

65
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:23,050
You have been dreaming, Mollie - dreaming that there are mysteries in this house - that all is not well. You have dreamt that you heard the voice of Miss Waterfield. But it was all your imagination. It was nothing but a dream. Do you understand?

66
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:25,698
Nothing but a dream.

67
00:08:25,994 --> 00:08:51,055
That is correct. Now, when I tell you to open your eyes, you will go back to your room and lie down on your bed. And when you awaken, the dream will fade and you will forget all your suspicions, for they might be injurious to your health. Now, open your eyes.

68
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:13,039
An excellent subject. I'd no idea that mesmerism was one of your accomplishments.

69
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:17,555
How else do you suppose that I persuaded Victoria to go to the Daleks?

70
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:21,749
I see. What of the experiment?

71
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:23,283
It progresses.

72
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,216
Are you sure of the Doctor?

73
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,407
No, but he is watched.

74
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,953
Mmm. And Waterfield?

75
00:09:31,186 --> 00:09:37,794
Waterfield's usefulness is nearing it's end. Your intervention in the stables was untimely.

76
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:43,615
Maxtible, help me!

77
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:45,482
What do you mean?

78
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:59,543
I... I seem to be in the grip of something. Sometimes my thoughts are clear; sometimes muddled. I... I don't know what's happened. Help me!

79
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:02,514
I can only help you if you obey me.

80
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:05,451
But I obey our masters.

81
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,434
I prefer to call them our colleagues. It is their wish that you should obey me.

82
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:15,752
You? But you would have killed Waterfield if they hadn't made me stop you.

83
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:42,938
A slight misunderstanding on the part of our friends. But now it is your turn to obey. I have a task for you to perform. This entrance leads to the south wing of my house and to a certain room. You will fetch Victoria Waterfield and bring her to me.

84
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:43,961
But, Maxtible...

85
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,193
Do as you are told.

86
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:58,058
Obey, obey, obey!

87
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:00,185
Well?

88
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:06,068
I will bring Victoria to you.

89
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,925
Is it finished?

90
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:28,831
Very nearly. Jamie was magnificent. But then, I knew he would be. He produced a whole battery of emotions; each one of which is imprinted in here. See?

91
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:30,843
The "Human Factor"?

92
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:42,456
Well, a part of it at least. The... the better part - courage, pity, chivalry, friendship, even compassion. Some of the virtues.

93
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:43,500
In there?

94
00:11:43,922 --> 00:11:51,792
Yes, it's a positronic brain. We're going to implant one of these into each of these three Daleks here. The dormant ones.

95
00:11:53,602 --> 00:11:55,146
So the end is in sight?

96
00:11:56,003 --> 00:11:57,099
Perhaps.

97
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,800
What happens when the capsule comes into contact with the brain of the Dalek and starts to influence it?

98
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:05,892
Perhaps it will drive them insane.

99
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:08,362
Or turn them into super-beings?

100
00:12:10,274 --> 00:12:20,541
Hmm. Well, that is their purpose. At least, I imagine it is. I can't help feeling that there's more in this than meets the eye.

101
00:12:25,784 --> 00:12:28,958
You have completed the experiment?

102
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:30,989
Yes, the three capsules are nearly ready.

103
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:36,175
Stand in front of the cabinet and speak when you have finished.

104
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:37,613
Yes, yes. I understand.

105
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:42,433
Doctor, be careful.

106
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:53,209
Doctor?

107
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:54,284
Hmm?

108
00:12:54,517 --> 00:12:56,368
You can't... you mustn't do it.

109
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,874
What do you mean?

110
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,240
You must stop the experiment.

111
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:02,184
Oh, you should have thought of that some time ago.

112
00:13:02,378 --> 00:13:03,071
I know.

113
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:04,375
It's no use having a conscience now.

114
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:05,805
But... before it's too late...

115
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:12,879
It was too late when they took away your daughter. It was too late when you stole my TARDIS and lured me to this house and this century.

116
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:19,512
Yes, but what are we doing? What are we really doing? Turning these creatures into super-beings.

117
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:22,229
Almost superior, anyway.

118
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,913
Adding what is best and finest in human nature to all that is brilliant and superior in them. They'll be unbeatable.

119
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:30,330
That is their purpose.

120
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:38,776
But you're making over the whole world to them. Don't you realise that? Our world, our future. They will enslave us for all time.

121
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:42,573
That, Mr. Waterfield, remains to be seen.

122
00:13:57,097 --> 00:14:17,755
Attacking me will do no good. Now, listen. You've done all of this because of your daughter. Jamie is with her now and they're both still in the power of the Daleks. They must be set free!

123
00:14:18,577 --> 00:14:28,519
And sacrifice a whole world - a history - past, present and future? Destroy an entire race?

124
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:37,609
Yes. I... I don't think you quite realise what you're saying. But yes, it may come to that. It may very well come to that.

125
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:48,039
So, with the Dalek's eye stick pointing forward, Kemel and I were able to tiptoe up behind him, throw the rope over his head and throw him into the fire.

126
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:53,099
What are they doing?

127
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:56,586
They must be trying to get through. You'd better stand back, Miss Waterfield.

128
00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:58,702
Why not break the door down? They're strong enough.

129
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:01,952
I don't know. Maybe they want us alive. I... I just don't know.

130
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:35,464
Is it hot? Aye, well, there's no smoke. Could be one of their newfangled inventions trying to melt their way through. Look, you'd better stand right back. Why didn't they try before this, is what I don't understand. Anyway, we'll make it as hard for them as we possibly can. Come on, Kemel. Excuse me. Take this. That's it. That one too. What's puzzling me is: there were two on the way up here, and there was a Dalek up here, and you were up...

131
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,041
Hey, Miss Waterfield!

132
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,312
Jamie!

133
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:45,421
Mmph!

134
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:52,282
Hey, did you hear it? Of course! Why didn't I use my head? There's another way in and out of here. Come on!

135
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:21,104
Oh, no. Two ways to go. Uh... Kemel, you go that way. If it's a dead end, follow me.

136
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:49,024
Right.

137
00:17:58,328 --> 00:17:59,676
Where's Victoria Waterfield?!

138
00:18:00,221 --> 00:18:01,359
You'll never find her.

139
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,300
Tell me!

140
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:18,980
Mollie, go and fetch the Doctor, quick!

141
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:20,024
Yes, mistress.

142
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:26,743
Hurry! Arthur, stop it. I implore you! Stop it!

143
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:27,772
Leave me!

144
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,592
Please, I implore you. Stop it!

145
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:40,590
Jamie, what have you done?

146
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:45,243
But, I can't understand it. He just... just collapsed.

147
00:18:45,464 --> 00:18:49,056
Arthur, are you all right? What's happened to him?

148
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:51,995
Do you want to save a man's life?

149
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:52,899
What do you...?

150
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:53,745
Do you?

151
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:54,542
Yes!

152
00:18:54,710 --> 00:19:01,574
Then take him away from here, as far away as possible. Go and get the carriage round to the stables. You go too Mollie. We'll bring him after you. Now do go along.

153
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:02,585
But, Doctor.. Oh, Mollie.

154
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:07,631
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

155
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:18,452
Yes, I thought he was under some sort of control. Come along.

156
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:22,745
The creatures!

157
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:24,603
Yes, don't worry about them.

158
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,080
There's danger, I tell you. Some kind of danger.

159
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:29,584
Yes, I know there's danger. You must leave here immediately.

160
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:31,109
The house... the creatures abroad.

161
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:35,853
Now you leave them to us. Take Ruth Maxtible with you. She's waiting for you at the stables.

162
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,692
Yes, very well.

163
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:39,037
Can you manage?

164
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:52,279
Yes, I think so. Wait. There's something in the back of my mind. Victoria Waterfield - I feel I've harmed her in some way.

165
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,362
Victoria is safe and well.

166
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:55,733
You... You're positive?

167
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:58,391
Yes, I'm positive. Now we'll take care of her. You must leave immediately.

168
00:19:59,106 --> 00:20:03,763
Yes, if that's what you want. I'll find Ruth by the stables?

169
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:04,819
Yes!

170
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:10,641
Well, that's fine for Ruth Maxtible, but you lied about Victoria.

171
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:15,256
Yes Jamie, and we must turn that lie into a truth.

172
00:20:48,413 --> 00:21:14,928
Turn around. Pick up the human female. Obey. Obey! Hurry! Hurry! Move into the cabinet. Obey! Move!

173
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:29,674
Well Jamie, the experiment's nearly over. I've had no sleep. I've been up all night, but it's been worth it.

174
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:30,995
Ah, don't touch me!

175
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,445
Now what's the matter?

176
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:35,325
Anyone would think this was a little game.

177
00:21:35,566 --> 00:21:36,530
No. It is not a game.

178
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:43,710
Of course it isn't, Doctor. People have died. The Daleks are all over the place, fit to murder the lot of us, and all you can say is you've had a good night's work.

179
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:44,842
Jamie.

180
00:21:45,157 --> 00:21:52,348
No, Doctor. Look, I'm telling you this: you and me - we're finished. You're just too callous for me. Anything goes by the board - anything at all.

181
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:56,745
That's just not true, Jamie. I've never held that the end justifies the means.

182
00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:01,769
Ach, words. What do I care about words? You don't give that much for a living soul except yourself.

183
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:10,096
I care about life. I care about human beings. Do you think I let you go through that Dalek test lightly?

184
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:17,097
I don't know. Did you? Look, Doctor, just whose side are you on?

185
00:22:20,177 --> 00:22:22,531
It's all right, Jamie. Uh... They're friends.

186
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,254
Friends?

187
00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:26,498
Now don't get the wrong idea. They are the experiment.

188
00:22:48,811 --> 00:23:05,042
Every feeling, every thought impulse you had during your attempt to rescue Victoria Waterfield was recorded and made into a small positronic brain and added to these Daleks. The "Human Factor" to add to their own powers - to triumph over human beings.

189
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,724
Well, how do you know they haven't succeeded?

190
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:18,731
Because human beings, Jamie, no matter how brilliant they may be, are always within reach of other human beings. Now then, it's all right, Jamie. Don't worry.

191
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:21,424
H... How do you know you can trust them, Doctor?

192
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:31,448
What is it? What do you want? Hmm? What are you up to? Ah! What are you doing?

193
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:33,248
Doctor, where are they taking you?

194
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:51,509
Where are you taking me? Jamie! They're taking me for a ride! Jamie, they're playing a game. It's a game! They're taking me for a ride!

195
00:23:53,006 --> 00:23:56,246
A rather amusing little game, don't you think Jamie?
