and that wouldn't do at all, would it?
那样的话你就跟我一样聪明了, 这样可行不通, 是吧？

A battered old police box?
看起来不会。不过不在我们主线上啊, 不是吗, 先生？一座破旧的警用电话亭？

00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:49,698
WATERFIELD: The whims and caprices of our patrons is our line, Mr Perry.
我们的主线就是让客户感到新奇、多变, Perry先生

94

WATERFIELD: Yes, uh... I hope I may be forgiven if I believe
that entitles me to demanding less curiosity of you.
是的, 哦。。。如果我觉得这可以允许我要求你少一点好奇心, 期望你不会觉得我太过分

00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:10,620
PERRY: Sorry, sir.
抱歉, 先生

我想你也同意, 这笔薪水是相当可观的

97
00:06:13,637 --> 00:06:17,885
PERRY: No complaints on that score.
Long as I'm not asked to do anything dicey.
我对此完全满意。只要不让我去做一些太冒险的事情

98
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:19,671
WATERFIELD: "Dicey?"
“冒险？“

99
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,299
PERRY: Crooked. Illegal.
邪恶的, 非法的

100

WATERFIELD: Your candor is refreshing, Mr. Perry,
even if your judgement of character is somewhat questionable.
你还挺直率的, Perry 先生。不过你的他人的判断有点问题

101
00:06:27,862 --> 00:06:28,788
PERRY: I didn't mean that...
我并不是这个意思。。。

102

不过那个。。。那个电话亭。。。我们拿它怎么办？

106
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:47,059
WATERFIELD: Do? We do nothing.
怎么办？什么也不办

107
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:49,225

但我们得做点准备, 对吧。多给你的钱就为了这

HALL: Ah, not me, mate.
啊？我不行, 伙计

现在才说有点太晚了吧, 是不？他们已经在外面了

128

听着, 我是不会卷入一场绑架的, 没得商量

奇怪, 为什么付钱让他帮忙偷走 TARDIS, 又来砸他的头？

到底为什么要偷 TARDIS 呢？

这事儿我也想不清楚, Jamie

—— 也就是穿上工作服晃悠两下
 
148

Why not just go off in the lorry?
你想想, 为什么要晃悠？他显然是被安插下来的。为什么不跟着货车一起跑掉呢？

JAMIE: A what?
什么？

157
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:46,063

JAMIE: Well, what else?
还有什么？

166

DOCTOR: Well, normally people pull out their matches from right to left.
These have been torn out from left to right.
看这个, 一般来说人们都是从右往左抽火柴。但这些是从左到右的

JAMIE: What does that mean?
这说明什么？

168

DOCTOR: It means we've got to find a coffee bar called "The Tricolour"
这说明我们要去一个叫做”三原色“的咖啡馆,

have been there once. There's no guarantee he'll ever go there again.
机会还比较小, Jamie, 或者说非常小。他可能只去过那个地方一次, 不敢说他还会再去那里

but you were quite right. He got onto the name on the matches straight away.
就是, 我跟你说, 进展非常顺利, 我都没想到。不过你是对的, 他直接就注意到了火柴上面的名字

Why leave that man in the hangar to give us a clue?
不, 不, 这事没那么简单。为什么要在机库留一个人给我们留下线索呢？

我们并没有跟着那条线索啊, 记得吗, ”Leatherman"

265

What did you find out?
因为在这方面你比我强多了, Jamie。你发现什么了吗？
