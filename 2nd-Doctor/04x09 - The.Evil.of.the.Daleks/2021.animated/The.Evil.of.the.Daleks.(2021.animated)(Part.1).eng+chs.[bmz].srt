141
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,600
DOCTOR: - put on a pair of overalls and just hang around.
—— 也就是穿上工作服兜两个圈子

142
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,856

Why not just go off in the lorry?

DOCTOR: Yes, this man rolled his own cigarettes

147
00:09:18,064 --> 00:09:21,070
DOCTOR: So these must belong to somebody else.
That's a fair assumption.所以这东西属于其他某个人, 这是比较合理的假设

148
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,220
JAMIE: What's that?
那是什么?

149
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,560
DOCTOR: It's all right. It's only a train.

DOCTOR: There is this...

00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:56,272
- DOCTOR: And that's not all...  - JAMIE: Well, what else?

158
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,896
DOCTOR: Well, normally people pull out their matches from right to left.

DOCTOR: These have been torn out from left to right.

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,336
DOCTOR: It means we've got to find a coffee bar called "The Tricolour"
这说明我们要去找一个叫做”三原色“的咖啡馆

162
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,140
DOCTOR: and look for a man called Ken or Kenneth
- someone who's left-handed.
找寻一个叫做 Ken 或者 Kenneth 的人, 这人还是个左撇子
