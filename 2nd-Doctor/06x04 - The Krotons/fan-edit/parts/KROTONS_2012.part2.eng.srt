1
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:28,521
Oh Doctor don't move!

2
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,149
Aah, it's alright Zoe. I-I think it's quite safe now.

3
00:14:32,398 --> 00:14:33,274
Oh I wouldn't be so sure!

4
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:35,002
Just watch this Jamie.

5
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:45,241
Pattern recognition!

6
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:47,021
Yes, and the pattern is my face!

7
00:14:47,242 --> 00:14:51,906
Doctor, do you mean that thing was sent out
to attack you and only you?

8
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:54,145
Yes, so it seems. It's rather flattering isn't it?

9
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,042
Well then the Krotons know who you are,

10
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:56,859
Aye!

11
00:14:57,008 --> 00:14:58,232
Or at least what you look like.

12
00:14:58,387 --> 00:15:01,434
Yes... That means they must have a scanner
in the wall of the machine./? 

13
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:04,634
Now if we can find that we might be able to get in touch with them.

14
00:15:04,808 --> 00:15:05,186
Uh.. Doctor!

15
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:05,921
Oh no.

16
00:15:36,242 --> 00:15:37,263
It's gone back.

17
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:40,938
Yes. That poor fellow must have confused it's attack mechanism.

18
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:41,677
Eh?

19
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:46,243
Well it was programmed to kill once - me!
It must think that it's succeeded, stupid machine!

20
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:52,826
There's your wonderful Krotons for you Father! MURDERERS!

21
00:15:53,781 --> 00:15:56,396
No! Thara, don't provoke them!

22
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,736
Is that all you care about, not provoking them?!

23
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,941
What can we do against their weapons?

24
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:02,091
We can fight..!

25
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:08,092
THIS IS A WARNING. YOUR LEADER HAS BEEN DESTROYED. /08.2

25
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:14,092
ALL GONDS LEAVE THE LEARNING HALL AT ONCE - AT ONCE.

26
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:16,646
No, stay and fight!

27
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:21,854
LEAVE THE LEARNING HALL. ALL GONDS LEAVE THE LEARNING HALL.

28
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:29,865
Everyone leave the hall. Now!

29
00:16:41,443 --> 00:16:42,535
Where did this come from?

30
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:44,291
I borrowed it from Beta.

31
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:46,901
But I thought they didn't know anything about electricity?

32
00:16:47,142 --> 00:16:52,575
They don't - er, that works on stored solar energy. /52.6

33
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:55,075
Yes the Gonds are quite advanced in some ways. /55.1

34
00:16:55,142 --> 00:17:00,175
The-their medicine is pretty good,
but they haven't got very much general chemistry./17.2

35
00:17:00,242 --> 00:17:01,375
I wish they had an ECT machine though.

36
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:03,379
Yes. There are tremendous gaps in their knowledge./?

37
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:07,379
Well they only seem to know what the machines teach them.

38
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:13,318
Yes. And the machines are programmed by the Krotons,
so the gaps in their knowledge may be significant.

39
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:14,961
Ah, Selris...

40
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,160
How is she Doctor?

41
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:26,094
Well I think she's better, it's difficult to tell. /?
Um Selris, is it safe to enter the Learning-Hall yet?

42
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:27,274
Why?

43
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:31,020
Er, Zoe and I want to have a look round, don't we Zoe?

44
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,185
Oh, do we?

45
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:35,040
Yes, that's right. Ah Jamie, hold out your hand will you?

46
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,021
Well what for?

47
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:37,787
Ah, these pills I got from Beta.

48
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,180
Well there's nothing wrong with me!

49
00:17:39,304 --> 00:17:43,350
No-no. Ah, they're for Vana.
I want you to stay and look after her.

50
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:45,135
Oh but why can't I go with you?

51
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,486
Because I particularly want you to give her those pills the moment she wakes up.

52
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:50,680
Ah well...

53
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,332
Well why are we going back to the Learning-Hall?

54
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:54,293
Oh, to learn Zoe, why else?

55
00:17:54,381 --> 00:17:55,769
I am coming with you Doctor.

56
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:58,229
Oh my dear fellow, there is no need for that.

57
00:17:58,419 --> 00:17:59,951
I must know what is happening.

58
00:18:00,627 --> 00:18:04,771
Oh well.. ah, certainly. Come along Zoe.

59
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:18,283
Er Selris um, what's that?

60
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:20,886
Oh, ah, that leads to the under-hall.

61
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:22,439
Oh, what's down there?

62
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:23,902
Nothing, it's never used.

63
00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:29,818
I wonder how far underneath..?
Ah, let's have a look shall we?

64
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:38,808
Oh, ah... Oh yes, it's-it's a bit dark and musty down here. /?

65
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:42,808
Zoe, stay up there will you? We shan't be long.

66
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:43,787
I told you there was nothing down there.

67
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:48,461
Ah, but there was Selris. Something rather curious.

68
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:52,251
Only the foundations of the machine.
It stands on those metal pillars.

69
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:53,318
Zoe!

70
00:19:59,071 --> 00:19:59,995
Zoe!

71
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,798
Oh, you're soon back Doctor.

72
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:03,799
What do you think you are doing?!

73
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:05,766
I was just trying the machine.

74
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:08,024
You should know better than to do a thing like that!

75
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:13,211
Oh but Doctor, it was all so easy!
The Krotons were very pleased with me.

76
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:14,801
Very pleased?

77
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:20,360
- Well I felt they were.
- Zoe! Now just you listen to me!

78
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:25,961
Whatever else they are, these Krotons are certainly not friendly!

79
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,374
- Now we know that don't we?
- Yes of course!

80
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:31,137
And they use these machines to plant impressions in the mind.

81
00:20:31,224 --> 00:20:33,837
That's how they've enslaved these people all these years.

82
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:34,763
Doctor!

83
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:35,512
What?

84
00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:36,520
Look at the dial!

85
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:37,391
Oh what of it?

86
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:42,295
It's amazing! Even the best of our students
registered less than half of that score!

87
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:48,478
Yes well, Zoe is something of a genius.
Of course it can be very irritating at times!

88
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:50,849
... I went into the machine...

89
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:51,986
Did you see the Krotons?

90
00:20:54,023 --> 00:20:58,796
The ball... Flashing! Coming down on me!

91
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,651
Now you're quite safe here Vana, now!

92
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,496
You'd better take these, here.

93
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,414
Drink up now - all down. That's it.

94
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:17,560
Flashing ball burning her mind?

95
00:21:17,795 --> 00:21:22,194
What did she mean? Is it another of the Krotons weapons?

96
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:27,816
I don't know... Look, you stay here with her,
I'll go and get the Doctor.

97
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:34,976
It's crystalline.

98
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:38,627
Yes, it's hard but it-it's not brittle.
I've never seen anything quite like it.

99
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,264
What was it like down there?

100
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:47,325
Mm? Oh, what Selris calls the foundations.
Uh... Zoe, it was like a root structure.

101
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:50,044
A root structure!? But indicates that...

102
00:21:50,216 --> 00:21:54,184
That this so-called "machine" is organic in structure.

103
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:56,185
Well is that possible?

104
00:21:56,451 --> 00:22:02,660
Well why not? Some crystals do resemble simple virus forms.
I wish I could get a bit of it for analysis...

105
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:07,833
Well if you're right that means
that the whole of this machine is a sort of a living thing!

106
00:22:08,031 --> 00:22:11,185
Well all life doesn't necessarily have feeling you know...

107
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:12,489
Great jumping gobstoppers! What's that?

108
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:14,417
The Krotons command. It means there is a message for me.

109
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:16,006
Oh, what does it say? Mm?

110
00:22:16,563 --> 00:22:21,700
Class three-one-nine-seven, selected female Zo-Gond.

111
00:22:21,865 --> 00:22:24,560
Zo-Gond? Zoe - they mean you!

112
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:27,029
They've chosen you as a companion.

113
00:22:27,282 --> 00:22:29,326
And we all know what happens to them don't we?

114
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:30,806
Oh Doctor what shall I do?

115
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:32,870
Well she doesn't have to go does she?

116
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:36,184
Well does she or doesn't she?!

117
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:40,908
I'm afraid she must.
Complete obedience is the Krotons first command

118
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:43,891
- And if we fail to obey...
- They'll destroy you, I see...

119
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:44,711
Oh dear.

120
00:22:44,853 --> 00:22:47,470
Now d'you see what you've done?! 
Fooling around with this stupid machine!

121
00:22:47,628 --> 00:22:48,504
Oh, but I'm not a Gond!

122
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:49,923
But that machine doesn't know that!

123
00:22:50,398 --> 00:22:51,722
Oh, where are you going?

124
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:54,940
I'm going to take the test,
I can't let you go in there alone! Er... what do I do?

125
00:22:55,114 --> 00:22:58,702
Oh sit down, and put this... This headset on.

126
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:01,105
And press the button.

127
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,690
Press the button!

128
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:06,001
Alright, no need to shout!
Now go away and don't fuss me!

129
00:23:06,144 --> 00:23:07,009
No come back, what's this?

130
00:23:07,165 --> 00:23:08,674
- .. What..
- ...It's alright, I know!

131
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:10,568
Alright, fire away. I'm ready.

132
00:23:23,078 --> 00:23:25,339
Ah. Oh... oh.

133
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,657
Oh Doctor, you've got it all wrong!

134
00:23:28,878 --> 00:23:33,036
Oh dear, I've been working in square roots.
Er, can I have that again please?

135
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:35,188
Well they don't give you a second shots!

136
00:23:35,587 --> 00:23:35,991
Oh.

137
00:23:36,198 --> 00:23:37,141
Well press the button again!

138
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:43,948
This is the most advanced machine.
Perhaps he can't answer the questions?

139
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,734
Of course he can. The Doctor's almost as clever as I am!

140
00:23:47,896 --> 00:23:48,530
I see.

141
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:51,470
Uh... oh now what have I done?

142
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:56,977
Oh Doctor, you've divided instead of multiplying!
You must concentrate!

143
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,419
I am Zoe, I am!

144
00:23:58,667 --> 00:23:59,298
Good.

145
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:11,230
Mm-mm. Yes er, I think that's rather better.

146
00:24:12,295 --> 00:24:14,473
I think I've scored more than you have Zoe!

147
00:24:14,881 --> 00:24:19,343
You answered more questions.
Besides, this isn't supposed to be a competition!

148
00:24:19,848 --> 00:24:23,333
It's clever isn't it?
The way they make you feel that they're pleased with you...

149
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,149
Yes. Perhaps the Krotons aren't as bad as we think?

150
00:24:27,403 --> 00:24:28,072
What..?

151
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:31,521
What? Of-of course they are!

152
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:34,438
Ah, what happens now?

153
00:24:34,784 --> 00:24:36,546
The Krotons will be waiting for Zoe.

154
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,754
Well they can wait! We are going in there together.

155
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:41,083
Normally the names don't come through for some time.

156
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:42,113
Well mine did.

157
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:45,577
Yes, but perhaps they were impressed
with your performance, and that's why.

158
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,786
Sounds a bit like a dinner gong, doesn't it Zoe?

159
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:55,658
Class three-one-nine-eight, selected male - Doctor-Gond.

160
00:24:55,933 --> 00:24:57,240
Doctor-Gond. Idiots!

161
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:01,904
Well it means you anyway.

162
00:25:03,338 --> 00:25:07,045
Yes, er-er... Well, are you ready?

163
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:10,646
I suppose we have to...

164
00:25:13,116 --> 00:25:15,656
Well we started this, we'd better go through with it./?

165
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:18,356
We've got to get to the bottom of this somehow Zoe.

166
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:19,737
Oh this is all my fault!

167
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:23,359
Oh cheer up, cheer up.
I expect it'll be quite interesting really.

168
00:25:24,026 --> 00:25:27,603
I am sorry Doctor. 
My people will always remember you.

169
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:34,777
Eh? Oh... oh that's very nice of them. 
Stay close to me Zoe.

170
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,284
Doctor! No wait, come back!

171
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:40,902
What's happened?

172
00:25:41,658 --> 00:25:42,561
Where've they gone?

173
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,246
Your people are gone. They are now companions of the Krotons.

174
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:49,433
Wha-?

175
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:57,906
It is a spaceship!

176
00:25:58,136 --> 00:26:00,335
Yes, but there doesn't seem to be any crew.

177
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:09,216
Hello... anybody there? Is anybody at home, hello!

178
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:13,731
I think we've been asked to sit down.

179
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,797
Yes I think we have Zoe.

180
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:21,362
Uh, Zoe... Hold onto the end of this chain.

181
00:26:21,534 --> 00:26:22,404
What for?

182
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:29,479
Look up there - it's a force generator.
This chain might help to equalise the power load.

183
00:26:29,681 --> 00:26:31,030
Well what are they going to do?

184
00:26:41,805 --> 00:26:43,459
Doctor I can't move!

185
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:50,905
No, it's a forcefield. Try and relax... relax.

186
00:26:52,832 --> 00:26:54,803
But why did you let them go?

187
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,174
It is a command of the Krotons.

188
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:59,649
Ah, the Krotons! They just rap out an order
and everyone jumps don't they! /?

189
00:26:59,746 --> 00:27:01,549
Aye, well I'm not just standing here to see my...

190
00:27:01,642 --> 00:27:02,368
Where are you going?

191
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:04,092
To find a way into this box of tricks!

192
00:27:04,751 --> 00:27:05,258
Ow!

193
00:27:51,562 --> 00:27:55,131
Are you alright Zoe? Oh!

194
00:27:55,482 --> 00:27:57,265
Yes... I think so...

195
00:27:57,796 --> 00:27:58,599
Oh!

196
00:27:58,859 --> 00:27:59,814
What happened?

197
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:03,308
Oh some tremendous power, oh!

198
00:28:04,211 --> 00:28:10,779
They seem to have a way of transferring
mental power into pure energy.

199
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:17,058
Yes. And they used it -
or-or rather us to operate a thermal switch.

200
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:20,572
Doctor look!

201
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:21,773
Yes.

202
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:23,954
I thought there was a wall here.

203
00:28:24,184 --> 00:28:30,267
Yes, there was. Zoe I think that I'm beginning to understand.

204
00:28:30,535 --> 00:28:31,579
What's that?

205
00:28:34,302 --> 00:28:42,696
That's curious... Zoe, I think we've gone and done it.

206
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:43,548
What?

207
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:48,112
Well... Just a minute I've got an idea.

208
00:28:54,448 --> 00:28:59,830
Oh yes... This is a form of slurry. Crystals in suspension.

209
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:01,211
But what's its purpose?

210
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,397
Well, life is supposed to have begun on your planet in the sea, mm?/?

211
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,097
Primeval soup someone once called it. /?

212
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,997
Well there are lots of sorts of soups aren't there,
I-I wonder what this sort is?

213
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,116
And what do you suppose these are?

214
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:18,207
They look like astronauts' air lines.

215
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:20,350
Yes I think you're right Zoe. Zoe look!

216
00:29:21,485 --> 00:29:27,750
I think it's time we... got out of here.
Come along! Uh..

217
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:41,885
Well what are we going to do if we do get out?
We haven't learned anything yet.

218
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:43,586
Yes we have, once we can analyse this.

219
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,001
Now uh, come on...

220
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:06,786
It should slide somewhere.

221
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:08,980
Yes, there must be a trip-mechanism.

222
00:30:09,231 --> 00:30:11,210
Doctor look, there's a photo-electric cell here.

223
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:12,015
Aah!

224
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:13,209
It can't be working.

225
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:14,712
Well if it's not working...

226
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:16,813
Then the Krotons must have cut the circuit.

227
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:17,718
Yes.

228
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:19,866
Then we're trapped, they know we're here!

229
00:30:20,023 --> 00:30:24,154
Just a moment I have an idea.
Er, that piece of mica that I picked up, here we are...

230
00:30:24,357 --> 00:30:26,759
Now if I can use it to bridge the gap...

231
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:28,310
Well will mica work?

232
00:30:28,517 --> 00:30:29,892
Well the whole machine's made of crystal.

233
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:36,762
Wait! The poison jet!

234
00:30:36,886 --> 00:30:40,099
THEY HAVE ACTIVATED THE CIRCUIT.

235
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:44,350
THEN THE DISPERSION UNIT WILL KILL THEM.
