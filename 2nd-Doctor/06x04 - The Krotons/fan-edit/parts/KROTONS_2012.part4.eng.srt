1
00:34:33,145 --> 00:34:34,280
I'm going down. You go back.

2
00:34:35,235 --> 00:34:36,511
Well be careful Thara!

3
00:34:37,263 --> 00:34:38,997
Doctor!

4
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:41,069
Are you alright Zoe?

5
00:34:41,256 --> 00:34:42,040
Yes, I think so.

6
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,210
Come on, this way.

7
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:44,673
No, we must find the Doctor!

8
00:34:44,785 --> 00:34:45,512
Well where is he?

9
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,210
S-somewhere over there, I saw him fall.

10
00:34:47,371 --> 00:34:49,213
I'll look for him. You stay under here.

11
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:52,401
Vana, what are you doing here? Why aren't you in the hills?

12
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,341
Because Thara and I stayed behind with Beta to make some acid./?

13
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:57,341
We were bringing it here for the Doctor
when we felt the earthquake.

14
00:34:57,493 --> 00:34:58,158
The Doctor!

15
00:34:58,623 --> 00:34:59,521
Has anyone seen him?

16
00:34:59,737 --> 00:35:01,661
He's probably buried down there with the digging party.

17
00:35:02,326 --> 00:35:04,608
I've found him Zoe!

18
00:35:06,763 --> 00:35:07,523
Oh...

19
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:09,915
Are alright Doctor?

20
00:35:10,131 --> 00:35:13,773
Yes, yes, I think so. I don't think there's any bones broken.

21
00:35:14,165 --> 00:35:16,504
But if they don't get that vibration under control soon..!

22
00:35:16,674 --> 00:35:17,607
We must hurry, there's gonna be a...

23
00:35:17,788 --> 00:35:19,073
- Oh look out!
- Look out!

25
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:26,796
Oh!

26
00:35:28,217 --> 00:35:33,407
Oh, Thara! Ah, don't worry, we'll get it off you. Zoe!

27
00:35:33,669 --> 00:35:34,760
Oh Doctor.

28
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:43,581
CUT AUXILIARIES.

29
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,153
AUXILIARIES CUT.

30
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:46,441
OUTPUT ZERO.

31
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:49,094
FEED IN EMERGENCY POWER.

32
00:35:50,456 --> 00:35:52,770
GRAVITATION FEED CHECK.

33
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,766
STATIC.

34
00:35:56,436 --> 00:36:01,452
DYNOTROPE BALANCE NORMAL.

35
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:08,795
Could be a fracture.

36
00:36:09,343 --> 00:36:10,596
Feels painful enough.

37
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:12,873
I'll strap it. Oh Doctor, give me the wood.

38
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:16,021
Yes w.. hurry up Zoe!
We've got to move out of here you know.

39
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:17,288
You think there'll be another earthquake?

40
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:18,530
Oh that was not an earthquake.

41
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:19,953
Oh no, it was coming from the machine.

42
00:36:20,757 --> 00:36:22,305
- It's stopped.
- Yes.

43
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:26,451
That means the Krotons are free to deal with us.
Haven't you finished yet Zoe?

44
00:36:26,612 --> 00:36:28,447
No I haven't. Hey, can I borrow your braces?

45
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:29,104
No!

46
00:36:29,248 --> 00:36:29,870
Ooh!

47
00:36:30,203 --> 00:36:31,424
Here, I'd much rather you use this.

48
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:32,219
Oh...

49
00:36:32,669 --> 00:36:35,312
Yes Doctor, I'm afraid we have failed.
The machine is unharmed.

50
00:36:35,466 --> 00:36:38,220
I'm not so sure - look at that.

51
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,455
What is happening to it?

52
00:36:43,963 --> 00:36:47,440
I-I'd say it was no longer functioning under full power.

53
00:36:47,963 --> 00:36:53,040
Vana, how is Beta getting on with the acid I asked him to make?

54
00:36:53,408 --> 00:36:54,799
- Oh, he sent this Doctor.
- Oh good.

55
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:56,361
He only made a small amount to start with.

56
00:36:56,446 --> 00:36:58,195
- Yeah... Uh-huh.
- Is it alright.

57
00:36:58,586 --> 00:36:59,731
Pooh, sulphuric acid isn't it?

58
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:01,828
Yes, well basically... with a few things added.

59
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,379
Uh-uh, don't touch - it'll burn you.

60
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,685
Doctor what about Jamie?

61
00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:07,582
Jamie! I'd forgotten all about him in the excitement!

62
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:08,650
Has anybody seen him?

63
00:37:08,798 --> 00:37:09,746
But he followed you.

64
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:13,020
Followed us? What, in there?

65
00:37:13,246 --> 00:37:14,075
Yes, I tried to...

66
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:15,247
Well how long ago?!

67
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:17,158
About an hour after you and the Doctor.

68
00:37:17,497 --> 00:37:21,017
But Doctor, Jamie wouldn't be any use to them!
His mind is completely untrained.

69
00:37:21,177 --> 00:37:24,696
Yes, and if the machine rejects him like the others... Come on!

70
00:37:25,016 --> 00:37:25,622
Doctor!

71
00:37:31,453 --> 00:37:33,065
A-argh... aah... ah Doctor!

72
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:34,005
- Jamie!
- Quick!

73
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:35,382
Jamie, watch out for the poison jets!

74
00:37:35,543 --> 00:37:36,370
It's just on my back!

75
00:37:37,247 --> 00:37:38,221
We've got to get you out of here!

76
00:37:38,316 --> 00:37:39,600
- I know!
- Jamie!

77
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:40,823
It's just another inch I think.

78
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:41,840
I think you're getting free.

79
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:44,081
Oh quick!

80
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,728
What's been happening? I though that machine
was going to shake itself to pieces!

81
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,607
There's no time to explain Jamie. How are you feeling?

82
00:37:54,832 --> 00:37:55,445
- Well I...
- Good.

83
00:37:56,828 --> 00:37:58,525
- There's something I want you to do for me.
- Oh not again!

84
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,493
Now Beta is making some special sulphuric acid for us,
I want you to go and tell him to make it in bulk.

85
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,809
- Yes, but...
- As much as you can.

86
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,599
- Oh, b-b-but Doctor...
- There's no time to argue, now hurry.

87
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:08,132
We'll see you back at the learning hall.

88
00:38:08,364 --> 00:38:09,568
Eh... ah.

89
00:38:10,306 --> 00:38:12,810
BALANCE ZERO PLUS TWELVE.

90
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:17,054
WE HAVE RESERVE POWER FOR TWENTY-SEVEN MORE MINUTES.

91
00:38:17,248 --> 00:38:23,264
THEN WE SHALL EXHAUST! OUR FUNCTION WILL END.

92
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,929
Oh, what do we do next?

93
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:32,243
Well if only we can get inside that machine again, Zoe.

94
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:34,428
You can Doctor.

95
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,263
Oh?

96
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,385
We'll help you into it.

97
00:38:36,573 --> 00:38:37,770
Oh, that's very good of you...

98
00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:38,995
What?! What's all this?

99
00:38:39,206 --> 00:38:39,898
Oh... oh Doctor!

100
00:38:40,108 --> 00:38:44,041
THE HIGH-BRAINS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED! BALANCE CHECK?

101
00:38:44,207 --> 00:38:45,460
ZERO PLUS NINE.

102
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,398
EXHAUST TIME TWENTY-TWO MINUTES.

103
00:38:48,544 --> 00:38:50,458
SHALL I OPEN THE DYNOTROPE?

104
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:53,319
ONLY THE TWO HIGH-BRAINS MUST ENTER.

105
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:55,175
Well take them up!

106
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:58,753
Oh really! We will not be bullied! Don't push!

107
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:01,753
Vana, Vana have you got that bottle, it's vital!

108
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,228
THE HIGH-BRAINS WILL ENTER IMMEDIATELY!

109
00:39:05,617 --> 00:39:07,203
I think we'd better do as they say Doctor.

110
00:39:07,422 --> 00:39:09,029
Yes... V-Vana... oh!

111
00:39:13,988 --> 00:39:20,971
THE HIGH-BRAINS ARE ENTERING THE DYNOTROPE.
PREPARE FOR TAKE-OFF. PHASE ONE.

112
00:39:21,162 --> 00:39:27,385
PHASE ONE READY. SHALL I DESTROY THE GONDS NOW?
THEY ARE OF NO VALUE.

113
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:33,788
NO, THE DISPERSION UNITS USE POWER.
WE HAVE NO POWER TO WASTE.

114
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:35,933
That bottle Selris?

115
00:39:36,129 --> 00:39:37,319
It's alright, I have it here.

116
00:39:37,523 --> 00:39:39,172
The Doctor needs it, he says it's vital!

117
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,224
Come back!

118
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,132
I believe you wish to speak with us.

119
00:39:59,827 --> 00:40:00,656
- Doctor!
- Look out!

120
00:40:03,891 --> 00:40:04,798
No!

121
00:40:11,966 --> 00:40:15,211
SET THE INTERGALACTIC LINK.

122
00:40:16,904 --> 00:40:19,445
TAKE OFF PHASE TWO.

123
00:40:19,952 --> 00:40:22,126
PREPARE TO TRANSFER.

124
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,162
ALL SYSTEMS SET.

125
00:40:24,705 --> 00:40:26,932
YOU WILL ASSIST US NOW.

126
00:40:27,298 --> 00:40:29,297
Assist you? In what way?

127
00:40:29,536 --> 00:40:33,088
THE DYNOTROPE WILL EXHAUST IN TWELVE MINUTES.

128
00:40:33,485 --> 00:40:34,609
Well that's your problem.

129
00:40:34,614 --> 00:40:38,865
Er, no Zoe. If this machine does run down
there will be the most colossal release of energy.

130
00:40:39,114 --> 00:40:41,865
Enough to destroy us, the Krotons and most of the planet.

131
00:40:42,046 --> 00:40:47,312
Er... If you want us to help you, you must explain
what it is you want us to do. What is this thing?

132
00:40:47,462 --> 00:40:54,777
IT TRANSFERS THE DYNOTROPE BACK TO OUR OWN COSMOS.
IT OPERATES THROUGH MENTAL POWER.

133
00:40:55,248 --> 00:40:57,881
You've discovered a way of using mental power?

134
00:40:58,111 --> 00:40:59,507
And you Krotons haven't enough.

135
00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:04,533
FOUR HIGH-BRAINS ARE NEEDED IN RELAY.
THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF US.

136
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:05,846
Then how did you get here?

137
00:41:06,032 --> 00:41:07,862
NO MORE QUESTIONS!

138
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:12,529
If you want us... if you want us to cooperate
you must expect questions!

139
00:41:12,716 --> 00:41:16,075
UNLESS YOU DO AS WE ORDER YOU WILL BE DISPERSED!

140
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,068
Very well, but that won't help you, will it?

141
00:41:19,247 --> 00:41:25,330
WE'RE WASTING TIME! THE DYNOTROPE WAS PART OF A BATTLE FLEET,

141
00:41:25,447 --> 00:41:29,330
TWO OF OUR CREW WERE EXHAUSTED BY ENEMY FIRE.

142
00:41:29,868 --> 00:41:31,083
Do you mean that they were killed?

143
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:39,953
CEASED TO FUNCTION. WE CARRIED OUT THE EMERGENCY PROCEDURE
AND LANDED ON THE NEAREST PLANET.

144
00:41:40,301 --> 00:41:45,153
TO CONSERVE POWER WE SET THE DYNOTROPE IN PERPETUAL STABILITY.

145
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:53,665
Ooh I see! And you set the-the machines systems
to educate the Gonds up to the standard you require.

146
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,426
YES. THEY WERE PRIMITIVES.

147
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:58,684
Well you didn't have to kill them to do that!

148
00:41:58,897 --> 00:42:02,942
GOND SAMPLES WERE BROUGHT IN FOR TESTING AT INTERVALS.

149
00:42:03,997 --> 00:42:10,942
THE DYNOTROPE ABSORBED THEIR MENTAL POWER INTO IT'S CIRCUITS
- THE WASTE MATTER WAS REJECTED.

150
00:42:11,205 --> 00:42:15,948
AND DISPERSED. NINE MINUTES TO EXHAUST TIME, COMMANDER!

151
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:18,931
Look out!

152
00:42:19,113 --> 00:42:20,006
Hey now, careful. Hey watch it!

153
00:42:20,156 --> 00:42:20,849
Watch it, it's deadly.

154
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:21,778
Cue back davit.

155
00:42:21,935 --> 00:42:23,095
Ad admonito.

156
00:42:24,887 --> 00:42:26,596
Where do you think you're going? What's that?

157
00:42:26,884 --> 00:42:30,487
It's something called acid.
The Doctor asked me to make it for him.

158
00:42:30,793 --> 00:42:33,173
He won't be needing that now.
You've been wasting your time.

159
00:42:33,422 --> 00:42:34,441
W-where is he then?

160
00:42:34,617 --> 00:42:35,699
He's joined the Krotons.

161
00:42:36,015 --> 00:42:38,125
You mean he's gone into the machine?

162
00:42:38,313 --> 00:42:39,274
Well what about Zoe?

163
00:42:39,387 --> 00:42:42,604
Zoe too. The Krotons wanted them,
and Eelek surrendered them.

164
00:42:42,757 --> 00:42:44,310
You did what?

165
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,977
The Krotons need your friends
to enable them to leave our world.

166
00:42:48,504 --> 00:42:50,275
And you just handed them over, did you?

167
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:54,186
If the Krotons will leave our world,
they're welcome to your friends.

168
00:42:54,354 --> 00:42:54,995
Ya miserable...

169
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:55,931
Careful Jamie!

170
00:42:58,289 --> 00:42:59,489
It's time we were leaving.

171
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:00,501
Leaving?

172
00:43:02,778 --> 00:43:06,179
- Unless you want to die.
- What are you talking about Eelek?

173
00:43:06,407 --> 00:43:07,914
Beta, for a scientist you're very stupid.

174
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:12,413
The learning hall and most of our city
is built around that Kroton's machine,

175
00:43:12,645 --> 00:43:15,905
- and once that machine starts moving off...
- The whole place will come down.

176
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,980
Exactly, and you'll be buried alive.

177
00:43:18,592 --> 00:43:23,287
Aye, well I'm staying. Somehow I'm gonna
get the Doctor and Zoe out of there. Beta?

178
00:43:24,256 --> 00:43:26,561
Yes, I'll stay here and help you.

179
00:43:27,026 --> 00:43:27,696
Vana?

180
00:43:28,032 --> 00:43:32,800
I'll stay here and look after Thara.
I'm not sensible enough to run away and leave my friends.

181
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:38,784
No. Let them stay, and let them die.

182
00:43:41,668 --> 00:43:43,018
He could be right you know.

183
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:47,883
Aye, maybe so. But I'm not going down without a fight.
Now where do we put this stuff?

184
00:43:48,147 --> 00:43:49,812
PUT ON THE HEADSETS.

185
00:43:49,981 --> 00:43:54,858
Now just a moment. If we're going to help you
transfer the Dynotrope back to your own planet,

186
00:43:55,057 --> 00:43:59,145
- what's going to happen to us?
- YOU WILL SUFFER NO HARM.

181
00:43:59,446 --> 00:44:04,983
Well how can we be sure of that?
We die without oxygen you see.

187
00:44:05,046 --> 00:44:10,183
Er, just as you would die if anyone was to
upset the stuff you're drawing from that tank.

188
00:44:11,564 --> 00:44:13,998
TAKE UP YOUR POSITIONS.

189
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,929
I was merely trying to say that
if anyone was to contaminate what was in that tank,

190
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,329
you'd know what it was like to breathe poisoned air!

191
00:44:20,516 --> 00:44:21,769
SIX MINUTES.

192
00:44:23,414 --> 00:44:27,798
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. PUT ON THE HEADSET.

193
00:44:28,122 --> 00:44:32,295
Oh well, I suppose we had better just take your word for it then.

194
00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:34,894
SET THE TRANSFER LINK.

195
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,595
FINAL PHASE ON AUTOMATIC.

196
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:41,185
Oh. Now then ah, where do you want us to stand?

197
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,552
UNIMPORTANT.

198
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,826
Oh. Well I'll stand over here then.

199
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,529
Oh... Oh Doctor I wanted to stand over there.

200
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:51,222
Oh my dear, oh well you stand there and I'll stand here.

201
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:55,722
Better still, a much better idea.
I'll stand here and you stand...

202
00:44:55,923 --> 00:44:59,555
PUT ON THE HEADSETS OR YOU WILL BE DISPERSED!

203
00:44:59,721 --> 00:45:02,765
Alright, alright. How do, how do you wear these things?

204
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:04,558
Nothing seems to be happening.

205
00:45:04,748 --> 00:45:06,060
Alright, give it time, give it time.

206
00:45:06,274 --> 00:45:08,001
Oh, ha-ha! Butterfingers!

207
00:45:08,195 --> 00:45:09,402
Oh Doctor you are clumsy!

208
00:45:09,597 --> 00:45:13,067
ENOUGH OF THIS! PUT ON THE HEADSETS!

209
00:45:13,265 --> 00:45:15,269
Well it's your fault, you're making me nervous!

210
00:45:30,753 --> 00:45:31,374
Down Zoe!

211
00:45:39,844 --> 00:45:41,871
Yeah. Look Doctor, it's dissolving.

212
00:45:42,128 --> 00:45:45,674
Yeah... yeah. It's returning to it's basic form.

213
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:50,071
Oh Doctor! These fumes, they're choking!

214
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:53,286
Yes, we must get out of here. Zoe, look!

215
00:45:53,551 --> 00:46:01,160
The machine, it's melting! Come on,
let's get out of here before we're trapped.

216
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:22,108
Doctor, Zoe!

217
00:46:22,294 --> 00:46:22,985
What happened?

218
00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:24,175
Did you get out alright?

219
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:24,794
Yes.

220
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,499
How are you?

221
00:46:25,624 --> 00:46:31,301
Yeah.. yes, well I'm a little bit shaken; 
but ah, not half so bad as the Krotons I can assure you. 
What're you doing here?

222
00:46:34,528 --> 00:46:35,789
Look at the machine!

223
00:46:36,267 --> 00:46:39,854
It's working Thara! Look, it's working.

224
00:46:43,289 --> 00:46:45,160
Well what made you think of pouring acid on it?

225
00:46:45,308 --> 00:46:49,514
Well we reckoned that if the Doctor thought
it worthwhile experimenting with a few drops,

226
00:46:49,675 --> 00:46:52,512
- we'd see what a few gallons would do.
- Oh Well done!

227
00:46:52,691 --> 00:46:54,892
But how did you know that the machine would dissolve?

228
00:46:55,728 --> 00:47:02,730
Mm? Oh, well the machine was eighty percent tellurium, Zoe.
And tellurium is soluble in sulphuric acid.

229
00:47:02,899 --> 00:47:05,156
But the machine wasn't pure tellurium.

230
00:47:05,402 --> 00:47:09,378
Well the acid wasn't pure sulphuric acid,
but it worked didn't it?

231
00:47:09,502 --> 00:47:12,878
Come on, let's get away. I don't like goodbyes.

232
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:19,304
It's finished now, isn't it?

233
00:47:19,602 --> 00:47:26,212
Yes it is finished - the end of the Krotons.
We're free at last!
