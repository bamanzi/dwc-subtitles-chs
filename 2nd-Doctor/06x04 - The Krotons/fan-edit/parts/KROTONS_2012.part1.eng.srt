1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:05,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:16,163
Class three-one-nine-six in the first grade.

3
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:24,163
The names of the first selected candidates are:
Male... Abu-Gond!

4
00:00:26,682 --> 00:00:31,427
The second name is female... Vana-Gond!

5
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:33,747
No!

6
00:00:34,972 --> 00:00:42,192
Abu-Gond and Vana-Gond,
you are now the companions of the Krotons!

7
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:43,699
Please Thara!

8
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,251
You can't go, I won't let you go!

9
00:00:45,418 --> 00:00:46,132
I must!

10
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:48,237
Look Vana, we can run away - there's still time!

11
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,298
You know that's not possible, we must always obey.

12
00:00:50,454 --> 00:00:51,304
Why?!

13
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:54,615
Because my son, it is the law of the Krotons!

14
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:08,327
Lovely, lovely, lovely.

15
00:01:10,012 --> 00:01:12,165
Pwoar, bad eggs. Let's try somewhere else...

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,572
No wait a minute... Where are we?

17
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:15,835
Och, you don't expect him to know do you?

18
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:17,535
Well let's explore shall we?

19
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:18,848
An umbrella?

20
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,594
Yes, twin suns. It's bound to be hot.

21
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:21,801
Oh.

22
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:24,478
I don't think I like it here, looks dead.

23
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:25,709
Aye, it smells dead.

24
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:28,993
Sulphur isn't it? It could be poisonous.

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,316
No-no-no-no, the instruments in the TARDIS
would have told us. No it's a...

26
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:35,779
It's a mixture of ozone and sulphur - very bracing!

27
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:54,894
What's that?

28
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,828
Oh yes, fascinating structures. Magnesium silicate.

29
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,479
He means mica.

30
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:02,545
Oh, er, what..?

31
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:03,971
Dead is it?!

32
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:08,551
- A city!
- Yes, fascinating architecture.

33
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,538
It's more typical of a... of a low gravity planet,
yet the gravity here seems fairly normal, yes.

34
00:02:14,748 --> 00:02:15,408
Inca perhaps?

35
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:16,472
Yes Zoe, possibly.

36
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:17,328
Hey, Doctor!

37
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:20,264
Come on, let's see what he's up to. Careful.

38
00:02:24,382 --> 00:02:25,305
Doctor, down here!

39
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:42,812
Well what is it?

40
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,876
Don't know... there's a ramp here.

41
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:49,076
Yes and there's a door as well. Is it a wall?

42
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,406
I hardly think so Zoe.

43
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:56,631
Phwoar, that smell's a lot stronger round here.

44
00:02:58,085 --> 00:02:59,748
Oh this is interesting!

45
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:00,767
What Doctor?

46
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:02,163
Oh, metal isn't it?

47
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:03,957
What, metal covered in moss and lichen?

48
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:04,854
Well, er...

49
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:12,284
Metal? Would you say so? I...
I think we'd better get away from here.

50
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:12,927
What?

51
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,644
Come along.

52
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:14,464
But why?

53
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:17,272
Well this isn't a building, this is a machine.
Come along...

54
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:17,967
Machine?

55
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:18,735
Doctor, it's opening!

56
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:19,989
Come on, quickly - Behind the rocks!

57
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:31,261
What's the matter with him?

58
00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:31,979
Ssh!

59
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:34,618
Oh that poor man!

60
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:36,266
What happened to him Doctor?

61
00:04:36,503 --> 00:04:40,196
I don't know Jamie. Come on, let's...
let's get away from here.

62
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:45,031
Can't you give the order she doesn't have to go,
you're our leader!

63
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,214
But the Krotons have chosen Vana, it is a great honour!

64
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,364
Honour?! WHY do we TAKE their orders?!

65
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:53,344
Vana.

66
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,332
We don't even know if they exist!

67
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:01,588
Thara, you can't say things like that!

68
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:03,673
Get out of the way.

69
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:05,466
She's not going into that machine!

70
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:09,912
She has to go in. No-one defies the Krotons.

71
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:11,708
Alright!

72
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:13,357
Now don't be so stupid!

73
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:14,400
Thara!

74
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:15,898
- We are friends!
- Disarm him!

75
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,545
- It's all right. Don't be afraid.
- Keep back!

76
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:24,011
Do something about him, he's your son!

77
00:05:24,274 --> 00:05:26,593
I'm warning you, one step nearer...

78
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,408
Thara, will you be reasonable?
The Krotons have sent for Vana.

79
00:05:30,517 --> 00:05:31,380
She'd not going!

80
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,315
There's no time for explanations!Â 
As I say, one of your people has been...

81
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:36,768
They're not Gonds!
Their clothes, the way they're dressed!

82
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:38,884
Look we are friendly!

83
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:39,956
Look are you gonna let us pass or what?

84
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:40,838
Doctor! Look...

85
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:07,575
What is happening? Who are these people?

86
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:09,526
That was the very question I was going to ask you!

87
00:06:09,677 --> 00:06:11,826
What is happening here? Where has that girl gone?

88
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:13,938
Who are you?

89
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:15,979
That girl, now where has she gone?

90
00:06:16,072 --> 00:06:18,706
The Krotons! They've sent her to join the Krotons!

91
00:06:19,107 --> 00:06:20,504
Well what are the Krotons?

92
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:22,701
The Krotons live in the machine, so we're told!

93
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:26,709
Vana is joining the Krotons, it is a great honour.

94
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:30,994
Honour! She didn't want to go!
Nobody really wants to disappear into that thing.

95
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:33,225
How do you open this door?

96
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:36,066
Why are you asking so many questions?

97
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:41,906
Because a moment ago we saw a young man
dressed in a silver robe just like that girl, we saw him killed!

98
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,227
Abu-Gond!

99
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:45,725
That's ridiculous, how can these people have seen Abu-Gond?

100
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:46,937
He is with the Krotons.

101
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:50,205
Aye, well we saw someone killed anyway.
He came out of that machine and was...

102
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:51,077
Vaporised.

103
00:06:51,304 --> 00:06:51,703
Aye!

104
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:52,729
Right round the other side!

105
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:53,642
Other side?

106
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:56,598
You have been in the wasteland?

107
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:07,561
They're contaminated... you're contaminated!
No-one goes into the wasteland.

108
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:08,792
Why not?

109
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:13,169
Because it's poisoned, and you will die.

110
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:19,645
Well it-it it may have been poisoned once,
but I can assure you it's quite safe now.

111
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:21,769
Doctor, that girl! If she comes out that way...

112
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:22,909
- Oh Jamie you're right!
- Come on!

113
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:23,881
- Oh we must save her!
- I know!

114
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:24,574
Well come on!

115
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:25,498
That's what I'm saying!

116
00:07:25,622 --> 00:07:27,252
- Where are you going?
- To the wasteland!

117
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:30,132
Well you can't, it's against the law of the Krotons!

118
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:30,881
I'm going with them!

119
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:31,951
Thara come back!

120
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,170
If they can go into the wasteland, I can!

121
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:38,352
Thara! You'll die!

122
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:47,006
I wonder how long... I imagine we haven't much time.

123
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:48,056
Well what are you going to do?

124
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:49,604
Now you keep away Zoe, keep right away!

125
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,919
Can I help?

126
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:52,959
- Well Mister...
- Thara.

127
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:54,101
Yes, well you can find a few more stones like this.

128
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:55,740
- What?!
- Well if you want to help!

129
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:05,723
Ah yes, that one.

130
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:11,164
Right! Come down here...

131
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:14,081
Doctor, I think I can hear something!

132
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:16,126
Yes Zoe, so can I.

133
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,793
Vana!

134
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:26,777
Keep down!

135
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:27,888
Oh Doctor quick!

136
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:28,815
Oh Doctor look out!

137
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:29,760
Oh Doctor hurry!

138
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:30,781
Quick!

139
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,541
Oh my dear... What's happened, what have they done to her?

140
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,688
The vandals - look at that!

141
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:46,003
Well that could have been you!

142
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:48,155
My favourite umbrella!

143
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,368
She doesn't know me. She can't speak or anything.

144
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:53,632
Aye, it's something that the Krotons have done to her!

145
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,298
Let me see...

146
00:08:58,648 --> 00:09:01,371
Oh dear... this is almost catatonic.

147
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:03,001
Well isn't there anything you can do?

148
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:04,944
I'm not a Doctor of medicine you know Zoe.

149
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:09,544
However, if there's no damage to the tissue,
uh... Is there anywhere we can take her?

150
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:11,544
My father's house is quite near on the edge of the community.

151
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:16,158
Good. Well let's take her there, give me a hand.
Come on Jamie.

152
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:36,455
How is she?

153
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:39,318
She's asleep at last.

154
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:40,731
Is she going to be alright, though?

155
00:09:40,886 --> 00:09:43,071
Well I hope so Jamie, it's difficult to tell.

156
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:43,971
Oh thank you.

157
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:46,070
And she was one of the finest students we've ever produced.

158
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:48,163
Oh really? Competition for you Zoe.

159
00:09:49,518 --> 00:09:52,997
Selris was just saying that no-one's ever seen these Krotons.

160
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:54,948
Aye, they never leave that machine.

161
00:09:55,134 --> 00:09:57,228
How did all this begin Selris?

162
00:09:57,443 --> 00:10:02,930
According to our legends, silver men came out of the sky /02.9

163
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:06,630
and built a house among us. The Gonds attacked them /06.6


164
00:10:06,743 --> 00:10:10,030
but the silver men caused a poisonous rain to fall /10.1

165
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,430
killing hundreds of our people and turning the earth black.

166
00:10:12,637 --> 00:10:13,420
The wasteland!

167
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:19,787
Yes. Because it was said that ever afterward
anyone who set foot there would die in terrible pain.

168
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,602
But what happened after this war with the Krotons?

169
00:10:23,974 --> 00:10:26,480
Ever since we have lived in peace with them. /?

170
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:28,980
The Krotons never show themselves to us, /?

171
00:10:29,074 --> 00:10:31,680
but we learn from them through the teaching machines.

172
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:32,859
Teaching machines?

173
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:38,457
Yes, in the Hall of Learning, where you were today.
The machines fill the mind with knowledge.

174
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:42,041
And everyone uses these machines?

175
00:10:42,284 --> 00:10:44,493
Well, when they are young; that is the law.

176
00:10:44,716 --> 00:10:46,014
Whose law Selris?

177
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:48,172
Our law - the Gonds'.

178
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,179
But I thought that you said all your laws
were given you by the Krotons?

179
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes, all our science, all our culture...
Everything we have has come from the machine.

180
00:10:57,178 --> 00:11:00,791
I see, a sort of self-perpetuating slavery. /59.9

181
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:06,791
And the Krotons always choose your two most promising students?

182
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:12,106
To be their companions, yes.
Do you think they've all been killed?

183
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,994
Aye well we saw one of them killed anyway.

184
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:17,697
Well why are they doing it Doctor, what's the point?

185
00:11:17,936 --> 00:11:21,614
Well it's time it was stopped anyway, it's high time it was stopped!

186
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,995
What shall I tell my people? How can I explain?

187
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:28,591
Explain what? Just tell the truth!

188
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:30,144
What, that they've been tricked?

189
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:36,144
That for thousands of year the best of our students
have been dying, murdered by the Krotons?!

190
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:37,606
Well what are you afraid of?

191
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:40,778
Another war between your people and the Krotons you mean.

192
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:44,213
Yes... There could be terrible bloodshed - another wasteland

193
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,348
- Selris...
- Ah Beta, come and meet our guests.

194
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:50,699
Th.. my friends, this is Beta our controller of Science
and my son's good friend...

195
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:52,953
That's what I'm here for -
do you know what Thara's planning?

196
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:53,662
Planning?

197
00:11:53,872 --> 00:11:55,851
He and some students from school have gone down to the Learning Hall. /?

198
00:11:55,972 --> 00:11:56,951
They're going to wreck the machines!

199
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,762
- No!
- You've got to stop them Selris.

200
00:11:58,922 --> 00:12:01,893
I came as quickly as I could, but they'll be there by now.

201
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:03,000
Then it's too late!

202
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:04,488
Not if we cut through the wasteland.

203
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,838
Aye, it's the shortest route.

204
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:06,868
Wasteland?

205
00:12:06,982 --> 00:12:07,954
But the poison!

206
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:10,153
Oh that wore off a long time ago, it's quite safe now.

207
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:12,095
Oh well look, we've been in it twice today and we're alright!

208
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,606
Very well!

209
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:23,636
There! That should fetch them out!

210
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:24,868
Come on, let's wreck another!

211
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:25,589
Smash..!

212
00:12:25,731 --> 00:12:35,941
STOP! THIS IS A WARNING - LEAVE THE HALL.
ALL GONDS LEAVE THE HALL NOW.

213
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:37,376
It's the Krotons!

214
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:42,785
LEAVE THE HALL. ALL GONDS LEAVE THE HALL NOW.

215
00:12:43,003 --> 00:12:45,055
That's just a voice, listen!

216
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:46,974
THIS IS A WARNING.

217
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:50,028
Come out you Krotons and fight!
Come ouut!

218
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,054
Murderers!

219
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,396
No, no, stop it!

220
00:12:52,594 --> 00:12:54,292
Leave it alone! What are you doing?!

221
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:59,875
Stop it, stop it all of you!
Listen to me, this will do no good at all! /59.9

222
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:03,775
These Krotons must have enormous Scientific powers,
you can't defeat them with axes!

223
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,037
Now if this was an atomic-laser, it might be more use!

224
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,867
An atomic-laser? Is that better than an axe?

225
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:32,663
Look at the damage you've done - completely senseless!

226
00:13:32,952 --> 00:13:34,334
Look what they did to our friends Father!

227
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:37,398
Destroying the machines won't avenge Abu... or help Vana, will it?

228
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:39,870
But we can't get in there! If we attack their machines...

229
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:41,642
The Krotons will come out!

230
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:45,867
I think something's coming out now!

231
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:53,926
Doctor, what is it?

232
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:57,888
I don't know Zoe, but keep well clear of it!
