1
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:05,548
So, these creatures have a life system based on tellurium, eh?

2
00:31:50,698 --> 00:31:10,448
It's fascinating isn't it Zoe?
Then that tank must have been a polarised centrifuge.

3
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:13,351
- Which we activated.
- Oh don't blame yourself Zoe.

4
00:31:13,484 --> 00:31:19,968
Oh, that machine must have lain around
for thousands of years for someone as clever as us to turn up.

5
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:24,533
Just like a giant mousetrap -
and those poor Gond students have been the mice.

6
00:31:24,764 --> 00:31:30,872
Yes, that's horrible. Still, you must admit,
that it's a-a very good way of existing through time.

7
00:31:35,273 --> 00:31:36,589
Are you sure you're strong enough?

8
00:31:36,735 --> 00:31:37,932
Of course. I'm alright now.

9
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,480
I can carry you.

10
00:31:40,617 --> 00:31:42,791
That won't be necessary, I'll walk Thara.

11
00:31:42,928 --> 00:31:44,049
It's a long way to the hills...

12
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,034
Doctor you're back!

13
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:46,678
Yes, I'm sorry I've been so long.

14
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:48,051
But... we thought you were dead!

15
00:31:48,183 --> 00:31:48,888
Dead?

16
00:31:49,003 --> 00:31:50,364
Selris said that you'd gone into the machine.

17
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:55,318
Oh yes, well we did, but er... Well-well er,
what goes in must come out, mustn't it?

18
00:31:55,448 --> 00:31:57,511
- You're better aren't you?
- Much.

19
00:31:57,648 --> 00:31:58,977
Sit down, you mustn't...

20
00:31:59,103 --> 00:32:00,484
Oh, I'm glad to see you're going on holiday.

21
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:02,045
Holiday? We aren't goi...

22
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:03,197
Well it looks as though...

23
00:32:03,346 --> 00:32:04,663
Well the city's being evacuated.

24
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:06,127
Evacuated? What do you mean?

25
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:08,080
My father's going to lead an attack on the Krotons.

26
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,280
He hopes they'll strike back and come out into the open.

27
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:11,994
Didn't he learn last night?

28
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,017
Oh he's going to attack the machine from underneath.

29
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,592
Demolish the machine's supports.

30
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:19,044
Oh I don't think that's a very good idea!
Zoe, there's no time to be lost!

31
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:20,625
Will you take me to Beta please?

32
00:32:20,793 --> 00:32:21,463
Yeah.

33
00:32:32,845 --> 00:32:36,049
Thara, if you've come to try and persuade me
to leave you're wasting your time.

34
00:32:36,226 --> 00:32:38,442
I haven't, the Doctor asked to see your laboratory.

35
00:32:38,602 --> 00:32:39,558
Can you hold my bag please.

36
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:41,411
Er, there's a small job I want you to do.

37
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:42,298
Oh, what's that?

38
00:32:42,451 --> 00:32:46,897
It's sulphur. I've written out some instructions here,
I don't know whether you can follow them, can you?

39
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:51,360
Yes, I think so. But the Krotons forbid us to study chemistry.

40
00:32:51,514 --> 00:32:55,461
Yes... Beta, did it ever occur to you to wonder why?

41
00:32:55,614 --> 00:32:56,657
Doctor, where's Jamie?

42
00:32:56,868 --> 00:33:00,149
He's supposed to be looking after you.
Well where's he got to?

43
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:02,230
Well he followed you out to the Learning Hall.

44
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:03,654
Well I haven't seen him since this morning!

45
00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:05,838
Oh you don't suppose he tried to get into the machine do you?

46
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:06,893
Come on, we must go!

47
00:33:07,013 --> 00:33:07,608
Yes, let's!

48
00:33:07,713 --> 00:33:10,167
Give me a sample of that as soon as you can will you?

49
00:33:12,511 --> 00:33:15,115
Vana, I'm staying here to help.

50
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,230
Oh no you're not, you're going to the hills the pair of you.

51
00:33:18,365 --> 00:33:21,497
Oh don't be ridiculous Beta we're not leaving you here.

52
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:25,497
Besides, I feel quite faint - I don't think I could walk a step.

53
00:33:26,435 --> 00:33:28,918
THE GRAVITATION FEED IS DROPPING.

54
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:34,283
THE DYNOTROPE IS MOVING OUT OF BALANCE.
STATIC BEAM, SWITCH TO FULL VOLUME.

55
00:33:34,497 --> 00:33:35,715
FULL VOLUME ON.

56
00:33:35,856 --> 00:33:37,272
SYSTEM CHECK COMMENCE.

57
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:53,115
If that comes down we shall all be killed!

58
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:56,808
But the machine will come down first!
Look at the vibration!

59
00:34:00,046 --> 00:34:01,932
Stop it! Stop it!

60
00:34:02,025 --> 00:34:04,577
What do you think you're doing, you idiots?!

61
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,077
Just unhook the thing,
you're meddling with things you don't understand!

62
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,357
Oh Doctor, look out!
