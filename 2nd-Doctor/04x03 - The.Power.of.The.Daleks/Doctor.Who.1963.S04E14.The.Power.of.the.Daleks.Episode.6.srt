00:00:07,505 --> 00:00:08,505
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:29,847 --> 00:00:33,252
Orders received. Exterminate all humans!

3
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:36,016
Exterminate all humans!

4
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:42,233
Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy!

5
00:00:42,646 --> 00:01:07,407
Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy!

6
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:13,112
Take up positions. Ready to exterminate all human beings.

7
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:14,785
Exterminate!

8
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:20,804
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!

9
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:27,724
Move on!

10
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:28,658
The Dalek!

11
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:29,632
What about it?

12
00:01:29,815 --> 00:01:30,748
Can't you see it's armed?

13
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:32,042
Keep moving!

14
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:36,464
This area is restricted.

15
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:37,722
On whose authority?

16
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:38,772
Silence!

17
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,272
Repeat. This area is restricted.

18
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,623
Obey or you shall be exterminated.

19
00:01:48,883 --> 00:01:50,122
I thought they obeyed us?

20
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:51,702
What do we do now, Doctor?

21
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:54,269
This way.

22
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:07,229
They will be exterminated.

23
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:11,393
We've won. The revolution's over. I'll pass the word to Valmar, Kebble and the rest.

24
00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:15,032
Wait. The revolution is not quite over yet.

25
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,879
What more can we do? Hensell's dead, you're the new Governor. The battle's over.

26
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:27,618
Not quite. You mentioned Kebble, Valmar and that rabble. Well now they must be dealt with.

27
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:29,451
But those are our own men.

28
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,644
Huh, huh. Of course.

29
00:02:31,877 --> 00:02:33,070
I don't understand.

30
00:02:33,665 --> 00:02:50,706
Do you think I can ever be secure in that chair while that rabble are still loose? They rebelled against Hensell yesterday. Tomorrow it'll be my turn. Well, let them rebel. Tell them the guards have taken control. Let them attack, and then we can crush them, utterly!

31
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,488
You say "we".

32
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:59,274
Yes. We've come a long way together you and I. You going to back down now?

33
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,528
Couldn't you just arrest them?

34
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:05,127
Everyone must be killed.

35
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:08,841
Must they all be slaughtered?

36
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:09,987
All of them.

37
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:16,053
Well, are you still with me?

38
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:18,848
I suppose so.

39
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:24,925
Then do as I say. I'm glad you agreed with me.

40
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:38,827
Now!

41
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,534
What have you brought me in here for?

42
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:46,508
Quiet!

43
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,413
Whose side are you on anyway?

44
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:52,922
I thought I was going to be on the winning side.

45
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:54,025
What changed your mind?

46
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:58,982
Bragen. The colony's become too small for him. He wants us out of the way now.

47
00:03:59,176 --> 00:04:01,945
Yeah, well it often happens that way, mate, when you follow blokes like him.

48
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:06,292
Look, I'm going to try and get your friends here, if I can. So wait here.

49
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:20,754
Station One reporting, Governor Bragen.

50
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,521
Yes.

51
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,689
The rebels are gathering. We've got them under observation.

52
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:29,561
Don't let them concentrate in large groups. Hit them before they organise. They'll be making their move any time now.

53
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:30,322
Right.

54
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:55,929
People of Vulcan. This is your new Governor talking to you. I have to announce that Governor Hensell has been murdered by the rebels. I have taken control temporarily, until order is restored. People living on the perimeter and in the interior can stay calm. We know who the murderers are.

55
00:04:56,267 --> 00:05:02,981
I shall keep you informed of events as soon as I am able, so listen for the signal to watch your communication sets. That is all.

56
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:06,164
Ah! There you are.

57
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:06,861
Ben!

58
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,812
I knew you'd be all right!

59
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:08,783
Polly - you okay?

60
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:09,528
Oh, yes.

61
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:10,690
Did Valmar find you, then?

62
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:11,491
Valmar? No.

63
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:13,121
What's this about Valmar?

64
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:16,509
Well it seems Bragen's gone power-mad. He wants the rebels to revolt, then he can finish them off.

65
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:20,564
The Daleks won't care who they fight. They'll exterminate every human being on this planet.

66
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:23,548
Doctor, please let's go back to the TARDIS.

67
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,369
Quinn. Keep them both here.

68
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:26,788
Well, wait a minute, Doctor!

69
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:28,981
All right. All right.

70
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:31,214
Now what do you think he's up to?

71
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:36,198
Orders received. Daleks commence extermination.

72
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,520
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!

73
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,867
Just a minute, Examiner.

74
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:53,380
All right. Hold it!

75
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:55,873
Down everyone!

76
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:20,458
Don't come any nearer.

77
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:21,727
What do you mean?

78
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:28,280
I overheard your conversation with Bragen. But you can't stand up to the Daleks, so your plan will come to nothing.

79
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:29,965
Not my plan - Bragen's.

80
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:30,980
But that's the same thing.

81
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:31,783
Not any more.

82
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:33,976
You expect me to believe that?

83
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:46,318
Look Val, he was going to kill me too. I came here to do exactly what you've done. Let Bragen see what the Daleks are like. He doesn't know how strong they are.

84
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:47,995
He's got to be stopped.

85
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:53,367
You will lead us to the middle of your party of human beings.

86
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,162
Yes.

87
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,984
We will fight for you.

88
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:01,156
Believe me, Val, it's the only way to save all our lives.

89
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,869
Did you know that the Daleks are duplicating?

90
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:04,808
Yes.

91
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:07,513
But we are your friends.

92
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:09,931
We will serve you.

93
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:13,382
Take us to the centre of your group.

94
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:14,842
Can we trust them?

95
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:21,178
We must! The guards have orders to wipe us out. We must use the Daleks. Come on.

96
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:32,747
Doctor!

97
00:07:33,024 --> 00:07:33,910
The window. Does it open?

98
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:34,626
I dunno.

99
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:37,079
It had better, or we're done for! Out you go.

100
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:40,089
Ah!... Ah!... What's happening?

101
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:44,395
The Daleks. They're teeming all over the corridors. We've got to get back to Lesterson's lab.

102
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:11,405
This is Governor Bragen speaking. A group of rebels is attempting to take over the colony. It is the duty of all loyal citizens to help the guards resist. Stay in your homes. Order will be restored. Listen to my bulletins.

103
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:16,667
The rebels are using the Daleks against our people!

104
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:21,004
Well, get back and fight! Why do you come running to me? What do you think your guns are for?

105
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:22,262
Well, the guns don't work against them!

106
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:23,368
Get back and fight them!

107
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:51,462
There, and there!

108
00:08:56,446 --> 00:08:57,340
Over there!

109
00:08:57,977 --> 00:09:00,258
No! No! Over there! They're our people!

110
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:01,164
Cut the Dalek gun off!

111
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:05,311
No! Ah!...

112
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:07,251
I told you to cut the gun off!

113
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:07,972
I did!

114
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:09,582
You've killed our own people!

115
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,883
We have to dismantle the gun, that's all.

116
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:14,580
Oh, look at it.

117
00:09:16,631 --> 00:09:19,649
Your usefulness is over.

118
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:27,310
Come on!

119
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:32,170
Quick, Val. Come on!

120
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:36,905
Doctor, it's stupid to hide in here!

121
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:39,098
Well, do you fancy your chances outside in the corridor? No thanks.

122
00:09:39,318 --> 00:09:40,438
The answer must be here somewhere.

123
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,827
Ssssh!

124
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:42,766
Ah!...

125
00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:02,669
You must be absolutely quiet. They know everything that's going on. Everything! They even know what you're thinking.

126
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:04,849
Where do they get their power from, Lesterson?

127
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:13,243
Ah, I tried to turn the power off. But they were miles ahead of me. Marvellous creatures. You have to admire them.

128
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:14,966
But we've got to stop them!

129
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:28,709
Oh, it's too late for that. They're the new species, you see. Taking over from homo sapiens. Man's had his day. Finished now.

130
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:41,039
The static circuit is nearly complete.

131
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:45,608
Soon we can abandon the power we are using.

132
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:53,852
The humans are being exterminated.

133
00:11:03,573 --> 00:11:05,773
Did you hear that? They're going to use their own power!

134
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:10,683
The cables they laid. The trick I tried before won't work anymore.

135
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:20,878
Oh, eh, if that's no good now, we're finished. All we can do is marvel at the creatures who are taking our place.

136
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:25,928
No!

137
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:26,823
Come on!

138
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:28,007
Don't be a fool - come on!

139
00:11:42,904 --> 00:11:43,839
Take it easy, Polly.

140
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:47,791
Can't we do anything?! They're murdering everybody, one by one!

141
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:50,620
You've done all this. Why did you give them power in the first place?

142
00:11:51,031 --> 00:12:05,813
Well, I could control it, you see. And then Janley got one of her men - Valmar, I think it was, yes - and he rigged up a secret cable. It's carrying power directly from the colony's supply.

143
00:12:06,513 --> 00:12:09,802
Where? Where is it, Lesterson?

144
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:18,649
Valmar's the only one who can answer that. Or the Daleks of course. They know everything. Yes, you should ask the Daleks.

145
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:21,771
Then we must find Valmar.

146
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:24,052
No! You stay here and look after Polly.

147
00:12:24,263 --> 00:12:25,161
I'll go.

148
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,206
You'll have to leave her now, Valmar.

149
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:17,490
She wasn't as bad as you think.

150
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:22,107
Valmar! Where is the Dalek power.

151
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:23,713
Get down, both of you!

152
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:45,501
Valmar! Where is the Dalek power supply?

153
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:48,348
We've got to stop them, Valmar. She's dead! There's nothing you can do for her!

154
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:51,954
The main cable's inside the capsule. But there's nothing you can do.

155
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:54,024
There must be some way of cutting off the power.

156
00:13:54,184 --> 00:14:04,660
What makes you think I want to do that? We need more time. I know. A diversion. Bragen's guards. We'll have to use them to keep the Daleks busy. You go to Bragen.

157
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:23,780
Section One? Where's your report? Are you there Section One? Section Two? Section Two? Why don't they answer? Can you hear me Section Two? Section Three? Oh, why don't they answer? I'm their Governor. Why don't they answer?

158
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:23,654
This is Bragen speaking. I'm speaking to the Daleks. Daleks, listen to me. I am the Governor. You must work for me. Do not trust the rebels. I will give you whatever you want. But immobilise your guns. This is the Governor speaking.

159
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:26,718
He's nuts, trying to talk to the Daleks.

160
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:42,069
Lesterson, what's in that cupboard?

161
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:44,159
Nothing. It's quite empty.

162
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:45,925
Well, come on, Polly, we'll be safe in there, love.

163
00:15:57,685 --> 00:16:00,404
Do you hear me, Daleks?! You will obey my orders!

164
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:04,177
No use, Bragen. The Daleks have stopped obeying your orders.

165
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:05,546
Ah! Guards!

166
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:11,013
Dead! The Daleks have killed them. You still have your guard units in the interior. How long will it take them to get here?

167
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:12,015
That depends.

168
00:16:12,175 --> 00:16:13,374
Well, get them!

169
00:16:13,544 --> 00:16:14,896
Well, they will be intercepted by the Daleks.

170
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:18,372
Exactly! It will draw them away from here and give the Doctor a chance to deal with them.

171
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,701
I refuse to allow my guards to be sacrificed.

172
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:25,356
In that case the Daleks will destroy everything on this colony.

173
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:38,178
Guards. This is Bragen speaking. All units will report immediately to the capital. Be prepared to face the rebel Daleks.

174
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,149
There. Are you satisfied?

175
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,544
I hope it works.

176
00:16:53,021 --> 00:16:54,786
Ben! Polly!

177
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:56,658
Doctor, did you hear what Bragen said?

178
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:57,622
Yes, I did.

179
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,473
Well I only hope the Daleks do go for the guards.

180
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,587
A lot of the Daleks went out just now.

181
00:17:01,892 --> 00:17:03,752
Good, because we're going inside. Come on Valmar. _.

182
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:14,403
Ben, give us that spare cable over there. Polly, keep watch at the door.

183
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,505
Well, you know what you're doing?

184
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:18,415
Of course I do!

185
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:20,998
Well, why can't you just take all the plugs out and cut the power off?

186
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:22,923
Because I prefer to do it my way!

187
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:24,544
Look out!

188
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:37,518
Static power is being stored. We can dismantle the human electric system.

189
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:40,969
The law of the Daleks is in force.

190
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:43,407
Extermination of humans.

191
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:48,907
Our cables have been moved.

192
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:52,574
And I could tell you who did it!

193
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:55,087
What were you doing in there?

194
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:57,755
I want to help you.

195
00:17:57,987 --> 00:17:59,078
Why?

196
00:18:00,922 --> 00:18:04,348
I am your servant.

197
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,652
We do not need humans now.

198
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:12,930
Ah, then, but you wouldn't kill me. I gave you life.

199
00:18:13,164 --> 00:18:15,844
Yes, you gave us life.

200
00:18:48,108 --> 00:18:59,843
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!...

201
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:03,347
There are two...

202
00:19:03,662 --> 00:19:10,788
Exterminate! Ah!... Ah!... Exterminate!

203
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,080
What happened to it?

204
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:58,140
I don't know.

205
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:01,084
It seems that your friend, the Examiner, was successful after all.

206
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:06,985
Now I shall restore law and order on this planet.

207
00:20:07,158 --> 00:20:09,071
Not your law, Bragen. That's finished for good.

208
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:10,064
You'll obey me, or...

209
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:13,212
Your day is over, Bragen. No one will obey you now.

210
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,165
I'm still the Governor, and you will...

211
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:17,849
Valmar.

212
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:24,989
He was a murderer.

213
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:27,427
Enough of guns.

214
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:34,360
There's a lot of clearing up to be done. We will rebuild together. What is the extent of the damage?

215
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:37,611
Oh, I don't know if its repairable. The whole electrical system.

216
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:44,411
Are you all right?

217
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:46,024
Oh, he's OK. The clot knocked himself out.

218
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:48,190
It's a miracle. How did you do it?

219
00:20:48,387 --> 00:20:51,415
Eh? What happened? What did I do? What did I do?

220
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:53,385
You destroyed the Daleks, that's what you did!

221
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:54,957
No need to be modest about it.

222
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,090
Did I do that?

223
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,124
You know you did!

224
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:05,220
You used the power from the colony's electric supply - overfed it - and blew up their temporary static circuit. Well didn't you?

225
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:07,521
Did I do all that?

226
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:12,402
You may have stopped the Daleks, but have you any idea of the damage you've done to the colony?

227
00:21:13,113 --> 00:21:14,487
Oh. There was a blow back, was there?

228
00:21:14,683 --> 00:21:19,926
A blow back? Our power supply has been destroyed! It'll be months before we can get things back to normal.

229
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,781
Valmar!

230
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:21,758
That is unfortunate.

231
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,606
But did it have to be this way?

232
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:25,176
I did a lot of damage, did I?

233
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:26,434
Come on.

234
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:35,719
I think we'd better get out of here before they send us the bill.

235
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:49,278
Well, I mean I didn't expect the brass bands to be playing, but I wouldn't have thought a 'thank you' would have hurt anybody.

236
00:21:49,787 --> 00:21:52,843
But Ben, think of all those poor people - all killed.

237
00:21:53,204 --> 00:21:56,589
I know, but the Doctor saved the colony from being completely wiped out.

238
00:21:57,014 --> 00:21:57,708
Hmmm.

239
00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:00,483
Yeah, and he was telling them all along, but would they listen?

240
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:06,606
Mind you, he wasn't very convincing when he was trying to explain it to Valmar and Quinn and everybody.

241
00:22:06,823 --> 00:22:08,179
No he wasn't, was he?

242
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:11,804
Doctor? You did know what you were doing, didn't you?

243
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:31,050
Oh, you needn't worry about them anymore, Doctor. Just a heap of old iron now.
