00:31:36,005 --> 00:31:37,005
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:17,098
I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant.

3
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:21,318
So Lesterson, they're even capable of speech!

4
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,670
Yes. But then, why not? After all, they have a certain intelligence.

5
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:27,735
Yes I know, but...

6
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,541
But is... is it... it is... an intelligence that we can control.

7
00:32:31,932 --> 00:32:34,922
So what you want is permission to continue your experiments?

8
00:32:35,157 --> 00:32:39,900
Governor, think what it would mean if we were to set it to work in the mines. It could double our production overnight!

9
00:32:40,112 --> 00:32:42,095
Consider the effects it could have on our whole economy.

10
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:49,457
Yes, and the effect of that on Earth... Yes. Yes, they could be very grateful.

11
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:53,278
I shall stop you. I will!

12
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:55,905
All right Lesterson, permission granted.

13
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,255
Permission? Permission for what?

14
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,261
To continue my work, Examiner.

15
00:33:01,908 --> 00:33:05,803
But... But didn't you all hear what I said? The Daleks must be destroyed!

16
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,095
Ho, ho. Never!

17
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:12,597
Very well. If not by my order - then by Earth's! Come Ben, Polly.

18
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:15,483
You're my servant, are you?

19
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,886
I... I am.

20
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:33,070
Very well. Immobilise yourself. Go on. I order it! Immediately!

21
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:38,620
Huh!

22
00:33:42,428 --> 00:33:43,527
Lesterson.

23
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,326
Why did you stop obeying? You were given an order.

24
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:50,550
He has gone.

25
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:52,398
Then you obey only...

26
00:33:52,597 --> 00:34:06,856
His order was wrong. I cannot serve human beings if I am immobilised. You gave me power. Your orders are right. I serve you.

27
00:34:06,982 --> 00:34:11,309
Lesterson. Lesterson, it reasons. Just how limited is its intelligence?

28
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:22,494
Now, there is no cause for... for concern, Governor. Just you wait until you see the amount of work it can do! And now, I'm really going to put you through your paces. Follow me, Dalek.

29
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:24,755
I obey.

30
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:36,658
Excellent. excellent.

31
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,767
But I thought we were after the Daleks, not this control unit you've nicked!

32
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,878
Ah, yes!

33
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:48,127
He's a right little delinquent, isn't he?

34
00:34:48,412 --> 00:34:50,657
Doctor, what on Earth are you up to?

35
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:52,423
Ooh!

36
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:55,926
Ah! Now we're really getting somewhere!

37
00:34:57,773 --> 00:35:01,109
Now, the Examiner was attacked, there can be no question of that.

38
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,916
And the button grabbed by the Examiner was missing from your suit.

39
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:06,598
Yes, if you've got anything to add to that, you'd better say it now.

40
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:11,091
I didn't attack the man. I had no reason to. I was the one that sent for him!

41
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:13,921
You sent for him?!

42
00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:19,216
It was necessary. Under the circumstances, I'd hardly be likely to sabotage the radio communications.

43
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,740
But... but why Quinn? Why?

44
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:23,225
Because of the rebels!

45
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:25,952
The rebels! They're nothing more than one or two fanatics.

46
00:35:26,185 --> 00:35:27,156
You know as well as I do that they...

47
00:35:27,414 --> 00:35:31,372
Unless you're trying to create trouble here - to undermine the Governor's position.

48
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:34,966
Bragen, you'd better explain that.

49
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:42,380
If you're removed, who takes your place? The Deputy Governor, of course. And that's the real reason behind all this trouble, isn't it Quinn?

50
00:35:42,655 --> 00:35:43,226
Go on.

51
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:49,013
You attack the Examiner in the mercury swamp and blame it on the rebels. Then you sabotage the radio - blame that on the rebels too.

52
00:35:50,142 --> 00:35:51,552
Get him out of my sight!

53
00:35:51,877 --> 00:35:54,664
Hensell, before you listen to these preposterous allegations...

54
00:36:01,138 --> 00:36:08,167
I chose Quinn myself. I trained him for the job. Why, in a few years time, he'd have had this seat!

55
00:36:08,495 --> 00:36:11,527
Sometimes Governor, a few years is a long time to wait.

56
00:36:15,678 --> 00:36:16,597
Oh, Bragen?

57
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,731
Governor?

58
00:36:19,169 --> 00:36:25,373
You will assume Quinn's duties. As of now, you are Deputy Governor.

59
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,381
Look Doctor, I don't want to appear dim, but how's this going to do the Daleks in?

60
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:39,397
They think that Lesterson's the driving force, but I don't. The Daleks are using him.

61
00:36:39,757 --> 00:36:40,631
But how?

62
00:36:40,872 --> 00:36:49,913
Problem. Smash the Daleks, and the people here will lock us up or kill us. Let the Daleks go, and we'll all be exterminated.

63
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:53,644
We could just go back to the TARDIS. At least we'd be safe to think there.

64
00:36:54,062 --> 00:36:55,589
Oh yes, that's coming on.

65
00:36:55,705 --> 00:36:57,556
Oh, you talk to him, will you?

66
00:36:57,794 --> 00:37:00,704
Doctor look, if you told us what you were up to, perhaps we could help you.

67
00:37:01,183 --> 00:37:11,349
Mustn't underestimate any of them. Lesterson's a first class scientist, first class. He opened the capsule. He realised that the Daleks could be reactivated.

68
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:19,947
Yeah, that could be the answer. Let's kidnap Lesterson, and hide him away for a bit. Well, it would stop him bringing the Daleks back to life, wouldn't it?

69
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:22,461
I thought it was pretty bright.

70
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:23,834
There we are.

71
00:37:24,474 --> 00:37:25,491
What is it?

72
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:33,371
What is it? It could be the answer to all our problems.

73
00:37:34,327 --> 00:37:38,022
Incredible! Well, let's move on to test fourteen.

74
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:40,009
I am ready.

75
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:45,516
When sodium acts on ethyl alcohol, what is the resulting derivative?

76
00:37:46,026 --> 00:37:52,019
Sodium ethoxide. C2 H5 ONa.

77
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:56,866
Just five seconds, Janley! Just the time it took to speak the answer.

78
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,894
Right too.

79
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:07,823
But of course it's right! Look, can you imagine what kind of positronic brain this robot has, Janley? Think of the store of knowledge that it must carry.

80
00:38:07,977 --> 00:38:08,695
May I come in?

81
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:09,883
What do you want?

82
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:12,451
Oh, ah, just to see how you're getting on.

83
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:13,395
If you think...

84
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:18,303
No, please! I'm... I'm not here to cause trouble. I... I'm just interested, that's all.

85
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:21,262
You've done nothing but meddle and interfere ever since you landed on Vulcan.

86
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:27,607
Well, I... I did give you permission to open up the capsule, now didn't I? Please, carry on.

87
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,177
And you won't try to stop me?

88
00:38:30,523 --> 00:38:40,599
Stop you? No, of course not. We get off on the wrong foot, Lesterson, but... but I'm a reasonable man and... and I've been thinking, perhaps I was hasty.

89
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:44,017
Well, if you... if you... if you really want to call a truce.

90
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:47,524
A truce? My dear fellow, I... I'd like to be friends!

91
00:38:48,063 --> 00:38:51,969
Yes. Yes. Very well, you may stay.

92
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:54,861
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

93
00:38:56,102 --> 00:39:00,399
Laboratory. Yes.

94
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,911
All right, I can come now. Right.

95
00:39:11,122 --> 00:39:14,555
I just have to slip out for a few minutes, Lesterson, alright?

96
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:19,101
Ah, yes, yes. Um, very well then. Examiner, shall we test its knowledge of physics?

97
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:22,451
Oh, oh, splendid, splendid. Ah, huh, please, please, carry on.

98
00:39:22,732 --> 00:39:26,551
Thank you. D... what is the First Law of Thermodynamics?

99
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:51,002
When heat is transformed into any other kind of energy or vice versa, the total quantity of energy remains invariable. That is to say, the quantity of heat which disappears is equivalent to the quantity of other kind of energy produced...

100
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,970
Fool! What do you think you're doing?

101
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:55,309
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!...

102
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:57,135
I'm saving your life!

103
00:39:57,955 --> 00:39:59,308
Get out! Get out!

104
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,791
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... I have, ah, sustained no damage.

105
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:14,175
You were able to get away then?

106
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:17,209
Yes. Lesterson's with the Examiner. And Hensell?

107
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:20,291
At a meeting of production managers. He left me in control.

108
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:23,209
We could take over the colony now.

109
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:30,004
No. No it has to be absolutely right. I don't want to take over a colony full of rebels do I, Janley?

110
00:40:30,244 --> 00:40:32,672
Well, I don't know. You're making me help them.

111
00:40:32,983 --> 00:40:43,726
Only to stir them up to create enough trouble to get rid of Hensell, and then... and then we crush them. The whole colony will be grateful, and I'll be Governor.

112
00:40:46,216 --> 00:40:47,614
Is that the gun you told me of?

113
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:50,419
Can you persuade the rebels this will help them?

114
00:40:50,693 --> 00:40:53,620
Yes, Valmar thinks he can work in a switch to turn it on and off.

115
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:55,012
How powerful is it?

116
00:40:55,385 --> 00:41:02,161
It killed Resno, Lesterson's assistant, and Lesterson believes that Resno's simply shaken up - taking a few days off.

117
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:03,347
And the body?

118
00:41:03,835 --> 00:41:16,841
In the mercury swamp. Lesterson was the indirect cause of Resno's death. It's a good hold over him if he makes trouble. I'll give this to Valmar then?

119
00:41:16,805 --> 00:41:17,478
Yes.

120
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:19,020
When do we move?

121
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:23,052
I need another card in my hand. The Examiner bothers me.

122
00:41:23,387 --> 00:41:24,790
I thought Quinn was the danger.

123
00:41:25,072 --> 00:41:31,625
Uh, not any more. The Examiner is no fool. No, there has to be something else.

124
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:37,525
Well?

125
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:40,122
Well, he's not in the laboratory, Lesterson's by himself.

126
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,839
Hmm. He must have gone another way. Can I leave it you? I'm going to go back to the rest room.

127
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,730
Well, but...

128
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,341
Well, somebody's got to clear it up.

129
00:41:46,692 --> 00:41:47,256
Okay.

130
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,685
Hello there.

131
00:41:56,006 --> 00:41:58,650
Hello. Um, you're Lesterson's assistant aren't you?

132
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,056
Yes. You're not looking for the Examiner are you?

133
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:02,843
Well, do you know where he is?

134
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:06,457
Yes, he's waiting to get a message through from Earth. He's in the Communications Room.

135
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,781
Umm...

136
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,456
Oh, you'll find it easy enough. Look. Around, then to your right, in the next block.

137
00:42:12,714 --> 00:42:13,416
Thanks very much.

138
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:25,109
Doctor? Anyone here?

139
00:42:34,398 --> 00:42:40,810
She said she was coming back here. She knew the way, and she wouldn't have wandered off. I know she wouldn't! Oh!

140
00:42:41,747 --> 00:42:46,818
Ben, if you were a Dalek what would be your next move?

141
00:42:47,071 --> 00:42:48,629
I'm talking about Polly.

142
00:42:48,974 --> 00:42:51,583
Oh, no, no, no, no. She's a clever girl, but she couldn't answer this.

143
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:52,956
But she is missing!

144
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:54,283
Oh, no, no, no.

145
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:55,754
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!

146
00:42:56,053 --> 00:43:02,112
No, no, no! She's looking around, there's a lot to see in the colony. She's interested. I like that.

147
00:43:05,439 --> 00:43:05,939
Come on.

148
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,231
Where are we going?

149
00:43:07,463 --> 00:43:09,987
To report it. If we make a fool of ourselves, I don't care! We report it!

150
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:20,510
Yes, yes, yes. I managed to stop that fool of an Examiner just in time. You know there are some people here who believe that you're an enemy.

151
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:23,693
I am your servant.

152
00:43:28,928 --> 00:43:31,771
What does this machine do?

153
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:37,236
You know, it's amazing. You have an almost human interest and curiosity.

154
00:43:37,368 --> 00:43:46,953
A Dalek is bet... is not the same as a human. If I am to help, I must know everything.

155
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,484
Yes. Yes, of course.

156
00:43:48,786 --> 00:43:50,567
What is this machine?

157
00:43:50,874 --> 00:43:54,174
It computes meteorite storms as they approach our weather satellites.

158
00:43:54,522 --> 00:43:56,414
How accurate is it?

159
00:43:56,776 --> 00:44:01,785
About, ah, seventy percent. It helps to cut down on our satellite losses.

160
00:44:01,898 --> 00:44:07,602
Daleks can build pu... computers with one hundred percent accuracy.

161
00:44:07,997 --> 00:44:09,370
One hundred percent?

162
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:16,670
If you provide materials and our own power unit, a computer will be built.

163
00:44:17,122 --> 00:44:21,703
A hundred percent. That would be an enormous saving for the... for the colony!

164
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:24,429
Then, you will get the materials?

165
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:26,280
I'll go and speak to the Governor at once.

166
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:31,747
I will be ready to dictate the blueprint when you return.

167
00:44:32,354 --> 00:44:35,367
Huh, huh. Oh, that's marvellous!

168
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:08,455
You agreed we'd go and see Bragen.

169
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:09,893
Hmm? Power.

170
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,956
Come on then!

171
00:45:12,557 --> 00:45:14,925
Now the energy intake for Daleks should be the cube...

172
00:45:16,536 --> 00:45:17,428
Lesterson!

173
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:18,075
Eh?

174
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:21,454
He just went past. That means we can get into his laboratory again.

175
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:22,518
But we're looking for...

176
00:45:23,085 --> 00:45:24,371
Oh, come along, Ben. Come along.

177
00:45:25,381 --> 00:45:26,622
There's somebody in there.

178
00:45:27,567 --> 00:45:30,150
What are you doing here?

179
00:45:31,399 --> 00:45:35,003
Stand aside. Servants shouldn't question.

180
00:45:35,307 --> 00:45:37,166
Entry is restricted.

181
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:40,645
Not for me it isn't. "Accord every access". I've got a badge.

182
00:45:40,948 --> 00:45:42,156
That is an order.

183
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:45,651
A Dalek order. Short circuit the generator, Ben.

184
00:45:46,028 --> 00:45:51,529
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Stand back!

185
00:45:51,757 --> 00:45:55,675
Don't be frightened of it Ben. It's not armed. I'm going to see what it was doing in there.

186
00:46:05,612 --> 00:46:09,887
Ben, let's get out of here!

187
00:46:10,914 --> 00:46:12,877
Fool. Lesterson must have reactivated them.

188
00:46:13,085 --> 00:46:17,041
Yes. When I say run, Run!

189
00:46:23,253 --> 00:46:29,661
I have sent the human being for materials.

190
00:46:29,903 --> 00:46:31,016
And power?

191
00:46:31,412 --> 00:46:39,109
Yes. Power we can turn into static, then we will conquer.

192
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:47,525
We will conquer... We will conquer... We will conquer...

193
00:46:47,759 --> 00:46:52,750
But if you didn't do it Lesterson, then the Dalek must have used your power supply and reactivated the others itself.

194
00:46:52,965 --> 00:46:54,671
I was going to do that anyway.

195
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:57,186
Are you off your head, mate? Those two are armed!

196
00:46:57,671 --> 00:47:02,056
Then we turn off the electricity, disarm them, and then everything is safe again.

197
00:47:02,328 --> 00:47:03,506
I've already explained to you.

198
00:47:03,741 --> 00:47:11,192
Stop these arguments, both of you. I've had enough. I've every confidence in Lesterson. He has carte blanche for the Daleks from now on.

199
00:47:11,386 --> 00:47:13,083
But they must be destroyed!

200
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:19,816
Bragen, I'm making a tour of the perimeter. I put you in direct charge here. See that Lesterson gets everything he wants, will you?

201
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:25,004
I shall need a permanent guard on my laboratory, Bragen.

202
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:31,787
Don't worry about the Examiner. I think I can keep him quiet.

203
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:40,716
Greed and ambition, that's all it is. Wait till they find out what their precious production figures have cost them!

204
00:47:40,951 --> 00:47:42,145
Oh, I want to see you.

205
00:47:43,281 --> 00:47:44,240
What about?

206
00:47:44,508 --> 00:47:46,507
Well it's Polly, she's missing. We can't find her anywhere.

207
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:50,470
I'll tell one of my men to make enquiries. It shouldn't take long to find her.

208
00:47:50,806 --> 00:47:51,624
Ah, thanks.

209
00:47:52,574 --> 00:48:02,461
Examiner, some of my men have found a body in the mercury swamp. It was the body of a middle-aged man.

210
00:48:03,074 --> 00:48:04,451
What is that to do with me?

211
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:08,177
You're the Examiner - or maybe you're not.

212
00:48:14,443 --> 00:48:16,440
Just exactly what do you mean by that?

213
00:48:17,066 --> 00:48:20,087
Who are you? Quinn's friends? Come to stir up rebellion?

214
00:48:20,873 --> 00:48:24,331
There's only one possible way that you could know I'm not the Examiner.

215
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,526
Yeah, by knowing what the real Examiner looked like!

216
00:48:27,868 --> 00:48:36,394
Exactly, Ben. Exactly! Only two people knew of his arrival on this planet. Myself and his murderer.

217
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:37,724
That's enough!

218
00:48:38,017 --> 00:48:40,304
Is it? Doctor, we've got to tell the Governor.

219
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:46,999
Do you think he'll believe you? I'll soon convince him that you murdered the man yourself. You stole the Examiner's badge.

220
00:48:48,107 --> 00:48:54,577
Then why don't you arrest us? Because there's a doubt isn't there? Because it might, it just might, go against you.

221
00:48:54,867 --> 00:49:02,653
All right, all right, so neither of us wants to make a move. But you leave Lesterson alone - and the Daleks!

222
00:49:09,156 --> 00:49:11,356
He'd make a right Father Christmas, wouldn't he?

223
00:49:11,605 --> 00:49:15,402
Oh, I'd rather fight a hundred of his sort than just one Dalek.

224
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,042
Listen to this. "The girl is safe. She will remain so as long as you leave the Daleks alone".

225
00:49:34,461 --> 00:49:36,585
And did you disarm the other two?

226
00:49:37,136 --> 00:49:43,036
Yes. We are your servants. We do not need guns.

227
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:47,045
I'm very glad. I knew the Examiner was wrong about you.

228
00:49:47,387 --> 00:49:49,435
Did you get our materials?

229
00:49:49,731 --> 00:49:52,251
Yes. Everything you need you can have.

230
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,848
And a power plant?

231
00:49:54,921 --> 00:49:56,007
Everything.

232
00:50:05,384 --> 00:50:08,722
We will get our power.

233
00:50:09,156 --> 00:50:18,423
We will get our power. We will get our power. We will get our power. We will...
