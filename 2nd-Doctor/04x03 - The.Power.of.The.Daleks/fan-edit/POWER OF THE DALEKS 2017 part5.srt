1
01:06:13,042 --> 01:06:13,737
What's the matter? What is it?

2
01:06:15,203 --> 01:06:15,544
Are you ill?

3
01:06:16,151 --> 01:06:21,543
They're in there - making themselves! Duplicating!

4
01:06:21,789 --> 01:06:23,160
What? What are you talking about?

5
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:26,982
I started this, opening the capsule!

6
01:06:27,225 --> 01:06:27,909
Lesterson!

7
01:06:28,127 --> 01:06:29,218
Don't try to stop me!

8
01:06:29,387 --> 01:06:30,265
What happened?

9
01:06:34,182 --> 01:06:44,877
They forget that I control them! I gave them life back again, and now I've taken it away! Finished! Stopped it!

10
01:06:45,387 --> 01:06:46,318
The Daleks...

11
01:06:47,153 --> 01:07:01,114
Evil! Horrible! I know what I'm going to do! Laser torches! Melt them down! I'm going to melt the Daleks down to pools of metal!

12
01:07:01,354 --> 01:07:02,303
You won't Lesterson!

13
01:07:02,534 --> 01:07:12,898
Ah, do you think I care what you can do?! Go on, tell everybody I was responsible for Resno's death! I don't care! I'm going to wipe out the Daleks!

14
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:19,448
Yes, tell everybody all about me! I'm still going to... I'm going to... wipe out the Daleks!

15
01:07:19,699 --> 01:07:28,561
Get me the Examiner. But I've got to talk to him! I've got to, don't you understand?!

16
01:07:35,853 --> 01:07:40,132
How did you get there?! I cut off the power!

17
01:07:40,368 --> 01:07:45,793
We can store power. We will soon have our own.

18
01:07:47,135 --> 01:07:48,147
Own power?!

19
01:07:48,435 --> 01:07:51,288
Why was the capsule door closed?

20
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,105
Own power?! Ahh!

21
01:08:01,726 --> 01:08:05,520
Seal off the capsule's secret entrance.

22
01:08:05,757 --> 01:08:06,872
I obey.

23
01:08:07,612 --> 01:08:08,783
Wait!

24
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:15,388
No more than three Daleks to be seen together at any one time.

25
01:08:15,632 --> 01:08:16,861
I obey.

26
01:08:17,602 --> 01:08:26,003
We are not ready yet to teach these human beings the law of the Daleks.

27
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:36,566
Well, Bragen - these trips are becoming more and more demanding.

28
01:08:36,995 --> 01:08:38,177
I didn't expect you, Governor.

29
01:08:38,424 --> 01:08:42,378
Ah, I had as much as I could stand. Well? What's been happening here?

30
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:43,934
One moment.

31
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:45,571
I asked you a question, man.

32
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:46,916
I heard you.

33
01:08:47,328 --> 01:08:51,983
Look, your work can wait. You can hand over to me tomorrow. I want to hear about the Examiner.

34
01:08:52,784 --> 01:09:00,082
He's an impostor, Governor. Possibly a murderer as well. We have just discovered the body of the real Examiner in the mercury swamp.

35
01:09:01,764 --> 01:09:04,396
I hope you're sure of your facts, Bragen.

36
01:09:04,624 --> 01:09:05,330
Quite sure.

37
01:09:06,181 --> 01:09:09,074
This could have far-reaching consequences.

38
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:13,537
As far as I am concerned, there's nothing more to be said. So if there's nothing further...

39
01:09:13,718 --> 01:09:18,646
Nothing further! Who the devil do you think you're talking to? Stand up when you're speaking to me man!

40
01:09:19,877 --> 01:09:22,145
I prefer to remain seated.

41
01:09:22,417 --> 01:09:26,196
Do you now?! We'll soon see about that. Guards!

42
01:09:27,117 --> 01:09:28,677
Take this man out of my office.

43
01:09:30,055 --> 01:09:32,179
Did you hear what I said? That's an order!

44
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:35,398
You forget, my dear Hensell. They're not your guards - they're mine.

45
01:09:35,556 --> 01:09:36,580
I am the Governor!

46
01:09:36,863 --> 01:09:41,472
No. Not now. I am.

47
01:09:42,002 --> 01:09:48,887
Oh, I see. Your guards, eh? Yes, Quinn warned me about your guards, but we all took them too lightly, didn't we?

48
01:09:49,074 --> 01:09:52,018
When the people hear that I am being kept a prisoner in my own capital...

49
01:09:52,253 --> 01:09:54,786
The people will do exactly as they are told, Hensell.

50
01:09:56,564 --> 01:10:00,543
It will, of course, be easier for them if you co-operate with us.

51
01:10:10,518 --> 01:10:12,777
You're the last man I expected to see here.

52
01:10:13,081 --> 01:10:17,592
Well your imprisonment hasn't been entirely wasted. It's brought your enemy out into...

53
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,798
Bragen? I've known that all along.

54
01:10:19,973 --> 01:10:22,975
Yes. But, ah, did you know that he was the leader of the rebels?

55
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:24,873
Hmm. Work's by sound, does it?

56
01:10:31,386 --> 01:10:34,837
Wait there. Guards, dismissed.

57
01:10:39,596 --> 01:10:43,905
So Bragen, you want my co-operation, do you?

58
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:48,936
It would save bloodshed. I might even let you keep the title of Governor.

59
01:10:49,596 --> 01:10:56,608
Might you now?! I'll tell you what you will do. You'll order your guards to disarm and place yourself under arrest immediately!

60
01:10:57,172 --> 01:11:01,843
So you reject my offer? I thought it a generous one in the circumstances.

61
01:11:02,059 --> 01:11:04,610
What circumstances?

62
01:11:04,836 --> 01:11:05,545
Look at this.

63
01:11:06,797 --> 01:11:07,774
What is it?

64
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:10,322
The reason that the colony is now mine.

65
01:11:14,014 --> 01:11:17,504
Is it a weapon of some kind?

66
01:11:17,721 --> 01:11:22,268
I'll arrange a demonstration for you. Do you still refuse my offer?

67
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:25,254
I will not be intimidated.

68
01:11:25,556 --> 01:11:32,299
Of course not. In character to the last, Hensell. Kill him!

69
01:11:43,251 --> 01:11:48,183
Why do human beings kill human beings?

70
01:11:48,502 --> 01:11:49,438
Get on with your work!

71
01:11:49,551 --> 01:11:52,118
Yes, master. I obey.

72
01:11:52,354 --> 01:12:02,624
Yes, obey me! From now on, I will have complete obedience from everyone!

73
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:13,077
I'll have to check the cable circuit now. Otherwise, it's just as you asked for.

74
01:12:14,245 --> 01:12:15,231
Very well.

75
01:12:15,518 --> 01:12:19,309
Why can't you carry on with the power you're drawing from the colony? Why go to all this trouble?

76
01:12:19,553 --> 01:12:31,916
Until now, we have had to recharge from the colony supply. With static power, the Daleks will be twice as useful.

77
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:32,854
Valmar, quick!

78
01:12:33,188 --> 01:12:33,687
What's the matter?

79
01:12:33,866 --> 01:12:34,397
The Governor's back.

80
01:12:34,626 --> 01:12:35,280
What about the girl?

81
01:12:35,473 --> 01:12:36,045
Leave her.

82
01:12:36,412 --> 01:12:37,264
I will follow you.

83
01:12:37,461 --> 01:12:38,168
What for?

84
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:40,540
I am your servant.

85
01:12:41,302 --> 01:12:41,786
Come on.

86
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:55,326
An electrical circuit of their own supplying static electricity! I wonder how much longer we've got?

87
01:12:56,323 --> 01:12:59,098
I didn't realise they'd have a circuit of their own.

88
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,809
Doctor, look out!

89
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,330
Are you all right?

90
01:13:18,575 --> 01:13:21,279
Well done! Who was the man who went outside just now?

91
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:23,188
Valmar. He's been working for the Daleks.

92
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,447
On their static power supply.

93
01:13:24,598 --> 01:13:25,591
Doctor, they've got Ben.

94
01:13:25,728 --> 01:13:31,287
Yes, I know. He ran away so that I could... Oh well, it's a long story, but don't worry. That boy can take care of himself!

95
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:33,007
Did you hear that? That won't help.

96
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:33,961
Get out! All of you!

97
01:13:34,115 --> 01:13:34,892
What about you?!

98
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:35,807
But Doctor! Oh...

99
01:13:36,085 --> 01:13:36,693
Go!

100
01:13:51,232 --> 01:13:52,800
Have they escaped?

101
01:13:53,015 --> 01:13:56,775
Yes, return to capsule and report.

102
01:13:57,005 --> 01:13:58,446
I obey.

103
01:14:14,018 --> 01:14:20,349
We are to wait here until the human beings fight among themselves.

104
01:14:20,658 --> 01:14:22,734
Then we will strike.

105
01:14:23,015 --> 01:14:42,966
And exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! ...

106
01:14:44,174 --> 01:14:47,533
But why? Why was he killed?

107
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:48,624
I can answer that.

108
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:54,558
He wanted to destroy the Daleks, so one of them killed him. Now, I'm declaring martial law.

109
01:14:54,737 --> 01:14:57,959
Martial law! What good do you think that will do against the Daleks?

110
01:14:58,123 --> 01:15:00,062
The Daleks will do as I tell them.

111
01:15:01,344 --> 01:15:03,159
We shall see, shan't we.

112
01:15:03,471 --> 01:15:04,429
Take them away.

113
01:15:07,626 --> 01:15:11,664
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!

114
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,455
Orders received. Exterminate all humans!

115
01:15:14,627 --> 01:15:16,941
Exterminate all humans!

116
01:15:17,123 --> 01:15:23,212
Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy!

117
01:15:23,475 --> 01:15:48,913
Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! ...
