1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:32,445
His face, his hair - look at it!

3
00:01:32,878 --> 00:01:33,913
He's breathing...

4
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:38,344
...and the TARDIS seems to be normal.

5
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:42,691
Ben, what are we going to do? We can't just leave the Doctor there.

6
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,560
What, him? The Doctor?

7
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:56,768
Ben, do you remember what he said in the tracking room? Something about "This old body of mine is wearing a bit thin. "

8
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,163
So he gets himself a new one?

9
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:00,581
But it's impossible!

10
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:03,916
Not so long ago we'd have been saying that about a lot of things.

11
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:07,186
It's over.

12
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,763
It's over.

13
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:58,097
What are we going to do?

14
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,952
It is the Doctor. I know it is... I think.

15
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:06,242
It's not only his face that's changed - he doesn't even act like him.

16
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,277
Come on, it's time we sorted this out.

17
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,306
Now look here!

18
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:14,359
Hold that.

19
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:15,995
And tilt it.

20
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,717
Have you done with this?

21
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:37,442
Put it down, put it down.

22
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:39,585
Now, what's the game?

23
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:40,479
Ah!

24
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:43,518
The crusades, from Saladin.

25
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:46,594
The Doctor was a great collector, wasn't he!

26
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:48,091
But you're the Doctor!

27
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,565
Oh, I don't look like him.

28
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:52,428
Who are we?

29
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:53,832
Don't you know?

30
00:03:58,442 --> 00:03:59,484
Extermination!

31
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:06,242
Now look, the Doctor always wore this. So if you're him, it should fit now, shouldn't it?

32
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:09,929
There - that settles it.

33
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:13,816
I'd like to see a butterfly fit into a chrysalis case after it's spread its wings.

34
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:15,311
Then you did change!

35
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:17,927
Life depends on change... and renewal.

36
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:23,997
The Doctor kept a diary, didn't he?

37
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:25,162
Yes.

38
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:28,379
I thought so. Now, I wonder where?

39
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:30,354
I wonder where?

40
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:32,868
He's a very different Doctor, Ben.

41
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:35,650
Yeah, maybe. Just where do we stand, though?

42
00:04:56,167 --> 00:05:02,434
Doctor? Doctor, what's going to happen to us?

43
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:11,046
I think... I think we must have landed for sometime. I think it's time we went for a stroll.

44
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:13,782
But you don't know where we've landed!

45
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,067
No, you haven't checked the oxygen or the temperature or anything!

46
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:31,253
Oxygen density one-seven-two, radiation nil, temperature... eighty-six - strong suggestion of mercury deposits. Satisfied, Ben? Now, are you two coming or are you not?

47
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:35,794
He does know us! He said "Ben", didn't you hear him?

48
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:37,463
Yeah, I heard.

49
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:51,082
Are you coming, you two?

50
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:52,136
Hello?

51
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:57,493
Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello?

52
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:02,250
Hello? Why don't they come?

53
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:08,774
Ah, so you've come at last. I'm from Earth. I'm the Examin...

54
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:43,441
"Earth Examiner. Accord every access. Vulcan. "

55
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:53,071
Whoa, they're hot!

56
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:55,298
Hmm, do you think the air's like this everywhere?

57
00:06:55,553 --> 00:07:06,402
Nah - might be just round here. Don't want too many lung full of it, I know that. Here, when I was a kid, we used to live opposite a brewery. You could take a walk and get tipsy all in one go!

58
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,065
It's beautiful!

59
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:09,539
No, don't touch it, Polly!

60
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:11,069
I wasn't going to.

61
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:13,440
No, it's quicksilver - it gets through the pores.

62
00:07:13,798 --> 00:07:18,643
Where is the Doctor, or whatever he is, got to?

63
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:38,985
So the murdered man was the real Examiner?

64
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:41,242
Well, didn't you see who did it?

65
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,177
The Doctor got this button though.

66
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,913
Well, I think it's pretty dull around here. I don't know why we don't just go back to the TARDIS.

67
00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:52,238
Doctor, are you going to let them think you're the real Examiner?

68
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:56,087
Well, won't that be dangerous?

69
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:59,959
Look, why don't you stop blowing that thing and talk to us properly?

70
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:00,648
Ben!

71
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:01,882
Now don't you start - it's bad enough with him!

72
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:02,879
Well, he hasn't done anything.

73
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:09,912
No, that's just the trouble! He knows what happened back at the TARDIS, yet will he tell us? Will he come out and say? Will he admit to being the Doctor?

74
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,327
Come in!

75
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:20,991
I am Hensell - the Governor.

76
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,984
If Earth had seen fit to warn us you were coming...

77
00:08:24,195 --> 00:08:29,371
If Earth didn't warn you we were coming, Governor, they must have had a very good reason. I wonder what it was?

78
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:35,254
Now look here - I run this Colony. I'm entitled to know why you've come to Vulcan. What is your brief?

79
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,502
I am the Examiner.

80
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:38,134
Why are you here?

81
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:43,049
To examine. And I intend to start my examination at once!

82
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:49,250
Someone's leaked reports about these rebel groups - that's it, isn't it?

83
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:52,007
There is Lesterson's capsule.

84
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:55,446
Internal affairs are my business, Bragen. Please don't interfere!

85
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,067
Please go on.

86
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:01,817
The capsule. It was found in a mercury swamp. It must have been here for centuries before...

87
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:06,539
...the Earth colony arrived. I felt it might be dangerous, it might contain bacteria.

88
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:09,606
I shall examine the capsule.

89
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:34,159
Where did you get this?

90
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:36,093
It dropped from the capsule.

91
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,450
Dropped?

92
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:49,660
Yes, when it was being hauled into the laboratory. But, you can see! This metal could revolutionise space travel. That's why I'm insisting that we open it. Well, who knows what other marvels there may be inside?

93
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:52,262
But Lesterson, I didn't think you could open it?

94
00:09:52,779 --> 00:10:00,931
Well, I have a theory. I'm convinced that the opening mechanism on the other side is either here, or here.

95
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:02,880
Extermination...

96
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:08,149
Now, my theory is that I can insert a laser ray in this ridge here.

97
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:13,508
The ray spreads, fuses the opening device and gets us in.

98
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:16,994
Examiner, I shall have to make it your responsibility.

99
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:20,202
A laser? Why not? It shouldn't be too difficult.

100
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,385
Well, we'll try the other side.

101
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,903
Hmm, it's a bit... disappointing.

102
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:53,492
Not really. This is just an entry bay, isn't it?

103
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,808
Yes, I... I suppose so.

104
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:57,660
Well, this doesn't get us very far does it?

105
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:00,851
Ah, getting into the rest of the capsule will take time, Governor.

106
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,208
Well, can't you use that torch thing again? That must be an opening door.

107
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,344
Well, I should have to measure it up and find out where the lock mechanism is.

108
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,112
And I think we'll leave if for tonight.

109
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:08,923
Leave it?

110
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:11,112
Leave it for tonight? But what did we come here for?

111
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:12,730
That is my decision, Governor.

112
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,113
But, good heavens above, man!

113
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:16,203
Two hundred years, you say, this has been buried?

114
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,666
Oh, at least. Now, there must be something in the inner compartment.

115
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,490
We shall be able to find out where it came from originally.

116
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:24,335
It didn't come from this planet - Vulcan.

117
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:27,151
Oh no, no, no. The metal is quite alien.

118
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:33,171
Alien, yes. Very alien. Goodnight.

119
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,780
What's he up to now?

120
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,864
Ben, we're not going to let him out of our sight.

121
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:50,045
Well, Lesterson, you got your way. Was it worth sending for this Examiner? This idiotic Examiner?

122
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:52,088
I didn't send for him. I thought you did.

123
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:55,690
Why don't you let me talk to the Examiner, Hensell? I can find out what's he's here for.

124
00:11:55,863 --> 00:12:02,120
No, no, no, no, you keep away from him. We'll leave him to work with Lesterson here. We've all got enough to do without having to worry about some amateur critic from Earth interfering.

125
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:02,833
But with five minutes, I _...

126
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:11,397
You heard what I said, Quinn. You won't mind keeping the Examiner busy, Lesterson? I don't mind what you do with him so long as you keep his nose... out of our business.

127
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:12,441
Yes. All right.

128
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:14,352
All right. Well, we shall talk about it tomorrow.

129
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:29,041
Ben!

130
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:30,359
What?

131
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:31,809
Shh! He's in the corridor.

132
00:12:31,998 --> 00:12:32,569
Who is?

133
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:34,194
The Doctor, you clod! Come on - quick!

134
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:41,863
He's going towards Lesterson's lab.

135
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,795
Of course - to the space capsule!

136
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:44,801
Come on.

137
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:50,411
Polly, Ben, come in and meet the Daleks.

138
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:51,501
What?

139
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,183
The Daleks.

140
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:13,236
You could have opened this before.

141
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:15,261
These two pieces of metal are identical.

142
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,167
I knew I should find them here.

143
00:14:18,722 --> 00:14:21,262
Ah, they look harmless, not very lively.

144
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:26,879
Two hundred years in a swamp and you wouldn't look very lively either. Nothing could live through that, could it?

145
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,892
Live?

146
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:29,651
Nothing human, no.

147
00:14:30,107 --> 00:14:31,519
Doctor, look!

148
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:34,174
What's the matter?

149
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:40,257
Well, there were three Daleks in here! What's happened to the other one?

150
00:14:43,354 --> 00:14:44,339
Doctor, look!

151
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,612
A light. A torch outside.

152
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:54,833
Did you see it?

153
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:55,936
Quickly Ben, quickly!

154
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:57,054
What was it?

155
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:17,859
Can you answer me?

156
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:21,779
It was a sort of disembodied hand. A sort of claw. It was horrible!

157
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,253
No. No, there's nothing.

158
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:43,260
You were right - there were three Daleks.

159
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:46,363
Do you know what it was?

160
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,848
If there were three, who moved it?

161
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,219
Don't ask me. Lesterson?

162
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:01,584
But he hadn't opened the capsule.

163
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,805
Now he said he hadn't opened it. Lets get our facts straight.

164
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,705
Aha, excellent! Good thinking, good thinking.

165
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:11,701
What, does that mean you think he's been inside?

166
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:14,132
Perhaps he's been experimenting on the Daleks? Ah.

167
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,688
But... but they're things I... I mean they're dead. They must be!

168
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,449
This light is dead. Now the watch!

169
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:24,933
Do you mean these things just need power?

170
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:38,548
Now, Lesterson's fanatic. The Governor's jealous of his own position. What does that suggest to you? Dunno. Hadn't thought about it. That all is not well with this colony. Add to that one Dalek!

171
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:41,164
Oh, blimey, you don't half make mountains, don't you? One Dalek?

172
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:44,633
Yes! All that is needed to wipe out this entire colony.

173
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:54,678
Examiner?

174
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:01,511
Bragen, don't you ever knock before you enter a room?

175
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:06,362
I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I was expecting to find the Examiner here - not you Quinn.

176
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:07,629
Well, he's not here.

177
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:15,013
The Governor gave express instructions that you were not to contact the Examiner - I find you here. I'm sure you can offer some suitable explanation.

178
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:17,165
I can. But not to you.

179
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:20,379
The Examiner is missing. He must be found immediately.

180
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:23,822
Doctor, look, if they're that dangerous, what are you going to do about it?

181
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:36,390
Save my breath. Would Lesterson listen? Uh, uh. Lesterson listen. Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen. Exercises the tongue. Try it! Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

182
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:40,678
Look, they think you're the Examiner, order them to destroy the Daleks! Well, chuck your weight about.

183
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:44,572
Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

184
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:46,327
Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

185
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:47,867
What do you think you're doing in here?

186
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:49,470
Listen, listen...

187
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,904
Who gave you permission?

188
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,346
Read this! Aloud!

189
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:56,379
Accord every access.

190
00:17:56,732 --> 00:18:02,005
Exactly! It doesn't say 'except your laboratory' anywhere does it? Unless it's in micro-print.

191
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:03,775
I should have been asked first!

192
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,221
Where is the third Dalek?

193
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:07,776
I don't know what you're talking about!

194
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:15,454
You opened up the capsule without permission. You found the inner compartment containing three Daleks, you took one of them away and you hid it!

195
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:18,397
Hid it? What... what nonsense!

196
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:20,209
May I ask what all this is about?

197
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:25,613
We opened an inner compartment in the capsule, and Lesterson had already been in there.

198
00:18:25,865 --> 00:18:27,088
I don't deny that.

199
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,333
And he's nicked a Dalek!

200
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:29,371
Dalek?

201
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:33,749
It's the name the Examiner has given to two metal creations that I've discovered inside the capsule.

202
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:35,170
And they're dangerous. Evil.

203
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:37,820
Lumps of metal! Quite inactive.

204
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:40,722
That's what you think, mate. If you'd seen...

205
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:52,767
I consider it's my duty as a scientist to... to examine and investigate these objects. Now please, all of you, keep out of my laboratory. Keep your hands off my experiments!

206
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:58,345
Those 'lumps of metal' - Daleks - I want them broken up, or melted down. Up, or down, I don't care which, but destroyed!

207
00:18:58,518 --> 00:18:59,717
I refuse to allow it.

208
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:05,196
I'm an Earth Examiner - I demand it.

209
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:06,806
You're exceeding your authority.

210
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:10,605
Perhaps we should ask the Governor about that? I wish to see him immediately!

211
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,869
That might be difficult.

212
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,754
But not impossible. Ben, Polly.

213
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:21,403
Could he stop the experiments?

214
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:31,112
I don't know. It's none of your business. You go and get Janley and then come back here. We haven't... haven't got any time to waste. Now go on man, quickly, quickly!

215
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:59,041
I'd advise a little discretion in your investigations. It's not a very good time, just now.

216
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:00,663
With all these disturbances...

217
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:01,630
Disturbances?

218
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:12,935
Yes, minor acts of sabotage, rebel cliques, secret newspapers, nothing important you understand, but it keeps the Governor busy. I have no doubt he'll tell you about it himself when I arrange your meeting with him.

219
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:14,113
When will that be?

220
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:20,251
Ah, he's going on a tour of the perimeter of the colony. I'll... I'll find out if he can see you before he goes.

221
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,621
Thank you.

222
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:38,382
Ah, it's a...

223
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:53,382
He won't stop me experimenting. There must be some way to bring you back to life - and I'm going to find it.

224
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:55,605
Here, I bet old Charlie Bragen did it!

225
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:56,433
Charlie?

226
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:58,048
Well Fred wouldn't suit him would it?

227
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:02,029
If he did do it, do you think it was his own idea? I mean - he could have been under orders.

228
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:05,354
You mean from the Governor? Ah, I don't know. What do you think, Doctor?

229
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:15,601
Oh, yes. Yes of course. Let's... let's consider this button for a moment. It's the only clue we've got to the murderer of the Examiner. The real Examiner.

230
00:21:15,936 --> 00:21:18,401
Hmm. And who asked for him to come?

231
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:21,618
Hmm. Well, Lesterson's crackers about that capsule. He wouldn't want anyone nosing about.

232
00:21:21,874 --> 00:21:24,002
Bragen said the Governor's been having trouble.

233
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:29,344
Naw, rule him out. Governors are all the same, he wouldn't ask for help. If he sent the word it would look as if he couldn't do the job properly.

234
00:21:29,613 --> 00:21:30,354
Yes.

235
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,522
Oh, well, I vote we go back to the TARDIS, I've had enough of this dump.

236
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:38,209
Have you? What about the Daleks?

237
00:21:38,482 --> 00:21:39,572
Well, they're dead.

238
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,796
Well, what about that thing we saw in the capsule - that was alive all right.

239
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:44,880
Well, can't explain that.

240
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:49,695
I can. And that's why we have to stay!

241
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:58,374
Ugly-looking brutes aren't they? Hey, what's he want to muck about with them for? Leave well alone, that's what I say.

242
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:04,307
You're a fine one to be a research assistant. Leave well alone? There'll be no progress on this planet with people like you around.

243
00:22:04,517 --> 00:22:13,942
We're doing all right as we are. Or we were until your lot came along stirring things up. You won't get away with it, you know. The Governor knows all about you rebels. He'll smash the lot of you when he's ready.

244
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:15,098
Governor?

245
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:16,202
Yeah, the Governor!

246
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,071
He couldn't smash...

247
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:37,654
Will you be quiet! Where do you both think you are? This is a scientific laboratory. Kindly keep your politics out of it. Come on, Resno. Man, get on with it. We haven't got all day. We've got to get this working before the Examiner stops us. He's got some phobia about these.. these Daleks?

248
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:41,643
I know the misery they cause - the destruction.

249
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:46,912
Well? Where is the Governor? What did he say?

250
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:52,048
He sends his apologies Examiner. He can't see you tonight, but he hopes to see you first thing in the morning.

251
00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:55,574
Well, it might not wait that long, Char... ah, Bragen.

252
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:56,909
It will have to.

253
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:58,092
Excuse me.

254
00:22:58,192 --> 00:22:58,815
Where are you going?

255
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:00,181
To see the Governor, of course.

256
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:06,498
I'm afraid that's not possible. Once his door is closed, no-one, not even you, Examiner, is allowed into his room!

257
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:11,098
Very well.

258
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:14,163
Thank you. Until the morning then.

259
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:18,346
What happens now?

260
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:24,153
I shall radio Earth. I'll get Earth to back me.

261
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:26,727
Connecting now.

262
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:31,223
All connections responding.

263
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:33,441
Nothing at all?

264
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:34,407
No.

265
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:39,395
It's moving!

266
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:56,772
Now, note this, Janley. Number one attachment with sucker stick responding. Number two attachment not moving. Number three attachment with lens responding. Watch these meters, Resno.

267
00:23:57,025 --> 00:23:57,841
Still responding.

268
00:23:58,114 --> 00:24:03,800
Now, it's reasonable to assume that this the sucker stick acts like some kind of a hand.

269
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:14,197
It's all right - don't be alarmed. We've only introduced temporary power. We shall have to be able to open it up before we could find how it works permanently.

270
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:15,746
It's a bit frightening.

271
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:21,856
Yes. Now, I cannot think what this short stubby arm is for.

272
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:23,821
Could the lens attachment be an eye?

273
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:42,407
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now it's quite possible that this, ah, Dalek... Now there must be some kind of directing influence. There may even be a simplified brain. Positronic, I shouldn't wonder. If only we could open it up!

274
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:45,988
Now what?

275
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,544
Everything functioning here.

276
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:51,935
Yes. Well, perhaps the power is leaking away somewhere. We'll... we'll try again.

277
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,828
Look at the eye-stick!

278
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:19,037
It's watching us!

279
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:20,302
Don't be absurd.

280
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:21,443
It was. I saw it!

281
00:25:21,684 --> 00:25:29,721
You can't use the phrase 'watching us'. You'll have us believing that th... the thing has intelligence next. Now, get on with your work, man!

282
00:26:00,523 --> 00:26:01,209
I know you're there.

283
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,409
Examiner, thank goodness, it's you. I've been trying to talk to you ever since you got here.

284
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:10,108
What's happening here? You again.

285
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:11,350
What do you want?

286
00:26:11,556 --> 00:26:13,322
I found the operator unconscious.

287
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:18,623
So did I! I was just looking at him, when I heard someone move. It must have been you.

288
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:20,338
And those?

289
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:23,922
I picked them up. What is all this?

290
00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:25,635
The cables have been cut.

291
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:31,875
This is serious. It's not just our own communications. We're cut off from Earth as well.

292
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:33,609
The only people who'd want to do that are the rebels.

293
00:26:33,864 --> 00:26:36,596
Those muscle boys of yours had any brains, they'd stop things like this.

294
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:41,681
And you say you picked these up? I suggest that you were sabotaging the communications...

295
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:42,496
That's a lie!

296
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:46,133
...having first attacked one of the engineers. I'd detain the Governor on evidence like that.

297
00:26:46,414 --> 00:26:48,652
I hope you're not thinking of detaining me, Bragen.

298
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:52,490
I've no option. I could hardly let you run around loose after this, could I? 

299
00:26:53,024 --> 00:26:56,781
All right - you win this round, Bragen. We'll see what it looks like in front of the Governor.

300
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,897
All connections responding.

301
00:27:00,193 --> 00:27:00,760
Excellent.

302
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:01,739
It's working!

303
00:27:01,957 --> 00:27:07,947
Excellent. Film it, film it now, Resno. And, note the readings, Janley.

304
00:27:11,592 --> 00:27:13,260
It seems to be interested in you, Resno.

305
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:16,245
What's the matter with you man?

306
00:27:16,895 --> 00:27:21,255
I tell you it's intelligent. It's watching me, Lesterson. Weighing me up! I can sense it!

307
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:22,400
Don't be a fool.

308
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,574
I don't like it I tell you. I don't know what these things can do.

309
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:30,566
No, and we never shall know, shall we, unless we take film of every reaction. Now get on with your work, man!

310
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:41,153
Resno!

311
00:27:47,956 --> 00:27:48,864
It's all right. He isn't dead.

312
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:49,925
What happened?

313
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:51,516
Knocked out by the shock waves.

314
00:27:53,616 --> 00:27:56,378
We must get him to the hospital. I'll go and get help.

315
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:22,189
But we've got to defend Quinn.

316
00:28:22,582 --> 00:28:25,401
Yeah, I know. He's innocent until he's proved guilty. But he is guilty.

317
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:27,006
He's the Deputy Governor!

318
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:33,978
So what? I had a headmaster once who got nicked for not paying his bus fare! And then there's the motive, don't forget the motive.

319
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:35,346
Like what for instance?

320
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:39,165
Well, he's the Deputy Governor, right? Maybe he wants to be Governor.

321
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:40,817
Oh, that's ridiculous!

322
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:47,374
Well, the jacket button wasn't! And he was caught red-handed in the Communications Room with a pair of pliers, and don't tell me he was plucking his eye-brows either.

323
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:51,167
Look, there are some people you know are all right. You just know by looking at them.

324
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,541
Good morning. The enquiry is about to begin. I've been sent to escort you.

325
00:28:57,595 --> 00:29:14,051
I am sorry I couldn't see you earlier, Examiner. Please sit down. Well, Quinn, I don't like this anymore than you do. What have you been up to?

326
00:29:14,443 --> 00:29:16,036
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

327
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:20,220
Well, what about Bragen's report then? These are facts, Quinn. Now, what have you got to say about it?

328
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,417
Does the engineer say I hit him?

329
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:23,967
How could he if he was hit from behind?

330
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:25,333
Then its only circumstantial evidence.

331
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:31,289
The Examiner was also attacked in the mercury swamp. We have a button from your jacket, found in the Examiner's hand.

332
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:33,487
I can't explain that.

333
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,748
I'm sure you can't!

334
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,065
Examiner.

335
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:41,236
You mentioned to Bragen that these machines of Lesterson's... What do you call them?

336
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:43,298
I call them what they are - Daleks.

337
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:48,047
Ah, yes, yes, yes, Daleks. You say they could be a motive for destroying our communications.

338
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,109
I do.

339
00:29:49,473 --> 00:29:51,725
Lesterson, this is a special enquiry. Now please.

340
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:53,739
This won't wait. You won't be disappointed!

341
00:29:53,747 --> 00:29:54,780
You heard what I said Lesterson!

342
00:29:54,812 --> 00:29:59,532
Governor, I've just completed a... an experiment which could revolutionise the whole colony. Bear with me.

343
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,929
Lesterson, what have you done? What have you done?

344
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:05,584
I'll show you. Janley, now!

345
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:44,100
It recognised the Doctor. It recognised him.

346
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:46,342
What's the matter, Doctor? Are you all right?

347
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,882
The fools. The stupid fools.

348
00:30:50,294 --> 00:30:52,902
You're scared! What can it do?

349
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,531
Nothing yet.

350
00:30:54,904 --> 00:30:58,314
It knew who you were! It sounds crazy, but it did.

351
00:30:58,574 --> 00:30:59,415
Knew who I was.

352
00:31:00,745 --> 00:31:02,082
The Dalek knows who you are.

353
00:31:02,543 --> 00:31:08,887
(This creation is called, I understand, a Dalek. Now, look at it. I have merely given it electrical power. But it is capable of storing it.) Moreover, it responds to orders. Turn around.

354
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:17,957
Move that chair.

355
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:38,380
Stop. You see? Well, just think what this could do for our... our mining program, our processing, packaging. Dozens of labour jobs, Governor. It may even supply the end to all this Colony's problems.

356
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:43,250
Yes, it will end the colony's problems, because it will end the colony!

357
00:31:43,714 --> 00:31:48,249
I am your servant.

358
00:31:49,423 --> 00:31:56,144
It... it spoke! Janley, did you hear it? It can actually talk!

359
00:31:56,482 --> 00:32:12,888
It can do many things, Lesterson. But the thing it does most efficiently is exterminate human beings. It destroys them, without mercy, without conscience. It destroys them. Utterly. Completely. It destroys them.

360
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:18,081
I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant.

361
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:17,098
I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant.

362
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:21,318
So Lesterson, they're even capable of speech!

363
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,670
Yes. But then, why not? After all, they have a certain intelligence.

364
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:27,735
Yes I know, but...

365
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,541
But is... is it... it is... an intelligence that we can control.

366
00:32:31,932 --> 00:32:34,922
So what you want is permission to continue your experiments?

367
00:32:35,157 --> 00:32:39,900
Governor, think what it would mean if we were to set it to work in the mines. It could double our production overnight!

368
00:32:40,112 --> 00:32:42,095
Consider the effects it could have on our whole economy.

369
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:49,457
Yes, and the effect of that on Earth... Yes. Yes, they could be very grateful.

370
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:53,278
I shall stop you. I will!

371
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:55,905
All right Lesterson, permission granted.

372
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,255
Permission? Permission for what?

373
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,261
To continue my work, Examiner.

374
00:33:01,908 --> 00:33:05,803
But... But didn't you all hear what I said? The Daleks must be destroyed!

375
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,095
Ho, ho. Never!

376
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:12,597
Very well. If not by my order - then by Earth's! Come Ben, Polly.

377
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:15,483
You're my servant, are you?

378
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,886
I... I am.

379
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:33,070
Very well. Immobilise yourself. Go on. I order it! Immediately!

380
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:38,620
Huh!

381
00:33:42,428 --> 00:33:43,527
Lesterson.

382
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,326
Why did you stop obeying? You were given an order.

383
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:50,550
He has gone.

384
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:52,398
Then you obey only...

385
00:33:52,597 --> 00:34:06,856
His order was wrong. I cannot serve human beings if I am immobilised. You gave me power. Your orders are right. I serve you.

386
00:34:06,982 --> 00:34:11,309
Lesterson. Lesterson, it reasons. Just how limited is its intelligence?

387
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:22,494
Now, there is no cause for... for concern, Governor. Just you wait until you see the amount of work it can do! And now, I'm really going to put you through your paces. Follow me, Dalek.

388
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:24,755
I obey.

389
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:36,658
Excellent. excellent.

390
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,767
But I thought we were after the Daleks, not this control unit you've nicked!

391
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,878
Ah, yes!

392
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:48,127
He's a right little delinquent, isn't he?

393
00:34:48,412 --> 00:34:50,657
Doctor, what on Earth are you up to?

394
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:52,423
Ooh!

395
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:55,926
Ah! Now we're really getting somewhere!

396
00:34:57,773 --> 00:35:01,109
Now, the Examiner was attacked, there can be no question of that.

397
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,916
And the button grabbed by the Examiner was missing from your suit.

398
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:06,598
Yes, if you've got anything to add to that, you'd better say it now.

399
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:11,091
I didn't attack the man. I had no reason to. I was the one that sent for him!

400
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:13,921
You sent for him?!

401
00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:19,216
It was necessary. Under the circumstances, I'd hardly be likely to sabotage the radio communications.

402
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,740
But... but why Quinn? Why?

403
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:23,225
Because of the rebels!

404
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:25,952
The rebels! They're nothing more than one or two fanatics.

405
00:35:26,185 --> 00:35:27,156
You know as well as I do that they...

406
00:35:27,414 --> 00:35:31,372
Unless you're trying to create trouble here - to undermine the Governor's position.

407
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:34,966
Bragen, you'd better explain that.

408
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:42,380
If you're removed, who takes your place? The Deputy Governor, of course. And that's the real reason behind all this trouble, isn't it Quinn?

409
00:35:42,655 --> 00:35:43,226
Go on.

410
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:49,013
You attack the Examiner in the mercury swamp and blame it on the rebels. Then you sabotage the radio - blame that on the rebels too.

411
00:35:50,142 --> 00:35:51,552
Get him out of my sight!

412
00:35:51,877 --> 00:35:54,664
Hensell, before you listen to these preposterous allegations...

413
00:36:01,138 --> 00:36:08,167
I chose Quinn myself. I trained him for the job. Why, in a few years time, he'd have had this seat!

414
00:36:08,495 --> 00:36:11,527
Sometimes Governor, a few years is a long time to wait.

415
00:36:15,678 --> 00:36:16,597
Oh, Bragen?

416
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,731
Governor?

417
00:36:19,169 --> 00:36:25,373
You will assume Quinn's duties. As of now, you are Deputy Governor.

418
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,381
Look Doctor, I don't want to appear dim, but how's this going to do the Daleks in?

419
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:39,397
They think that Lesterson's the driving force, but I don't. The Daleks are using him.

420
00:36:39,757 --> 00:36:40,631
But how?

421
00:36:40,872 --> 00:36:49,913
Problem. Smash the Daleks, and the people here will lock us up or kill us. Let the Daleks go, and we'll all be exterminated.

422
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:53,644
We could just go back to the TARDIS. At least we'd be safe to think there.

423
00:36:54,062 --> 00:36:55,589
Oh yes, that's coming on.

424
00:36:55,705 --> 00:36:57,556
Oh, you talk to him, will you?

425
00:36:57,794 --> 00:37:00,704
Doctor look, if you told us what you were up to, perhaps we could help you.

426
00:37:01,183 --> 00:37:11,349
Mustn't underestimate any of them. Lesterson's a first class scientist, first class. He opened the capsule. He realised that the Daleks could be reactivated.

427
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:19,947
Yeah, that could be the answer. Let's kidnap Lesterson, and hide him away for a bit. Well, it would stop him bringing the Daleks back to life, wouldn't it?

428
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:22,461
I thought it was pretty bright.

429
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:23,834
There we are.

430
00:37:24,474 --> 00:37:25,491
What is it?

431
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:33,371
What is it? It could be the answer to all our problems.

432
00:37:34,327 --> 00:37:38,022
Incredible! Well, let's move on to test fourteen.

433
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:40,009
I am ready.

434
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:45,516
When sodium acts on ethyl alcohol, what is the resulting derivative?

435
00:37:46,026 --> 00:37:52,019
Sodium ethoxide. C2 H5 ONa.

436
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:56,866
Just five seconds, Janley! Just the time it took to speak the answer.

437
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,894
Right too.

438
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:07,823
But of course it's right! Look, can you imagine what kind of positronic brain this robot has, Janley? Think of the store of knowledge that it must carry.

439
00:38:07,977 --> 00:38:08,695
May I come in?

440
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:09,883
What do you want?

441
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:12,451
Oh, ah, just to see how you're getting on.

442
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:13,395
If you think...

443
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:18,303
No, please! I'm... I'm not here to cause trouble. I... I'm just interested, that's all.

444
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:21,262
You've done nothing but meddle and interfere ever since you landed on Vulcan.

445
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:27,607
Well, I... I did give you permission to open up the capsule, now didn't I? Please, carry on.

446
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,177
And you won't try to stop me?

447
00:38:30,523 --> 00:38:40,599
Stop you? No, of course not. We get off on the wrong foot, Lesterson, but... but I'm a reasonable man and... and I've been thinking, perhaps I was hasty.

448
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:44,017
Well, if you... if you... if you really want to call a truce.

449
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:47,524
A truce? My dear fellow, I... I'd like to be friends!

450
00:38:48,063 --> 00:38:51,969
Yes. Yes. Very well, you may stay.

451
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:54,861
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

452
00:38:56,102 --> 00:39:00,399
Laboratory. Yes.

453
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,911
All right, I can come now. Right.

454
00:39:11,122 --> 00:39:14,555
I just have to slip out for a few minutes, Lesterson, alright?

455
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:19,101
Ah, yes, yes. Um, very well then. Examiner, shall we test its knowledge of physics?

456
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:22,451
Oh, oh, splendid, splendid. Ah, huh, please, please, carry on.

457
00:39:22,732 --> 00:39:26,551
Thank you. D... what is the First Law of Thermodynamics?

458
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:51,002
When heat is transformed into any other kind of energy or vice versa, the total quantity of energy remains invariable. That is to say, the quantity of heat which disappears is equivalent to the quantity of other kind of energy produced...

459
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,970
Fool! What do you think you're doing?

460
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:55,309
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!...

461
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:57,135
I'm saving your life!

462
00:39:57,955 --> 00:39:59,308
Get out! Get out!

463
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,791
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... I have, ah, sustained no damage.

464
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:14,175
You were able to get away then?

465
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:17,209
Yes. Lesterson's with the Examiner. And Hensell?

466
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:20,291
At a meeting of production managers. He left me in control.

467
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:23,209
We could take over the colony now.

468
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:30,004
No. No it has to be absolutely right. I don't want to take over a colony full of rebels do I, Janley?

469
00:40:30,244 --> 00:40:32,672
Well, I don't know. You're making me help them.

470
00:40:32,983 --> 00:40:43,726
Only to stir them up to create enough trouble to get rid of Hensell, and then... and then we crush them. The whole colony will be grateful, and I'll be Governor.

471
00:40:46,216 --> 00:40:47,614
Is that the gun you told me of?

472
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:50,419
Can you persuade the rebels this will help them?

473
00:40:50,693 --> 00:40:53,620
Yes, Valmar thinks he can work in a switch to turn it on and off.

474
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:55,012
How powerful is it?

475
00:40:55,385 --> 00:41:02,161
It killed Resno, Lesterson's assistant, and Lesterson believes that Resno's simply shaken up - taking a few days off.

476
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:03,347
And the body?

477
00:41:03,835 --> 00:41:16,841
In the mercury swamp. Lesterson was the indirect cause of Resno's death. It's a good hold over him if he makes trouble. I'll give this to Valmar then?

478
00:41:16,905 --> 00:41:17,478
Yes.

479
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:19,020
When do we move?

480
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:23,052
I need another card in my hand. The Examiner bothers me.

481
00:41:23,387 --> 00:41:24,790
I thought Quinn was the danger.

482
00:41:25,072 --> 00:41:31,625
Uh, not any more. The Examiner is no fool. No, there has to be something else.

483
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:37,525
Well?

484
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:40,122
Well, he's not in the laboratory, Lesterson's by himself.

485
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,839
Hmm. He must have gone another way. Can I leave it you? I'm going to go back to the rest room.

486
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:44,730
Well, but...

487
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,341
Well, somebody's got to clear it up.

488
00:41:46,692 --> 00:41:47,256
Okay.

489
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,685
Hello there.

490
00:41:56,006 --> 00:41:58,650
Hello. Um, you're Lesterson's assistant aren't you?

491
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,056
Yes. You're not looking for the Examiner are you?

492
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:02,843
Well, do you know where he is?

493
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:06,457
Yes, he's waiting to get a message through from Earth. He's in the Communications Room.

494
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,781
Umm...

495
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,456
Oh, you'll find it easy enough. Look. Around, then to your right, in the next block.

496
00:42:12,714 --> 00:42:13,416
Thanks very much.

497
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:25,109
Doctor? Anyone here?

498
00:42:34,398 --> 00:42:40,810
She said she was coming back here. She knew the way, and she wouldn't have wandered off. I know she wouldn't! Oh!

499
00:42:41,747 --> 00:42:46,818
Ben, if you were a Dalek what would be your next move?

500
00:42:47,071 --> 00:42:48,629
I'm talking about Polly.

501
00:42:48,974 --> 00:42:51,583
Oh, no, no, no, no. She's a clever girl, but she couldn't answer this.

502
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:52,956
But she is missing!

503
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:54,283
Oh, no, no, no.

504
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:55,754
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!

505
00:42:56,053 --> 00:43:02,112
No, no, no! She's looking around, there's a lot to see in the colony. She's interested. I like that.

506
00:43:05,439 --> 00:43:05,939
Come on.

507
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,231
Where are we going?

508
00:43:07,463 --> 00:43:09,987
To report it. If we make a fool of ourselves, I don't care! We report it!

509
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:20,510
Yes, yes, yes. I managed to stop that fool of an Examiner just in time. You know there are some people here who believe that you're an enemy.

510
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:23,693
I am your servant.

511
00:43:28,928 --> 00:43:31,771
What does this machine do?

512
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:37,236
You know, it's amazing. You have an almost human interest and curiosity.

513
00:43:37,368 --> 00:43:46,953
A Dalek is bet... is not the same as a human. If I am to help, I must know everything.

514
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,484
Yes. Yes, of course.

515
00:43:48,786 --> 00:43:50,567
What is this machine?

516
00:43:50,874 --> 00:43:54,174
It computes meteorite storms as they approach our weather satellites.

517
00:43:54,522 --> 00:43:56,414
How accurate is it?

518
00:43:56,776 --> 00:44:01,785
About, ah, seventy percent. It helps to cut down on our satellite losses.

519
00:44:01,898 --> 00:44:07,602
Daleks can build pu... computers with one hundred percent accuracy.

520
00:44:07,997 --> 00:44:09,370
One hundred percent?

521
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:16,670
If you provide materials and our own power unit, a computer will be built.

522
00:44:17,122 --> 00:44:21,703
A hundred percent. That would be an enormous saving for the... for the colony!

523
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:24,429
Then, you will get the materials?

524
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:26,280
I'll go and speak to the Governor at once.

525
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:31,747
I will be ready to dictate the blueprint when you return.

526
00:44:32,354 --> 00:44:35,367
Huh, huh. Oh, that's marvellous!

527
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:08,455
You agreed we'd go and see Bragen.

528
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:09,893
Hmm? Power.

529
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,956
Come on then!

530
00:45:12,557 --> 00:45:14,925
Now the energy intake for Daleks should be the cube...

531
00:45:16,536 --> 00:45:17,428
Lesterson!

532
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:18,075
Eh?

533
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:21,454
He just went past. That means we can get into his laboratory again.

534
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:22,518
But we're looking for...

535
00:45:23,085 --> 00:45:24,371
Oh, come along, Ben. Come along.

536
00:45:25,381 --> 00:45:26,622
There's somebody in there.

537
00:45:27,567 --> 00:45:30,150
What are you doing here?

538
00:45:31,399 --> 00:45:35,003
Stand aside. Servants shouldn't question.

539
00:45:35,307 --> 00:45:37,166
Entry is restricted.

540
00:45:37,466 --> 00:45:40,645
Not for me it isn't. "Accord every access". I've got a badge.

541
00:45:40,948 --> 00:45:42,156
That is an order.

542
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:45,651
A Dalek order. Short circuit the generator, Ben.

543
00:45:46,028 --> 00:45:51,529
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Stand back!

544
00:45:51,757 --> 00:45:55,675
Don't be frightened of it Ben. It's not armed. I'm going to see what it was doing in there.

545
00:46:05,612 --> 00:46:09,887
Ben, let's get out of here!

546
00:46:10,914 --> 00:46:12,877
Fool. Lesterson must have reactivated them.

547
00:46:13,085 --> 00:46:17,041
Yes. When I say run, Run!

548
00:46:23,253 --> 00:46:29,661
I have sent the human being for materials.

549
00:46:29,903 --> 00:46:31,016
And power?

550
00:46:31,412 --> 00:46:39,109
Yes. Power we can turn into static, then we will conquer.

551
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:47,525
We will conquer... We will conquer... We will conquer...

552
00:46:47,759 --> 00:46:52,750
But if you didn't do it Lesterson, then the Dalek must have used your power supply and reactivated the others itself.

553
00:46:52,965 --> 00:46:54,671
I was going to do that anyway.

554
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:57,186
Are you off your head, mate? Those two are armed!

555
00:46:57,671 --> 00:47:02,056
Then we turn off the electricity, disarm them, and then everything is safe again.

556
00:47:02,328 --> 00:47:03,506
I've already explained to you.

557
00:47:03,741 --> 00:47:11,192
Stop these arguments, both of you. I've had enough. I've every confidence in Lesterson. He has carte blanche for the Daleks from now on.

558
00:47:11,386 --> 00:47:13,083
But they must be destroyed!

559
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:19,816
Bragen, I'm making a tour of the perimeter. I put you in direct charge here. See that Lesterson gets everything he wants, will you?

560
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:25,004
I shall need a permanent guard on my laboratory, Bragen.

561
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:31,787
Don't worry about the Examiner. I think I can keep him quiet.

562
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:40,716
Greed and ambition, that's all it is. Wait till they find out what their precious production figures have cost them!

563
00:47:40,951 --> 00:47:42,145
Oh, I want to see you.

564
00:47:43,281 --> 00:47:44,240
What about?

565
00:47:44,508 --> 00:47:46,507
Well it's Polly, she's missing. We can't find her anywhere.

566
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:50,470
I'll tell one of my men to make enquiries. It shouldn't take long to find her.

567
00:47:50,806 --> 00:47:51,624
Ah, thanks.

568
00:47:52,574 --> 00:48:02,461
Examiner, some of my men have found a body in the mercury swamp. It was the body of a middle-aged man.

569
00:48:03,074 --> 00:48:04,451
What is that to do with me?

570
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:08,177
You're the Examiner - or maybe you're not.

571
00:48:14,443 --> 00:48:16,440
Just exactly what do you mean by that?

572
00:48:17,066 --> 00:48:20,087
Who are you? Quinn's friends? Come to stir up rebellion?

573
00:48:20,873 --> 00:48:24,331
There's only one possible way that you could know I'm not the Examiner.

574
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,526
Yeah, by knowing what the real Examiner looked like!

575
00:48:27,868 --> 00:48:36,394
Exactly, Ben. Exactly! Only two people knew of his arrival on this planet. Myself and his murderer.

576
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:37,724
That's enough!

577
00:48:38,017 --> 00:48:40,304
Is it? Doctor, we've got to tell the Governor.

578
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:46,999
Do you think he'll believe you? I'll soon convince him that you murdered the man yourself. You stole the Examiner's badge.

579
00:48:48,107 --> 00:48:54,577
Then why don't you arrest us? Because there's a doubt isn't there? Because it might, it just might, go against you.

580
00:48:54,867 --> 00:49:02,653
All right, all right, so neither of us wants to make a move. But you leave Lesterson alone - and the Daleks!

581
00:49:09,156 --> 00:49:11,356
He'd make a right Father Christmas, wouldn't he?

582
00:49:11,605 --> 00:49:15,402
Oh, I'd rather fight a hundred of his sort than just one Dalek.

583
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,042
Listen to this. "The girl is safe. She will remain so as long as you leave the Daleks alone".

584
00:49:34,461 --> 00:49:36,585
And did you disarm the other two?

585
00:49:37,136 --> 00:49:43,036
Yes. We are your servants. We do not need guns.

586
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:47,045
I'm very glad. I knew the Examiner was wrong about you.

587
00:49:47,387 --> 00:49:49,435
Did you get our materials?

588
00:49:49,731 --> 00:49:52,251
Yes. Everything you need you can have.

589
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,848
And a power plant?

590
00:49:54,921 --> 00:49:56,007
Everything.

591
00:50:05,384 --> 00:50:08,722
We will get our power.

592
00:50:09,156 --> 00:50:18,423
We will get our power. We will get our power. We will get our power. We will...
593
00:50:27,043 --> 00:50:33,224
Turn back the power supply.

594
00:50:33,496 --> 00:50:38,024
I will, I will. But I want you to remember that I control you.

595
00:50:38,522 --> 00:50:43,478
We are your servants.

596
00:50:43,871 --> 00:50:56,846
I know. Remember it. I gave you each a special charge to bring you back to life. Any further power you need must come from this generator. And I control it. Is that clear?

597
00:50:57,163 --> 00:50:59,659
We obey.

598
00:51:12,348 --> 00:51:13,659
Where are they going?

599
00:51:13,979 --> 00:51:19,070
To await your orders, master.

600
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:23,755
Good. Have you completed the blueprints for the meteor storm computer?

601
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,536
It is ready.

602
00:51:33,017 --> 00:51:44,135
Oh, it's marvellous! I'm glad we understand each other.

603
00:51:44,224 --> 00:51:49,529
We understand the human mind.

604
00:51:52,464 --> 00:51:53,638
Isn't that finished yet?

605
00:51:54,026 --> 00:51:54,901
Nearly.

606
00:51:55,022 --> 00:51:58,060
About time. This work should have been completed long before this.

607
00:51:58,303 --> 00:51:59,422
Well, I did the best I could!

608
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:00,721
Well, it isn't good enough!

609
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:02,704
Then get someone else, Bragen.

610
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:07,222
Be careful! I shall be watching you, Valmar, after this - now get out!

611
00:52:11,217 --> 00:52:12,591
What does this intrusion mean?

612
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,114
I'm sorry, Bragen. I tried to stop them.

613
00:52:15,372 --> 00:52:24,397
Intrusion? It's no intrusion. We're just returning the various calls that you made. This guard tried to tell us you were busy. You're not a bit, are you?

614
00:52:24,751 --> 00:52:25,844
All right - I'll see them.

615
00:52:26,205 --> 00:52:32,831
Oh, what a nice new uniform. Very smart, very smart. I would like a hat like that.

616
00:52:33,286 --> 00:52:34,321
Well, what do you want?

617
00:52:34,591 --> 00:52:36,984
Some joker has kidnapped Polly and sent us this note.

618
00:52:37,264 --> 00:52:37,936
Yes.

619
00:52:38,232 --> 00:52:40,062
Well, we want to know what you're doing to find her.

620
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:43,145
Now that the communications are restored we can start a search.

621
00:52:43,482 --> 00:52:47,054
Yeah, I can just imagine what kind of job you'll make of that. Haven't you heard anything yet?

622
00:52:47,268 --> 00:52:48,710
The planet is a large one.

623
00:52:53,364 --> 00:52:56,901
So! They've given you the run of the colony, have they?

624
00:52:57,383 --> 00:53:07,060
We obey. Do I bring liquid for your visitors?

625
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:09,607
No. They won't be staying much longer.

626
00:53:19,754 --> 00:53:22,460
Look, Doctor, if he's not going to help us, we'll have to search for Polly ourselves.

627
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:25,537
Sound advice. Why don't you, Doctor?

628
00:53:25,878 --> 00:53:28,672
Ah, ah, Examiner.

629
00:53:29,603 --> 00:53:33,353
I wonder how much longer they'll be able to move around on these floors?

630
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:34,117
Eh?

631
00:53:34,207 --> 00:53:40,737
Static you see. They need a constant supply of static from the floor, some sort of electrical field.

632
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,731
Doctor. Why should he...?

633
00:54:03,812 --> 00:54:04,591
It's madness!

634
00:54:04,956 --> 00:54:05,562
What is?

635
00:54:05,794 --> 00:54:08,661
Letting them run around like this.

636
00:54:09,669 --> 00:54:13,893
Hey, wait a minute! Bragen had one acting as a servant, and we've just left him!

637
00:54:14,575 --> 00:54:19,533
One Dalek in Bragen's office - three Daleks just gone down the corridors. That makes four!

638
00:54:20,426 --> 00:54:21,845
Where did the fourth one come from?

639
00:54:22,831 --> 00:54:29,535
Well, Lesterson can't have been making them. Perhaps there were more in the capsule than we thought?

640
00:54:30,486 --> 00:54:31,098
Janley?

641
00:54:31,825 --> 00:54:32,437
What is it?

642
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:35,613
The Daleks. They've given me another list of materials they need.

643
00:54:35,846 --> 00:54:38,839
Let me see. We've got all those things?

644
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:47,417
Yes, but why these quantities, Janley? Why? How can they have used up all the materials I gave them? What is it? D... why, it's only a matter of a few hours ago.

645
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:49,080
They're building new things for us.

646
00:54:49,274 --> 00:54:54,626
Yes, well I don't want them to do anything without consulting me. What is it they do inside there?

647
00:54:54,869 --> 00:54:56,235
You're worrying too much.

648
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:09,744
Look Janley, say what you like, but I'm beginning to believe that the Examiner is right about the Daleks. Their original thinking terrifies me. If we can control them, fine. But if not...

649
00:55:11,472 --> 00:55:11,982
Yes?

650
00:55:13,401 --> 00:55:22,534
Then I shall have them destroyed. It's too dangerous. The Examiner knows something about them that we don't. I'm going to ask his advice.

651
00:55:23,322 --> 00:55:26,387
I wouldn't bring the Examiner into it if I were you.

652
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,144
And why not?

653
00:55:27,644 --> 00:55:29,960
You want him to find out about Resno?

654
00:55:30,466 --> 00:55:32,880
Oh, a little accident. How is he? Is he better?

655
00:55:33,089 --> 00:55:33,809
He's dead.

656
00:55:36,221 --> 00:55:39,085
What are you talking about? You told me he was...

657
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:41,342
You're busy with the experiments on the Daleks.

658
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:47,729
But you should have told me. But... but the body - it'll have to be reported.

659
00:55:48,074 --> 00:55:50,497
Don't worry, no one will find the body.

660
00:55:51,946 --> 00:55:56,174
Oh Janley, you've done a terrible thing.

661
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,660
The experiments on the Daleks were more important.

662
00:55:59,044 --> 00:56:01,948
More important than human life? No. No, I won't accept that.

663
00:56:03,513 --> 00:56:13,282
You will. You must! Your carelessness was the cause of Resno's death. You murdered him. It's only your word against mine.

664
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:17,987
I won't be blackmailed by you!

665
00:56:18,398 --> 00:56:23,085
All I want is for you to go on as you are. Scientific discovery can't stop dead, Lesterson.

666
00:56:24,526 --> 00:56:26,754
I told the guard that no-one was to be allowed in.

667
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,710
"Accord every access" remember?

668
00:56:28,935 --> 00:56:30,145
We're looking for Polly.

669
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:32,350
Well, she isn't here, and I haven't seen her.

670
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:33,567
Well, she's been kidnapped.

671
00:56:33,806 --> 00:56:35,203
Oh, it sounds a little unlikely.

672
00:56:35,383 --> 00:56:37,541
Oh it does, does it? Well, we've got this note which tells us so.

673
00:56:37,678 --> 00:56:40,408
I'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about it.

674
00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:42,300
Lesterson?

675
00:56:42,584 --> 00:56:43,067
Yes?

676
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:46,699
You haven't been building Daleks, have you?

677
00:56:46,891 --> 00:56:49,894
Building? No I wouldn't know how to begin.

678
00:56:50,132 --> 00:56:52,325
And there were only three in the capsule?

679
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:53,162
Yes.

680
00:56:54,764 --> 00:56:59,813
Well we've just seen four. One in the Governor's office and three in the corridor!

681
00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:02,899
But that's not possible!

682
00:57:03,277 --> 00:57:07,334
There's only one explanation. The Daleks are reproducing themselves!

683
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,830
These things are machines. How could they reproduce?

684
00:57:10,124 --> 00:57:18,677
Machines! What makes you think they're just machines. The Daleks are brilliant engineers. Nothing is beyond them given the right materials.

685
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:20,745
What?

686
00:57:21,979 --> 00:57:24,197
I said nothing is beyond them given the right materials.

687
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:25,184
Oh...

688
00:57:25,419 --> 00:57:26,610
Lesterson, what's the matter?

689
00:57:26,928 --> 00:57:27,358
Oh...

690
00:57:28,702 --> 00:57:30,679
Leave him alone. He's just been overworking, that's all.

691
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,756
Well, he looks bad.

692
00:57:31,957 --> 00:57:38,060
Will you both go away. Guard! It's you - badgering him with questions. You've done nothing but hound him ever since you arrived on Vulcan.

693
00:57:38,731 --> 00:57:40,648
Bragen's orders were that no one was to be admitted.

694
00:57:40,976 --> 00:57:42,188
Yes, but I thought that the... the Examiner.

695
00:57:42,414 --> 00:57:44,822
He attacked Lesterson. Get them out of here. Both of them.

696
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,089
He did not attack Lesterson.

697
00:57:46,444 --> 00:57:47,246
Out, do you hear?!

698
00:57:49,593 --> 00:57:50,655
All right, all right.

699
00:57:56,874 --> 00:58:01,346
Janley here. Tell Valmar to come over to the lab right away. Good.

700
00:58:03,788 --> 00:58:06,453
Well, we're still no nearer finding Polly. What are we hanging about here for?

701
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:09,549
Ben, I've found a message in code.

702
00:58:09,827 --> 00:58:10,989
Oh, I can't do crosswords.

703
00:58:12,634 --> 00:58:22,932
Meeting tonight, 2000 hours. R O C K E T - Rocket. R O O M - Room. P. Rocket Room P!

704
00:58:30,445 --> 00:58:36,235
It's the rebels way of calling a meeting. Only tonight we're going to be there - early.

705
00:58:36,853 --> 00:58:39,539
Yeah, maybe we're nearer finding Polly than I thought.

706
00:58:59,256 --> 00:59:12,760
Now, we're going to demonstrate something. You section leaders can pass on what you've seen. So far, we've been concerned with testing the strength of the Governor with a few acts of sabotage. But now, we're ready to take over.

707
00:59:13,311 --> 00:59:18,719
What is that thing? I've seen them moving about, but all we've been told is that it's a machine Lesterson discovered.

708
00:59:18,974 --> 00:59:19,693
Valmar?

709
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:29,933
Well, Lesterson removed the armaments of the Daleks he discovered. I've rearmed this one, but with a controlling device. We can regulate the fire power and turn it off and on whenever we choose.

710
00:59:31,017 --> 00:59:32,390
Shall we have the demonstration now?

711
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:40,918
This screen is two inch thick tungsten steel. Right, Valmar.

712
00:59:42,742 --> 00:59:45,007
Fire at the screen.

713
00:59:49,064 --> 00:59:51,918
Quiet! You must keep quiet. We're too vulnerable here.

714
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:54,013
But, you can't control a thing like that. It'll turn on us!

715
00:59:54,182 --> 00:59:55,031
No it won't.

716
00:59:55,769 --> 00:59:56,818
Now, what about the girl?

717
00:59:58,016 --> 00:59:59,720
We've got her safely locked up. Never fear.

718
00:59:59,957 --> 01:00:01,206
I think the best thing for us to do is...

719
01:00:01,353 --> 01:00:02,781
Hear that? Maybe they'll say were she is.

720
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:04,686
Who's there?

721
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:06,856
You stay there, I'll distract them. Find out where Polly is.

722
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:07,647
No!

723
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:08,579
Help! Help!

724
01:00:08,895 --> 01:00:11,353
The guards will have heard that! Come on we've got to get out of here!

725
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:14,019
You might as well come out. We know you're there.

726
01:00:24,341 --> 01:00:25,331
Bragen!

727
01:00:25,587 --> 01:00:28,377
Of course. Who else is fitted to be leader of the rebels?

728
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:30,660
No doubt you want to be leader of the Daleks too.

729
01:00:30,866 --> 01:00:32,385
I am the leader of the Daleks.

730
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:34,824
Well see if you can stop this one from killing me.

731
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:44,409
Stop! You heard me, that's an order. Turn away. Fetch the guard.

732
01:00:47,036 --> 01:00:50,554
I obey.

733
01:00:56,297 --> 01:01:02,468
You hope to have it both ways, Bragen. But how will you look in front of the Governor, when I explain your dual role to him?

734
01:01:02,689 --> 01:01:04,699
The Governor will hardly listen to an impostor.

735
01:01:05,095 --> 01:01:08,118
An impostor? How do you propose to prove that?

736
01:01:08,629 --> 01:01:12,339
My guards are now going to produce the body of the real Examiner from the mercury swamp.

737
01:01:12,603 --> 01:01:13,726
The one you murdered.

738
01:01:13,901 --> 01:01:15,039
The one you pretended to be.

739
01:01:15,287 --> 01:01:18,920
Murder's a far worse crime than impersonation.

740
01:01:19,146 --> 01:01:24,619
Yes, but you can't prove I'm a murderer, while I can prove that you're an impostor.

741
01:01:32,033 --> 01:01:33,390
Ah... Oh...

742
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,282
You sent for me?

743
01:01:44,587 --> 01:01:52,569
Take up a position at the communications room. Watch and report.

744
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:54,589
I obey.

745
01:01:57,478 --> 01:02:07,385
They're conspiring together! Oh, why didn't I realise? The Examiner was right. They are evil!

746
01:02:19,165 --> 01:02:24,786
There are four. They can't be reproducing!

747
01:05:15,841 --> 01:05:17,634
Dalek nine complete.

748
01:05:17,938 --> 01:05:18,314
Check.

749
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,447
Dalek ten complete.

750
01:05:21,665 --> 01:05:22,383
Check.

751
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:24,491
Dalek eleven complete.

752
01:05:24,804 --> 01:05:25,246
Check.

753
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:27,931
Dalek twelve complete.

754
01:05:28,268 --> 01:05:28,676
Check.

755
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:31,711
Dalek thirteen complete.

756
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:32,446
Check.

757
01:05:32,743 --> 01:05:35,468
Dalek fourteen complete.

758
01:05:35,818 --> 01:05:46,101
We are the Daleks! We are the new race of Daleks!

759
01:06:13,042 --> 01:06:13,737
What's the matter? What is it?

760
01:06:15,203 --> 01:06:15,544
Are you ill?

761
01:06:16,151 --> 01:06:21,543
They're in there - making themselves! Duplicating!

762
01:06:21,789 --> 01:06:23,160
What? What are you talking about?

763
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:26,982
I started this, opening the capsule!

764
01:06:27,225 --> 01:06:27,909
Lesterson!

765
01:06:28,127 --> 01:06:29,218
Don't try to stop me!

766
01:06:29,387 --> 01:06:30,265
What happened?

767
01:06:34,182 --> 01:06:44,877
They forget that I control them! I gave them life back again, and now I've taken it away! Finished! Stopped it!

768
01:06:45,387 --> 01:06:46,318
The Daleks...

769
01:06:47,153 --> 01:07:01,114
Evil! Horrible! I know what I'm going to do! Laser torches! Melt them down! I'm going to melt the Daleks down to pools of metal!

770
01:07:01,354 --> 01:07:02,303
You won't Lesterson!

771
01:07:02,534 --> 01:07:12,898
Ah, do you think I care what you can do?! Go on, tell everybody I was responsible for Resno's death! I don't care! I'm going to wipe out the Daleks!

772
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:19,448
Yes, tell everybody all about me! I'm still going to... I'm going to... wipe out the Daleks!

773
01:07:19,699 --> 01:07:28,561
Get me the Examiner. But I've got to talk to him! I've got to, don't you understand?!

774
01:07:35,853 --> 01:07:40,132
How did you get there?! I cut off the power!

775
01:07:40,368 --> 01:07:45,793
We can store power. We will soon have our own.

776
01:07:47,135 --> 01:07:48,147
Own power?!

777
01:07:48,435 --> 01:07:51,288
Why was the capsule door closed?

778
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,105
Own power?! Ahh!

779
01:08:01,726 --> 01:08:05,520
Seal off the capsule's secret entrance.

780
01:08:05,757 --> 01:08:06,872
I obey.

781
01:08:07,612 --> 01:08:08,783
Wait!

782
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:15,388
No more than three Daleks to be seen together at any one time.

783
01:08:15,632 --> 01:08:16,861
I obey.

784
01:08:17,602 --> 01:08:26,003
We are not ready yet to teach these human beings the law of the Daleks.

785
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:36,566
Well, Bragen - these trips are becoming more and more demanding.

786
01:08:36,995 --> 01:08:38,177
I didn't expect you, Governor.

787
01:08:38,424 --> 01:08:42,378
Ah, I had as much as I could stand. Well? What's been happening here?

788
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:43,934
One moment.

789
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:45,571
I asked you a question, man.

790
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:46,916
I heard you.

791
01:08:47,328 --> 01:08:51,983
Look, your work can wait. You can hand over to me tomorrow. I want to hear about the Examiner.

792
01:08:52,784 --> 01:09:00,082
He's an impostor, Governor. Possibly a murderer as well. We have just discovered the body of the real Examiner in the mercury swamp.

793
01:09:01,764 --> 01:09:04,396
I hope you're sure of your facts, Bragen.

794
01:09:04,624 --> 01:09:05,330
Quite sure.

795
01:09:06,181 --> 01:09:09,074
This could have far-reaching consequences.

796
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:13,537
As far as I am concerned, there's nothing more to be said. So if there's nothing further...

797
01:09:13,718 --> 01:09:18,646
Nothing further! Who the devil do you think you're talking to? Stand up when you're speaking to me man!

798
01:09:19,877 --> 01:09:22,145
I prefer to remain seated.

799
01:09:22,417 --> 01:09:26,196
Do you now?! We'll soon see about that. Guards!

800
01:09:27,117 --> 01:09:28,677
Take this man out of my office.

801
01:09:30,055 --> 01:09:32,179
Did you hear what I said? That's an order!

802
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:35,398
You forget, my dear Hensell. They're not your guards - they're mine.

803
01:09:35,556 --> 01:09:36,580
I am the Governor!

804
01:09:36,863 --> 01:09:41,472
No. Not now. I am.

805
01:09:42,002 --> 01:09:48,887
Oh, I see. Your guards, eh? Yes, Quinn warned me about your guards, but we all took them too lightly, didn't we?

806
01:09:49,074 --> 01:09:52,018
When the people hear that I am being kept a prisoner in my own capital...

807
01:09:52,253 --> 01:09:54,786
The people will do exactly as they are told, Hensell.

808
01:09:56,564 --> 01:10:00,543
It will, of course, be easier for them if you co-operate with us.

809
01:10:10,518 --> 01:10:12,777
You're the last man I expected to see here.

810
01:10:13,081 --> 01:10:17,592
Well your imprisonment hasn't been entirely wasted. It's brought your enemy out into...

811
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,798
Bragen? I've known that all along.

812
01:10:19,973 --> 01:10:22,975
Yes. But, ah, did you know that he was the leader of the rebels?

813
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:24,873
Hmm. Work's by sound, does it?

814
01:10:31,386 --> 01:10:34,837
Wait there. Guards, dismissed.

815
01:10:39,596 --> 01:10:43,905
So Bragen, you want my co-operation, do you?

816
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:48,936
It would save bloodshed. I might even let you keep the title of Governor.

817
01:10:49,596 --> 01:10:56,608
Might you now?! I'll tell you what you will do. You'll order your guards to disarm and place yourself under arrest immediately!

818
01:10:57,172 --> 01:11:01,843
So you reject my offer? I thought it a generous one in the circumstances.

819
01:11:02,059 --> 01:11:04,610
What circumstances?

820
01:11:04,836 --> 01:11:05,545
Look at this.

821
01:11:06,797 --> 01:11:07,774
What is it?

822
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:10,322
The reason that the colony is now mine.

823
01:11:14,014 --> 01:11:17,504
Is it a weapon of some kind?

824
01:11:17,721 --> 01:11:22,268
I'll arrange a demonstration for you. Do you still refuse my offer?

825
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:25,254
I will not be intimidated.

826
01:11:25,556 --> 01:11:32,299
Of course not. In character to the last, Hensell. Kill him!

827
01:11:43,251 --> 01:11:48,183
Why do human beings kill human beings?

828
01:11:48,502 --> 01:11:49,438
Get on with your work!

829
01:11:49,551 --> 01:11:52,118
Yes, master. I obey.

830
01:11:52,354 --> 01:12:02,624
Yes, obey me! From now on, I will have complete obedience from everyone!

831
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:13,077
I'll have to check the cable circuit now. Otherwise, it's just as you asked for.

832
01:12:14,245 --> 01:12:15,231
Very well.

833
01:12:15,518 --> 01:12:19,309
Why can't you carry on with the power you're drawing from the colony? Why go to all this trouble?

834
01:12:19,553 --> 01:12:31,916
Until now, we have had to recharge from the colony supply. With static power, the Daleks will be twice as useful.

835
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:32,854
Valmar, quick!

836
01:12:33,188 --> 01:12:33,687
What's the matter?

837
01:12:33,866 --> 01:12:34,397
The Governor's back.

838
01:12:34,626 --> 01:12:35,280
What about the girl?

839
01:12:35,473 --> 01:12:36,045
Leave her.

840
01:12:36,412 --> 01:12:37,264
I will follow you.

841
01:12:37,461 --> 01:12:38,168
What for?

842
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:40,540
I am your servant.

843
01:12:41,302 --> 01:12:41,786
Come on.

844
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:55,326
An electrical circuit of their own supplying static electricity! I wonder how much longer we've got?

845
01:12:56,323 --> 01:12:59,098
I didn't realise they'd have a circuit of their own.

846
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,809
Doctor, look out!

847
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,330
Are you all right?

848
01:13:18,575 --> 01:13:21,279
Well done! Who was the man who went outside just now?

849
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:23,188
Valmar. He's been working for the Daleks.

850
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,447
On their static power supply.

851
01:13:24,598 --> 01:13:25,591
Doctor, they've got Ben.

852
01:13:25,728 --> 01:13:31,287
Yes, I know. He ran away so that I could... Oh well, it's a long story, but don't worry. That boy can take care of himself!

853
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:33,007
Did you hear that? That won't help.

854
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:33,961
Get out! All of you!

855
01:13:34,115 --> 01:13:34,892
What about you?!

856
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:35,807
But Doctor! Oh...

857
01:13:36,085 --> 01:13:36,693
Go!

858
01:13:51,232 --> 01:13:52,800
Have they escaped?

859
01:13:53,015 --> 01:13:56,775
Yes, return to capsule and report.

860
01:13:57,005 --> 01:13:58,446
I obey.

861
01:14:14,018 --> 01:14:20,349
We are to wait here until the human beings fight among themselves.

862
01:14:20,658 --> 01:14:22,734
Then we will strike.

863
01:14:23,015 --> 01:14:42,966
And exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! ...

864
01:14:44,174 --> 01:14:47,533
But why? Why was he killed?

865
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:48,624
I can answer that.

866
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:54,558
He wanted to destroy the Daleks, so one of them killed him. Now, I'm declaring martial law.

867
01:14:54,737 --> 01:14:57,959
Martial law! What good do you think that will do against the Daleks?

868
01:14:58,123 --> 01:15:00,062
The Daleks will do as I tell them.

869
01:15:01,344 --> 01:15:03,159
We shall see, shan't we.

870
01:15:03,471 --> 01:15:04,429
Take them away.

871
01:15:07,626 --> 01:15:11,664
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!

872
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,455
Orders received. Exterminate all humans!

873
01:15:14,627 --> 01:15:16,941
Exterminate all humans!

874
01:15:17,123 --> 01:15:23,212
Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy!

875
01:15:23,475 --> 01:15:48,913
Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! ...

876
01:16:00,995 --> 01:16:01,724
Move on!

877
01:16:02,011 --> 01:16:02,658
The Dalek!

878
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:03,632
What about it?

879
01:16:03,815 --> 01:16:04,748
Can't you see it's armed?

880
01:16:04,976 --> 01:16:06,042
Keep moving!

881
01:16:08,316 --> 01:16:10,464
This area is restricted.

882
01:16:10,678 --> 01:16:11,722
On whose authority?

883
01:16:11,912 --> 01:16:12,772
Silence!

884
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:16,272
Repeat. This area is restricted.

885
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:22,623
Obey or you shall be exterminated.

886
01:16:22,883 --> 01:16:24,122
I thought they obeyed us?

887
01:16:24,303 --> 01:16:25,702
What do we do now, Doctor?

888
01:16:27,135 --> 01:16:28,269
This way.

889
01:16:32,315 --> 01:16:36,229
They will be exterminated.

890
01:16:36,444 --> 01:16:40,393
We've won. The revolution's over. I'll pass the word to Valmar, Kebble and the rest.

891
01:16:40,585 --> 01:16:44,032
Wait. The revolution is not quite over yet.

892
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:49,879
What more can we do? Hensell's dead, you're the new Governor. The battle's over.

893
01:16:50,086 --> 01:16:56,618
Not quite. You mentioned Kebble, Valmar and that rabble. Well now they must be dealt with.

894
01:16:57,026 --> 01:16:58,451
But those are our own men.

895
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:00,644
Huh, huh. Of course.

896
01:17:00,877 --> 01:17:02,070
I don't understand.

897
01:17:02,665 --> 01:17:19,706
Do you think I can ever be secure in that chair while that rabble are still loose? They rebelled against Hensell yesterday. Tomorrow it'll be my turn. Well, let them rebel. Tell them the guards have taken control. Let them attack, and then we can crush them, utterly!

898
01:17:21,131 --> 01:17:23,488
You say "we".

899
01:17:23,707 --> 01:17:28,274
Yes. We've come a long way together you and I. You going to back down now?

900
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,528
Couldn't you just arrest them?

901
01:17:31,757 --> 01:17:34,127
Everyone must be killed.

902
01:17:46,545 --> 01:17:47,827
Now!

903
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:50,534
What have you brought me in here for?

904
01:17:50,769 --> 01:17:51,508
Quiet!

905
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:55,413
Whose side are you on anyway?

906
01:17:55,635 --> 01:17:57,922
I thought I was going to be on the winning side.

907
01:17:58,128 --> 01:17:59,025
What changed your mind?

908
01:17:59,195 --> 01:18:03,982
Bragen. The colony's become too small for him. He wants us out of the way now.

909
01:18:04,176 --> 01:18:06,945
Yeah, well it often happens that way, mate, when you follow blokes like him.

910
01:18:07,166 --> 01:18:11,292
Look, I'm going to try and get your friends here, if I can. So wait here.

911
01:18:18,206 --> 01:18:36,529
People of Vulcan. This is your new Governor talking to you. I have to announce that Governor Hensell has been murdered by the rebels. I have taken control temporarily, until order is restored. People living on the perimeter and in the interior can stay calm. We know who the murderers are.

912
01:18:36,867 --> 01:18:43,581
I shall keep you informed of events as soon as I am able, so listen for the signal to watch your communication sets. That is all.

913
01:18:45,426 --> 01:18:46,764
Ah! There you are.

914
01:18:46,829 --> 01:18:47,612
- Ben!
- I knew you'd be all right!

915
01:18:47,785 --> 01:18:48,583
Polly - you okay?

916
01:18:48,769 --> 01:18:49,328
Oh, yes.

917
01:18:49,536 --> 01:18:50,490
Did Valmar find you, then?

918
01:18:50,644 --> 01:18:51,291
Valmar? No.

919
01:18:51,456 --> 01:18:52,921
What's this about Valmar?

920
01:18:53,138 --> 01:18:56,309
Well it seems Bragen's gone power-mad. He wants the rebels to revolt, then he can finish them off.

921
01:18:56,534 --> 01:19:00,364
The Daleks won't care who they fight. They'll exterminate every human being on this planet.

922
01:19:00,627 --> 01:19:03,348
Doctor, please let's go back to the TARDIS.

923
01:19:03,559 --> 01:19:05,169
Quinn. Keep them both here.

924
01:19:05,385 --> 01:19:06,588
Well, wait a minute, Doctor!

925
01:19:07,558 --> 01:19:08,781
All right. All right.

926
01:19:09,653 --> 01:19:14,398
Orders received. Daleks commence extermination.

927
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:19,720
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!

928
01:19:20,732 --> 01:19:22,073
Down everyone!

929
01:19:37,275 --> 01:19:38,458
Don't come any nearer.

930
01:19:38,545 --> 01:19:39,227
What do you mean?

931
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:45,980
I overheard your conversation with Bragen. But you can't stand up to the Daleks, so your plan will come to nothing.

932
01:19:46,413 --> 01:19:47,665
Not my plan - Bragen's.

933
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:48,680
But that's the same thing.

934
01:19:48,854 --> 01:19:49,483
Not any more.

935
01:19:49,665 --> 01:19:51,676
You expect me to believe that?

936
01:19:52,161 --> 01:19:59,518
I came here to do exactly what you've done. Let Bragen see what the Daleks are like. He doesn't know how strong they are.

937
01:19:59,771 --> 01:20:00,795
He's got to be stopped.

938
01:20:00,808 --> 01:20:05,967
You will lead us to the middle of your party of human beings.

939
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:06,762
Yes.

940
01:20:06,931 --> 01:20:09,584
We will fight for you.

941
01:20:11,192 --> 01:20:13,756
Believe me, Val, it's the only way to save all our lives.

942
01:20:13,955 --> 01:20:16,469
Did you know that the Daleks are duplicating?

943
01:20:16,674 --> 01:20:17,408
Yes.

944
01:20:17,573 --> 01:20:20,113
But we are your friends.

945
01:20:20,368 --> 01:20:22,531
We will serve you.

946
01:20:22,747 --> 01:20:25,982
Take us to the centre of your group.

947
01:20:26,298 --> 01:20:27,442
Can we trust them?

948
01:20:27,618 --> 01:20:33,778
We must! The guards have orders to wipe us out. We must use the Daleks. Come on.

949
01:20:44,808 --> 01:20:45,347
Doctor!

950
01:20:45,624 --> 01:20:46,510
The window. Does it open?

951
01:20:46,677 --> 01:20:47,226
I dunno.

952
01:20:47,404 --> 01:20:49,679
It had better, or we're done for! Out you go.

953
01:20:50,548 --> 01:20:52,689
Ah!... Ah!... What's happening?

954
01:20:52,925 --> 01:20:56,995
The Daleks. They're teeming all over the corridors. We've got to get back to Lesterson's lab.

955
01:21:11,304 --> 01:21:24,005
This is Governor Bragen speaking. A group of rebels is attempting to take over the colony. It is the duty of all loyal citizens to help the guards resist. Stay in your homes. Order will be restored. Listen to my bulletins.

956
01:21:24,937 --> 01:21:27,267
The rebels are using the Daleks against our people!

957
01:21:27,478 --> 01:21:31,604
Well, get back and fight! Why do you come running to me? What do you think your guns are for?

958
01:21:31,759 --> 01:21:32,862
Well, the guns don't work against them!

959
01:21:33,004 --> 01:21:33,968
Get back and fight them!

960
01:21:40,892 --> 01:21:42,062
There, and there!

961
01:21:47,046 --> 01:21:47,940
Over there!

962
01:21:48,577 --> 01:21:50,858
No! No! Over there! They're our people!

963
01:21:51,067 --> 01:21:51,764
Cut the Dalek gun off!

964
01:21:51,956 --> 01:21:55,911
No! Ah!...

965
01:21:56,705 --> 01:21:57,851
I told you to cut the gun off!

966
01:21:58,036 --> 01:21:58,572
I did!

967
01:21:59,108 --> 01:22:00,182
You've killed our own people!

968
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:02,583
We have to dismantle the gun, that's all.

969
01:22:03,963 --> 01:22:05,280
Oh, look at it.

970
01:22:07,331 --> 01:22:10,349
Your usefulness is over.

971
01:22:17,239 --> 01:22:18,010
Come on!

972
01:22:21,038 --> 01:22:22,870
Quick, Val. Come on!

973
01:22:25,704 --> 01:22:27,605
Doctor, it's stupid to hide in here!

974
01:22:27,796 --> 01:22:29,798
Well, do you fancy your chances outside in the corridor? No thanks.

975
01:22:30,018 --> 01:22:31,138
The answer must be here somewhere.

976
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:32,527
Ssssh!

977
01:22:32,891 --> 01:22:33,466
Ah!...

978
01:22:42,999 --> 01:22:50,769
You must be absolutely quiet. They know everything that's going on. Everything! They even know what you're thinking.

979
01:22:51,044 --> 01:22:52,949
Where do they get their power from, Lesterson?

980
01:22:53,152 --> 01:23:01,343
Ah, I tried to turn the power off. But they were miles ahead of me. Marvellous creatures. You have to admire them.

981
01:23:01,563 --> 01:23:03,066
But we've got to stop them!

982
01:23:03,259 --> 01:23:16,809
Oh, it's too late for that. They're the new species, you see. Taking over from homo sapiens. Man's had his day. Finished now.

983
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:29,139
The static circuit is nearly complete.

984
01:23:29,787 --> 01:23:33,708
Soon we can abandon the power we are using.

985
01:23:38,611 --> 01:23:41,952
The humans are being exterminated.

986
01:23:51,673 --> 01:23:53,873
Did you hear that? They're going to use their own power!

987
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:56,628
- No!
- Come on!

988
01:23:57,738 --> 01:23:58,707
- Don't be a fool 
- come on!

989
01:24:13,604 --> 01:24:14,539
Take it easy, Polly.

990
01:24:14,772 --> 01:24:18,491
Can't we do anything?! They're murdering everybody, one by one!

991
01:24:18,706 --> 01:24:21,320
You've done all this. Why did you give them power in the first place?

992
01:24:21,731 --> 01:24:36,513
Well, I could control it, you see. And then Janley got one of her men - Valmar, I think it was, yes - and he rigged up a secret cable. It's carrying power directly from the colony's supply.

993
01:24:37,213 --> 01:24:40,502
Where? Where is it, Lesterson?

994
01:24:40,792 --> 01:24:49,349
Valmar's the only one who can answer that. Or the Daleks of course. They know everything. Yes, you should ask the Daleks.

995
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:52,271
Then we must find Valmar.

996
01:24:52,385 --> 01:24:54,752
No! You stay here and look after Polly.

997
01:24:54,963 --> 01:24:55,861
I'll go.

998
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:32,906
You'll have to leave her now, Valmar.

999
01:25:36,242 --> 01:25:54,680
Section One? Where's your report? Are you there Section One? Section Two? Section Two? Why don't they answer? Can you hear me Section Two? Section Three? Oh, why don't they answer? I'm their Governor. Why don't they answer?

1000
01:26:40,221 --> 01:26:54,954
This is Bragen speaking. I'm speaking to the Daleks. Daleks, listen to me. I am the Governor. You must work for me. Do not trust the rebels. I will give you whatever you want. But immobilise your guns. This is the Governor speaking.

1001
01:26:56,283 --> 01:26:58,018
He's nuts, trying to talk to the Daleks.

1002
01:26:59,533 --> 01:27:01,369
Lesterson, what's in that cupboard?

1003
01:27:01,893 --> 01:27:03,459
Nothing. I think It's quite empty.

1004
01:27:03,639 --> 01:27:05,225
Well, come on, Polly, we'll be safe in there, love.

1005
01:27:05,885 --> 01:27:08,604
Do you hear me, Daleks?! You will obey my orders!

1006
01:27:08,783 --> 01:27:12,377
No use, Bragen. The Daleks have stopped obeying your orders.

1007
01:27:12,569 --> 01:27:13,746
Ah! Guards!

1008
01:27:13,991 --> 01:27:19,213
Dead! The Daleks have killed them. You still have your guard units in the interior. How long will it take them to get here?

1009
01:27:19,394 --> 01:27:20,215
That depends.

1010
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:21,574
Well, get them!

1011
01:27:21,744 --> 01:27:23,096
Well, they will be intercepted by the Daleks.

1012
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:26,572
Exactly! It will draw them away from here and give the Doctor a chance to deal with them.

1013
01:27:26,761 --> 01:27:28,901
I refuse to allow my guards to be sacrificed.

1014
01:27:29,053 --> 01:27:33,556
In that case the Daleks will destroy everything on this colony.

1015
01:27:37,003 --> 01:27:44,578
Guards. This is Bragen speaking. All units will report immediately to the capital. Be prepared to face the rebel Daleks.

1016
01:27:45,421 --> 01:27:47,186
Ben! Polly!

1017
01:27:47,558 --> 01:27:49,058
Doctor, did you hear what Bragen said?

1018
01:27:49,234 --> 01:27:50,022
Yes, I did.

1019
01:27:50,191 --> 01:27:51,873
Well I only hope the Daleks do go for the guards.

1020
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:53,987
A lot of the Daleks went out just now.

1021
01:27:54,292 --> 01:27:56,152
Good, because we're going inside. Come on Valmar. _.

1022
01:27:59,256 --> 01:28:02,803
Ben, give us that spare cable over there. Polly, keep watch at the door.

1023
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,905
Well, you know what you're doing?

1024
01:28:06,076 --> 01:28:06,815
Of course I do!

1025
01:28:06,967 --> 01:28:09,398
Well, why can't you just take all the plugs out and cut the power off?

1026
01:28:09,543 --> 01:28:11,323
Because I prefer to do it my way!

1027
01:28:11,902 --> 01:28:12,944
Look out!

1028
01:28:19,772 --> 01:28:25,918
Static power is being stored. We can dismantle the human electric system.

1029
01:28:26,174 --> 01:28:29,369
The law of the Daleks is in force.

1030
01:28:29,612 --> 01:28:31,807
Extermination of humans.

1031
01:28:34,455 --> 01:28:37,307
Our cables have been moved.

1032
01:28:38,006 --> 01:28:40,974
And I could tell you who did it!

1033
01:28:41,194 --> 01:28:43,487
What were you doing in there?

1034
01:28:43,955 --> 01:28:46,155
I want to help you.

1035
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:47,478
Why?

1036
01:28:49,322 --> 01:28:52,748
I am your servant.

1037
01:28:52,941 --> 01:28:56,052
We do not need humans now.

1038
01:28:56,289 --> 01:29:01,330
Ah, then, but you wouldn't kill me. I gave you life.

1039
01:29:01,564 --> 01:29:04,244
Yes, you gave us life.

1040
01:29:36,508 --> 01:29:48,243
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!...

1041
01:29:50,437 --> 01:29:58,747
Out of control..

1042
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:42,880
What happened to it?

1043
01:30:43,931 --> 01:30:44,940
I don't know.

1044
01:30:45,223 --> 01:30:47,884
It seems that your friend, the Examiner, was successful after all.

1045
01:30:51,165 --> 01:30:53,785
Now I shall restore law and order on this planet.

1046
01:30:53,958 --> 01:30:55,871
Not your law, Bragen. That's finished for good.

1047
01:30:56,023 --> 01:30:56,864
You'll obey me, or...

1048
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:00,012
Your day is over, Bragen. No one will obey you now.

1049
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:01,965
I'm still the Governor, and you will...

1050
01:31:03,565 --> 01:31:04,649
Valmar.

1051
01:31:10,407 --> 01:31:11,789
He was a murderer.

1052
01:31:13,141 --> 01:31:14,227
Enough of guns.

1053
01:31:14,625 --> 01:31:21,160
There's a lot of clearing up to be done. We will rebuild together. What is the extent of the damage?

1054
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,025
Oh, I don't know if its repairable. The whole electrical system.

1055
01:31:26,556 --> 01:31:27,611
Are you all right?

1056
01:31:27,769 --> 01:31:29,224
Oh, he's OK. The clot knocked himself out.

1057
01:31:29,563 --> 01:31:31,390
It's a miracle. How did you do it?

1058
01:31:31,587 --> 01:31:32,615
Eh? What happened?

1059
01:31:33,586 --> 01:31:35,385
You destroyed the Daleks, that's what you did!

1060
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:39,090
Did I do that?

1061
01:31:39,289 --> 01:31:40,124
You know you did!

1062
01:31:40,299 --> 01:31:47,220
You used the power from the colony's electric supply - overfed it - and blew up their temporary static circuit. Well didn't you?

1063
01:31:48,309 --> 01:31:49,521
Did I do all that?

1064
01:31:49,803 --> 01:31:54,402
You may have stopped the Daleks, but have you any idea of the damage you've done to the colony?

1065
01:31:55,113 --> 01:31:56,487
Oh. There was a blow back, was there?

1066
01:31:56,683 --> 01:32:01,926
A blow back? Our power supply has been destroyed! It'll be months before we can get things back to normal.

1067
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:02,781
Valmar!

1068
01:32:02,949 --> 01:32:03,758
That is unfortunate.

1069
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:05,606
But did it have to be this way?

1070
01:32:05,798 --> 01:32:07,176
I did a lot of damage, did I?

1071
01:32:07,554 --> 01:32:08,434
Come on.

1072
01:32:11,781 --> 01:32:16,419
I think we'd better get out of here before they send us the bill.

1073
01:32:25,753 --> 01:32:30,350
Oh, you needn't worry about them anymore, Doctor. Just a heap of old iron now.
