1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,005
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:46,098
I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant.

3
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:50,318
So Lesterson, they're even capable of speech!

4
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,670
Yes. But then, why not? After all, they have a certain intelligence.

5
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:56,735
Yes I know, but...

6
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,541
But is... is it... it is... an intelligence that we can control.

7
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:03,922
So what you want is permission to continue your experiments?

8
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:08,900
Governor, think what it would mean if we were to set it to work in the mines. It could double our production overnight!

9
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,095
Consider the effects it could have on our whole economy.

10
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:22,457
Yes, and the effect of that on Earth... Yes. Yes, they could be very grateful.

11
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:26,278
I shall stop you. I will!

12
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,905
All right Lesterson, permission granted.

13
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:32,255
Permission? Permission for what?

14
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:34,261
To continue my work, Examiner.

15
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:39,193
But... But didn't you all hear what I said? The Daleks must be destroyed!

16
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,995
Ho, ho. Never!

17
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:45,597
Very well. If not by my order - then by Earth's! Come Ben, Polly.

18
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:52,752
Ah, Examiner. Just a moment. Tell me, why are you so against this project?

19
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:57,946
But I've told you! I realise I can't give you any proof, but you've no idea of the danger!

20
00:01:58,126 --> 00:01:58,733
No.

21
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:06,479
Yes. Danger! I shall be contacting Earth just as soon as radio communications have been restored.

22
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:11,483
You're my servant, are you?

23
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:13,186
I... I am.

24
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:29,070
Very well. Immobilise yourself. Go on. I order it! Immediately!

25
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:37,620
Huh!

26
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,027
Lesterson.

27
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,826
Why did you stop obeying? You were given an order.

28
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,050
He has gone.

29
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:50,898
Then you obey only...

30
00:02:51,097 --> 00:03:05,556
His order was wrong. I cannot serve human beings if I am immobilised. You gave me power. Your orders are right. I serve you.

31
00:03:06,482 --> 00:03:13,809
Lesterson. Lesterson, it reasons. Just how limited is its intelligence?

32
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:24,994
Now, there is no cause for... for concern, Governor. Just you wait until you see the amount of work it can do! And now, I'm really going to put you through your paces. Follow me, Dalek.

33
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:27,255
I obey.

34
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,100
That's it!

35
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:42,311
We should have stayed with Quinn.

36
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:45,704
Well, we couldn't have helped him Polly, even if we'd wanted to. The Governor's already reached his verdict.

37
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:46,539
Wire. Scissors. Tape.

38
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:49,300
But he didn't murder the real Examiner. I'm sure he didn't.

39
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:55,832
Oh, well. The way I see it this lot's too busy arguing amongst themselves to do much about anything. Anyway, first things first. The Daleks are the important thing!

40
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:58,397
Ah! Congratulations, Ben!

41
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:00,100
What'd I do? What'd I do?

42
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,629
You just used your brains, that's what you did. The Daleks are the most important thing!

43
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,315
I still think Quinn's innocent.

44
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:09,675
How can I be in league with the rebels?

45
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:10,540
The evidence confirms it.

46
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,141
It was I that warned of their dangers.

47
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:13,250
As part of your overall plan!

48
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:14,777
You wouldn't even take the matter seriously.

49
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:16,446
If I was wrong then, I have a chance to rectify it now!

50
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:20,497
If that's going to be your attitude, I suggest that we...

51
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:27,709
Quinn! Let us conduct this inquiry in an orderly manner. Now, the Examiner was attacked, there can be no question of that.

52
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,516
And the button grabbed by the Examiner was missing from your suit.

53
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:33,198
Yes, if you've got anything to add to that, you'd better say it now.

54
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,691
I didn't attack the man. I had no reason to. I was the one that sent for him!

55
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:40,521
You sent for him?!

56
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:45,816
It was necessary. Under the circumstances, I'd hardly be likely to sabotage the radio communications.

57
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:48,340
But... but why Quinn? Why?

58
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:49,825
Because of the rebels!

59
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:52,552
The rebels! They're nothing more than one or two fanatics.

60
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:53,756
You know as well as I do that they...

61
00:04:54,014 --> 00:04:57,972
Unless you're trying to create trouble here - to undermine the Governor's position.

62
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:01,566
Bragen, you'd better explain that.

63
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:08,980
If you're removed, who takes your place? The Deputy Governor, of course. And that's the real reason behind all this trouble, isn't it Quinn?

64
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:09,826
Go on.

65
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:15,613
You attack the Examiner in the mercury swamp and blame it on the rebels. Then you sabotage the radio - blame that on the rebels too.

66
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:18,152
Get him out of my sight!

67
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:21,264
Hensell, before you listen to these preposterous allegations...

68
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:34,767
I chose Quinn myself. I trained him for the job. Why, in a few years time, he'd have had this seat!

69
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:38,127
Sometimes Governor, a few years is a long time to wait.

70
00:05:42,278 --> 00:05:43,197
Oh, Bragen?

71
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:44,331
Governor?

72
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:51,973
You will assume Quinn's duties. As of now, you are Deputy Governor.

73
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,813
Ah!

74
00:06:00,515 --> 00:06:02,197
I hope you know what you're doing!

75
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:04,128
So do I!

76
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,158
Excellent. excellent.

77
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,267
But I thought we were after the Daleks, not this control unit you've nicked!

78
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:26,378
If only we could find a... Ah, yes!

79
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:32,627
He's a right little delinquent, isn't he?

80
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:35,157
Doctor, what on Earth are you up to?

81
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:36,923
Ooh!

82
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,426
Ah! Now we're really getting somewhere!

83
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,881
Look Doctor, I don't want to appear dim, but how's this going to do the Daleks in?

84
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,897
They think that Lesterson's the driving force, but I don't. The Daleks are using him.

85
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:52,131
But how?

86
00:06:52,372 --> 00:07:01,413
Problem. Smash the Daleks, and the people here will lock us up or kill us. Let the Daleks go, and we'll all be exterminated.

87
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:05,144
We could just go back to the TARDIS. At least we'd be safe to think there.

88
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:07,089
Oh yes, that's coming on.

89
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:10,056
Oh, you talk to him, will you?

90
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:13,204
Doctor look, if you told us what you were up to, perhaps we could help you.

91
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:23,849
Mustn't underestimate any of them. Lesterson's a first class scientist, first class. He opened the capsule. He realised that the Daleks could be reactivated.

92
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:31,947
Yeah, that could be the answer. Let's kidnap Lesterson, and hide him away for a bit. Well, it would stop him bringing the Daleks back to life, wouldn't it?

93
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:34,961
I thought it was pretty bright.

94
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:36,334
There we are.

95
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:37,991
What is it?

96
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,871
What is it? It could be the answer to all our problems.

97
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,678
Ah Examiner, don't let them fool you about the rebels. They're strong.

98
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,832
Try and find out where they hold their meetings.

99
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:58,130
Leave him alone!

100
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:01,011
It's all right, Polly.

101
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,004
We'll help him Polly, but later.

102
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:01,983
Yes but...

103
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:09,579
Now, this is a case where a little injustice is better than wholesale slaughter. What we want is in Lesterson's laboratory. Come along.

104
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:16,722
Incredible! Well, let's move on to test fourteen.

105
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:18,709
I am ready.

106
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:24,216
When sodium acts on ethyl alcohol, what is the resulting derivative?

107
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:30,719
Sodium ethoxide. C2 H5 ONA.

108
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:35,566
Just five seconds, Janley! Just the time it took to speak the answer.

109
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,594
Right too.

110
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:48,523
But of course it's right! Look, can you imagine what kind of positronic brain this robot has, Janley? Think of the store of knowledge that it must carry. Sulphuric acid.

111
00:08:48,882 --> 00:08:51,187
H2 SO4.

112
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:53,202
Ah, you see?

113
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:54,595
May I come in?

114
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:55,783
What do you want?

115
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:58,351
Oh, ah, just to see how you're getting on.

116
00:08:58,693 --> 00:08:59,295
If you think...

117
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:04,203
No, please! I'm... I'm not here to cause trouble. I... I'm just interested, that's all.

118
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:07,162
You've done nothing but meddle and interfere ever since you landed on Vulcan.

119
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:13,507
Well, I... I did give you permission to open up the capsule, now didn't I? Please, carry on.

120
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:16,077
And you won't try to stop me?

121
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:26,499
Stop you? No, of course not. We get off on the wrong foot, Lesterson, but... but I'm a reasonable man and... and I've been thinking, perhaps I was hasty.

122
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:29,917
Well, if you... if you... if you really want to call a truce.

123
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:33,424
A truce? My dear fellow, I... I'd like to be friends!

124
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:37,869
Yes. Yes. Very well, you may stay.

125
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:44,761
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Perhaps you'd like to amuse yourselves for a little while.

126
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:51,899
Laboratory. Yes.

127
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,711
All right, I can come now. Right.

128
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,855
I just have to slip out for a few minutes, Lesterson, alright?

129
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,501
Ah, yes, yes. Um, very well then. Examiner, shall we test its knowledge of physics?

130
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,851
Oh, oh, splendid, splendid. Ah, huh, please, please, carry on.

131
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:19,951
Thank you. D... what is the First Law of Thermodynamics?

132
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:44,402
When heat is transformed into any other kind of energy or vice versa, the total quantity of energy remains invariable. That is to say, the quantity of heat which disappears is equivalent to the quantity of other kind of energy produced...

133
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,370
Fool! What do you think you're doing?

134
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:48,709
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!...

135
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:50,535
I'm saving your life!

136
00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:52,708
Get out! Get out!

137
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:57,191
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... I have, ah, sustained no damage.

138
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:06,525
It's all right to _?

139
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,175
You were able to get away then?

140
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:13,209
Yes. Lesterson's with the Examiner. And Hensell?

141
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,291
At a meeting of production managers. He left me in control.

142
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:19,209
We could take over the colony now.

143
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:26,004
No. No it has to be absolutely right. I don't want to take over a colony full of rebels do I, Janley?

144
00:11:26,244 --> 00:11:28,672
Well, I don't know. You're making me help them.

145
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:39,726
Only to stir them up to create enough trouble to get rid of Hensell, and then... and then we crush them. The whole colony will be grateful, and I'll be Governor.

146
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:43,614
Is that the gun you told me of?

147
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:46,419
Can you persuade the rebels this will help them?

148
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:49,620
Yes, Valmar thinks he can work in a switch to turn it on and off.

149
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:51,012
How powerful is it?

150
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:58,161
It killed Resno, Lesterson's assistant, and Lesterson believes that Resno's simply shaken up - taking a few days off.

151
00:11:58,522 --> 00:11:59,347
And the body?

152
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:12,841
In the mercury swamp. Lesterson was the indirect cause of Resno's death. It's a good hold over him if he makes trouble. I'll give this to Valmar then?

153
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:14,278
Yes.

154
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:15,820
When do we move?

155
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:19,852
I need another card in my hand. The Examiner bothers me.

156
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:21,590
I thought Quinn was the danger.

157
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:28,425
Uh, not any more. The Examiner is no fool. No, there has to be something else.

158
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:34,325
Well?

159
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:36,922
Well, he's not in the laboratory, Lesterson's by himself.

160
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,639
Hmm. He must have gone another way. Can I leave it you? I'm going to go back to the rest room.

161
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:41,530
Well, but...

162
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,141
Well, somebody's got to clear it up.

163
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:44,056
Okay.

164
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,485
Hello there.

165
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:55,450
Hello. Um, you're Lesterson's assistant aren't you?

166
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:57,856
Yes. You're not looking for the Examiner are you?

167
00:12:58,238 --> 00:12:59,643
Well, do you know where he is?

168
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:03,257
Yes, he's waiting to get a message through from Earth. He's in the Communications Room.

169
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:04,581
Umm...

170
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,256
Oh, you'll find it easy enough. Look. Around, then to your right, in the next block.

171
00:13:09,514 --> 00:13:10,216
Thanks very much.

172
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:21,909
Doctor? Anyone here?

173
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:33,950
Well done Valmar. Hold her. Hold her.

174
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,756
There, that'll keep her quiet for a bit.

175
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:42,272
I've no idea who she is. She was just snooping around.

176
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:46,329
I sent her. We want her kept out of the way. Get a couple of your men to keep her in a safe place.

177
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:49,348
Now, this is what I told you about.

178
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:53,336
Yes. The lethal power must come from here.

179
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,341
Uh, huh.

180
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:56,124
It should have quite a good range.

181
00:13:56,374 --> 00:13:57,444
Can you fix it?

182
00:13:57,678 --> 00:14:01,255
It's easy. This could win us the revolution.

183
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:02,414
Ahh...

184
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:24,810
She said she was coming back here. She knew the way, and she wouldn't have wandered off. I know she wouldn't! Oh!

185
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:30,818
Ben, if you were a Dalek what would be your next move?

186
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,629
I'm talking about Polly.

187
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:35,583
Oh, no, no, no, no. She's a clever girl, but she couldn't answer this.

188
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:36,956
But she is missing!

189
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:38,283
Oh, no, no, no.

190
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:39,754
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!

191
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:46,112
No, no, no! She's looking around, there's a lot to see in the colony. She's interested. I like that.

192
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:49,939
Come on.

193
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,231
Where are we going?

194
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:53,987
To report it. If we make a fool of ourselves, I don't care! We report it!

195
00:14:56,971 --> 00:15:07,210
Yes, yes, yes. I managed to stop that fool of an Examiner just in time. You know there are some people here who believe that you're an enemy.

196
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,393
I am your servant.

197
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:18,471
What does this machine do?

198
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,936
You know, it's amazing. You have an almost human interest and curiosity.

199
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:33,853
A Dalek is bet... is not the same as a human. If I am to help, I must know everything.

200
00:15:34,227 --> 00:15:35,384
Yes. Yes, of course.

201
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:37,467
What is this machine?

202
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:41,074
It computes meteorite storms as they approach our weather satellites.

203
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:43,314
How accurate is it?

204
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:48,685
About, ah, seventy percent. It helps to cut down on our satellite losses.

205
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:54,702
Daleks can build pu... computers with one hundred percent accuracy.

206
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:56,470
One hundred percent?

207
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:03,770
If you provide materials and our own power unit, a computer will be built.

208
00:16:04,222 --> 00:16:08,803
A hundred percent. That would be an enormous saving for the... for the colony!

209
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:11,529
Then, you will get the materials?

210
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:13,380
I'll go and speak to the Governor at once.

211
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:18,847
I will be ready to dictate the blueprint when you return.

212
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:22,467
Huh, huh. Oh, that's marvellous!

213
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:57,855
You agreed we'd go and see Bragen.

214
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,293
Hmm? Power.

215
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:01,356
Come on then!

216
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:04,325
Now the energy intake for Daleks should be the cube...

217
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:07,599
Now then...

218
00:17:08,056 --> 00:17:09,615
Well, now what are you at?

219
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:12,454
Talk to yourself.

220
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:15,452
Oh, it's useless with incomplete data!

221
00:17:24,536 --> 00:17:25,428
Lesterson!

222
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:26,075
Eh?

223
00:17:26,324 --> 00:17:29,454
He just went past. That means we can get into his laboratory again.

224
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:30,518
But we're looking for...

225
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:32,371
Oh, come along, Ben. Come along.

226
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:40,822
There's somebody in there.

227
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:44,350
What are you doing here?

228
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,203
Stand aside. Servants shouldn't question.

229
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:51,366
Entry is restricted.

230
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,845
Not for me it isn't. "Accord every access". I've got a badge.

231
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:56,356
That is an order.

232
00:17:56,631 --> 00:17:59,851
A Dalek order. Short circuit the generator, Ben.

233
00:18:00,228 --> 00:18:05,729
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Stand back!

234
00:18:05,957 --> 00:18:09,875
Don't be frightened of it Ben. It's not armed. I'm going to see what it was doing in there.

235
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:24,087
Ben, let's get out of here!

236
00:18:25,114 --> 00:18:27,077
Fool. Lesterson must have reactivated them.

237
00:18:27,285 --> 00:18:33,241
Yes. When I say run, run like a rabbit. Run!

238
00:18:38,853 --> 00:18:45,261
I have sent the human being for materials.

239
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:46,616
And power?

240
00:18:47,012 --> 00:18:54,709
Yes. Power we can turn into static, then we will conquer.

241
00:18:55,033 --> 00:19:03,125
We will conquer... We will conquer... We will conquer...

242
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,350
But if you didn't do it Lesterson, then the Dalek must have used your power supply and reactivated the others itself.

243
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,271
I was going to do that anyway.

244
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:12,786
Are you off your head, mate? Those two are armed!

245
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:17,656
Then we turn off the electricity, disarm them, and then everything is safe again.

246
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:19,106
I've already explained to you.

247
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:26,792
Stop these arguments, both of you. I've had enough. I've every confidence in Lesterson. He has carte blanche for the Daleks from now on.

248
00:19:26,986 --> 00:19:28,683
But they must be destroyed!

249
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:35,416
Bragen, I'm making a tour of the perimeter. I put you in direct charge here. See that Lesterson gets everything he wants, will you?

250
00:19:36,312 --> 00:19:40,604
I shall need a permanent guard on my laboratory, Bragen.

251
00:19:43,177 --> 00:19:47,387
Don't worry about the Examiner. I think I can keep him quiet.

252
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,211
We've been forgetting about Polly.

253
00:19:54,489 --> 00:20:01,316
Greed and ambition, that's all it is. Wait till they find out what their precious production figures have cost them!

254
00:20:02,351 --> 00:20:03,545
Oh, I want to see you.

255
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:05,640
What about?

256
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:07,907
Well it's Polly, she's missing. We can't find her anywhere.

257
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:11,870
I'll tell one of my men to make enquiries. It shouldn't take long to find her.

258
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:13,024
Ah, thanks.

259
00:20:13,974 --> 00:20:23,861
Examiner, some of my men have found a body in the mercury swamp. It was the body of a middle-aged man.

260
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,851
What is that to do with me?

261
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:29,577
You're the Examiner - or maybe you're not.

262
00:20:36,343 --> 00:20:38,340
Just exactly what do you mean by that?

263
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:41,987
Who are you? Quinn's friends? Come to stir up rebellion?

264
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:46,231
There's only one possible way that you could know I'm not the Examiner.

265
00:20:46,731 --> 00:20:49,426
Yeah, by knowing what the real Examiner looked like!

266
00:20:49,768 --> 00:20:58,294
Exactly, Ben. Exactly! Only two people knew of his arrival on this planet. Myself and his murderer.

267
00:20:58,621 --> 00:20:59,624
That's enough!

268
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:02,204
Is it? Doctor, we've got to tell the Governor.

269
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:08,899
Do you think he'll believe you? I'll soon convince him that you murdered the man yourself. You stole the Examiner's badge.

270
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:16,477
Then why don't you arrest us? Because there's a doubt isn't there? Because it might, it just might, go against you.

271
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:24,553
All right, all right, so neither of us wants to make a move. But you leave Lesterson alone - and the Daleks!

272
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,256
He'd make a right Father Christmas, wouldn't he?

273
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:37,302
Oh, I'd rather fight a hundred of his sort than just one Dalek.

274
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,942
Listen to this. "The girl is safe. She will remain so as long as you leave the Daleks alone".

275
00:21:57,861 --> 00:21:59,985
And did you disarm the other two?

276
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:06,636
Yes. We are your servants. We do not need guns.

277
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,645
I'm very glad. I knew the Examiner was wrong about you.

278
00:22:10,987 --> 00:22:13,035
Did you get our materials?

279
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:15,851
Yes. Everything you need you can have.

280
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,448
And a power plant?

281
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:19,607
Everything.

282
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:32,322
We will get our power.

283
00:22:32,756 --> 00:22:42,023
We will get our power. We will get our power. We will get our power. We will...
