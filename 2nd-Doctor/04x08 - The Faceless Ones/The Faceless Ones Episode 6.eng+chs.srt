1
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:05,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:34,896
我们现在怎么办?
What do we do now?

3
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,416
我们溜出去, 看看能不能找到其他的年轻人. 快来
We slip away and see if we can find
all these young people. Come on.

4
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,656
啊, Blade 机长, 我们正在按你的指示
Ah, Captain Blade, we're following your instructions,

5
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:47,088
寻找住宿中心呢
We're looking for the accommodation centre.

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,552
我的指示对你们不适用
My instructions don't apply to you.

7
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,216
你俩不再需要住的地方了
You two won't be needing living space.

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,744
Blade 机长, 这是什么?
Captain Blade, what is this?

9
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:04,656
我搞不懂了, 我们是要留在这里的, 对吧?
I don't understand. We're here to stay, aren't we?

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,048
是的, 你们要留在这里, 不过不是以现在的形态
Oh yes, you're here to stay - but not in your present state.

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,730
很是抱歉, 但我还是没搞懂你的意思
I'm very sorry, I simply don't understand what you mean.

12
00:01:10,848 --> 00:01:14,800
我跟医疗中心核对过了, 你俩都是人类
I checked with the Medical Centre. You're both human.

13
00:01:16,448 --> 00:01:20,608
我们期望你们是完好无损的, 所以放你们过来了
We want you intact. That's why I allowed
you to come here.

14
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,608
我要你们的脑子
I want your brain.

15
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,360
我跟你说过了, 我不知道他们在哪里
I've told you, I don't know where they are.

16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,088
你在我这里纯粹是浪费时间
You're wasting your time with me.

17
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:37,360
我觉得他说的是实话
I think he's telling the truth.

18
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:39,680
恐怕是这样, 带他出去!
I'm afraid he is. Get him out of here!

19
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,048
他们肯定在这里某个地方
They must be here somewhere.

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,016
这个地方我们都搜遍了
We have completely searched this area.

21
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,040
我现在已经安排了50个人搜这一片
I've now got fifty men going through this part

22
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,090
伦敦警察厅也正派人来帮忙
and the Metropolitan Police are sending help.

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,536
但时间已经不多了, 还必须搜遍整个机场
But time is running short.
I have to cover the entire airfield.

24
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,980
我现在需要志愿者!
I need volunteers now!

25
00:01:58,128 --> 00:01:59,952
给我接广播室
Get me the public address room.

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,280
Heslington, 让所有入岗航班改道
Heslington, divert all in-bound aircraft.

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,000
广播室, 这里是总指挥
Public Address Room, this is the Commandant.

28
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:07,688
把我切到广播系统
Switch me through to the P.A. system

29
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,320
并且在收到下一步指示前, 暂停所有其它广播
and stop all other announcements until further instructions.

30
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,720
我是机场总指挥
This is the Airport Commandant speaking...

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,888
请大家注意
Please pay attention.

32
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:24,192
我要所有机场人员协助执行一项特别任务
I want all available Airport personnel
to assist in a special duty.

33
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,072
请各位到机场警局报告, 他们会给出具体指示
Will they please report to the Airport Police,
who will issue instructions.

34
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:33,456
同时我也向各位乘客保证, 没有必要惊慌
I would like to assure passengers
that there's no cause for alarm,

35
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,980
并且很抱歉地通知大家, 所有出港航班暂停起飞
and to apologise for the temporary suspension
of all outward flights.

36
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,000
噢
Oh.

37
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,224
你想在这里达到什么目的呢?
What did you hope to achieve here?

38
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:37,312
求你给个机会, 为了五万年轻人的性命
A chance to plead with you
for the lives of fifty thousand young people.

39
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,656
他们只不过是人类
They're only human beings.

40
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,240
那你们是什么?
And what are you?

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,416
我们是宇宙中最智慧的种族
We are the most intelligent race in the universe.

42
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,904
- 总管?   - 什么事?
- Director?  - Yes?

43
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
夫里堡的航班刚刚起飞了
Freiburg flight has just taken off.

44
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,776
为什么, Jamie!
Why, Jamie!

45
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:49,840
- 你想同我说话?   - 噢不想, 当然不想
- You wish to speak to me?  - Oh no, of course

46
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,912
你...你不是 Jamie, 你是个变色龙
It's... it's not Jamie. You're a Chameleon.

47
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,560
不过, 我觉得你扮他扮得并不好
Well, I don't think you've done a very good job on him.

48
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,080
- 怎么不好?   - 在转换过程中你丢掉了他的苏格兰口音
- Why not?
- Well you lost his Scots accent in the processing.

49
00:03:58,128 --> 00:03:59,408
我还是更喜欢原装的
Oh I much preferred the original.

50
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:03,104
博士, 如果你是在找你朋友的原身, 在这里是找不到的
If you're looking for your friend's original,
Doctor, you won't find it in here.

51
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:04,400
- 真的吗?   - 找不到, 它在...
- Really?  - No, it's...

52
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,448
...一个安全的地方
...in a safe place.

53
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:08,928
离这里并不远. 我们还等什么呢?
Not far from here. What are we waiting for?

54
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:12,176
杜布罗夫尼克和雅典, 我们的人还在等着去接
Dubrovnik and Athens.
They're waiting to collect our personnel.

55
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,176
我们比计划提前了好多, 可以等
We're well ahead of schedule. We can wait.

56
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:16,448
继续, 开始转化
Proceed with the processing.

57
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:20,208
对了, Blade 队长, 恭喜你把这个人带到这里来了
By the way, Captain Blade,
congratulations on bringing this man here.

58
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,552
我将亲自决断我们中谁将获得他的身份
I personally will decide which of our people
is to have his identity.

59
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:26,496
肯定是你的朋友中的某位, 毫无疑问
It'll be one of your friends, I've no doubt!

60
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,720
这是可以理解的...
Well it's understandable.

61
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,920
留在上面的这些特殊的人会有更多的安全感
The special people up here feel more secure

62
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,520
因为他们的原身就在卫星里面
if their originals are actually in the satellite.

63
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:36,752
- 闭嘴  - 总管没有什么需要担心的
- Be quiet.  - The Director has nothing to worry about

64
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:40,800
因为他的原身, Crossland 督察, 的确就在卫星上
because his original, Detective Inspector
Crossland is actually on board.

65
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,032
但是, 你的原身在哪里呢?
But, where's your original?

66
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,480
还有你的?
And where's yours?

67
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,296
够了! 他们的原身都非常安全
That's enough! Their originals are perfectly safe.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,600
藏在盖特威克机场一个地方, 他们永远找不到
Hidden on Gatwick Airport, where they will never be found.

69
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,616
你说我们的原身是什么意思?
What did you mean about our originals?

70
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:14,680
哦, 据我的观察, 你们分两类
Well, as I see it, there are two categories.

71
00:05:14,944 --> 00:05:18,272
一类是跟你们总管和那边那个人一样...
People like your Director and that man over there...

72
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,800
....原身就在这里, 很安全
..whose originals are safe on board here.

73
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,432
另一类就是跟你们俩一样
And then there are people like you two,

74
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,728
原身被留在盖特威克机场
whose originals have been left behind at Gatwick airport.

75
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,488
如果原身被搞坏了...你们就完蛋了!
If they're tampered with... you're finished!

76
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,488
他在撒谎
He's lying.

77
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,570
快点, 赶在总管回来之前, 把他装进机器里去
Come on, let's get him into the machine
before the Director returns.

78
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,360
好, 你最好快点把我转化掉
Yes, you'd better process me quickly,

79
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,240
要不然你俩随时都会不存在了
because any minute now you'll cease to exist.

80
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,530
你是名单上的第一个!
You're first on the list!

81
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:44,048
- 什么名单?   - 噢你肯定懂的!
- What list?  - Oh surely you understand!

82
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,920
我们已经找到所有的原身了
We've found all of the originals.

83
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,800
机场总指挥将会一个个把他们逆转换回去
The Commandant at the Airport is going to
deprocess them one by one,

84
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,990
你是第一个, 除非我阻止他
starting with you, unless I stop him.

85
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,400
- 他在唬我们  - 等等!
- He's bluffing.  - Wait!

86
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:59,440
- 你们在哪里找到原身的?   - 啊, 这我可不能告诉你
- Where did you find the originals?
- Ah, that I can't tell you.

87
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,696
但他们已经搜了一段时间
But they'd been searching for some time

88
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,496
而在我正要上飞机的时候, 我收到了信号
and just as I was about to board the aircraft
I got a signal,

89
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,416
那就意味着他们已经成功了
which meant that they'd been successful.

90
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:08,840
否则我也不会上来的
Otherwise I wouldn't have come.

91
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,064
如果你不信我, 找盖特威克机场核实一下
Well, if you don't believe me, check with Gatwick Airport.

92
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:14,200
我估计你知道它的无线电频率吧
I imagine you know its radio frequency?

93
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,544
联系盖特威克机场塔台
Contact Gatwick Air Control.

94
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,802
我已经派了两打人赶过来
I've got two dozen men moving down here

95
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,320
搜索任何有被动过的痕迹的地方
looking for any signs of the soil having been disturbed.

96
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,208
这里有二十个人, 还有五十个志愿者在排查这些机库
There are twenty men here, with fifty volunteers
going through these hangars.

97
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:35,440
- 总指挥  - 什么事?
- Commandant.  - Yes?

98
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:36,944
有人在呼叫我们的频率
Someone's crashing our frequency.

99
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:38,256
- 是谁?   - 我不知道, 先生
- Who is it?  - I don't know sir.

100
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:40,688
是一个不明身份的电台, 要求同你通话
It's an unidentified station, asking for you.

101
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,952
变色龙总部呼叫盖特威克机场
This is Chameleon Headquarters calling Gatwick Airport.

102
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:45,800
你能听清吗?
How do you read me?

103
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,456
我是盖特威克机场总指挥
This is Gatwick Airport, Commandant speaking.

104
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:53,500
我们可以清晰地听到
We are reading you loud and clear.

105
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,152
据我们所知, 你们找到了一些我们感兴趣的东西
We understand you have found some property
in which we have an interest.

106
00:06:57,344 --> 00:07:01,400
- 是这样吗?  - 是的, 我们有那个东西
- Will you confirm? - Yes, we have that property.

107
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,104
- 说明你找到它的地点  - 这有关系吗?
- State where you found it.  - Does that matter?

108
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:09,472
重要的是我们找到它了, 现在可以毁灭你们了
The important thing is we have found it,
and can now destroy you.

109
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:11,680
请在听筒旁等待
Please stay by your receiver.

110
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:14,384
博士肯定在跟他们使诈
The Doctor must be trying some sort of bluff.

111
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:16,384
但我们却帮不上多少忙
And we are not being much help to him.

112
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,360
- 你把它们放在哪里了?  - 不知道, 就在这里某个地方
- Where d'you think you left them?
- I don't know, I left them in here somewhere.

113
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:30,944
不管怎样, 不会是变色龙的人拿走了, 因为他们都已经走了
Anyway, none of that Chameleon lot could
have nicked them, 'cos they've all gone.

114
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,940
在这儿, 看!
Here, look!

115
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,440
对了, 我突然想到了
Yeah. You see it suddenly dawned on me -

116
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:36,220
他们这里这么多车厢是在做什么呢?
what would they be doing with so many coaches?

117
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:37,376
我怎么没想到?
Why didn't that occur to me?

118
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,952
噢, 你一个人不可能有所有伦敦人的脑子啊
Oh, you haven't got all the brains in London you know.

119
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,580
25个!
Twenty-five!

120
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,120
你看哈, 25辆车, 25个人!
There you are, twenty-five car numbers, twenty-five people!

121
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,048
这里是变色龙总部
This is Chameleon Headquarters.

122
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,680
解释一下你们为什么不愿意说明是在哪里找到那个东西的?
Explain your reluctance to state
where you found the property.

123
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,380
不是不愿意的问题
It is not a question of reluctance.

124
00:07:56,992 --> 00:07:59,136
就说警察还没告诉你
Say the police haven't told you yet.

125
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,648
那个东西在警察手中
The property is in the hands of the police,

126
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:04,680
他们还没有告诉我之前是藏在哪里的
who have not yet informed me where the hiding place was.

127
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:08,448
懂了, 请在听筒前等候
Message understood. Please stay by your receiver.

128
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,368
我来接
I'll get that.

129
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,472
航空控制塔台. 请等一下
Air Traffic Control. Hold on a minute.

130
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,344
是那个女孩和你的助理, 她们觉得找到了一个线索
It's the girl and your assistant.
They think they've got a clue.

131
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:21,936
好, 我尽力拖住他们
Right, I'll try and stall them.

132
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:26,224
变色龙总部呼叫盖特威克机场, 我们现在开始返回
Chameleon Headquarters to Gatwick Airport.
We are closing down now.

133
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:30,288
盖特威克机场呼叫变色龙总部, 你们能收到吗?
Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Headquarters,
are you receiving me?

134
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,432
盖特威克机场呼叫变色龙总部, 你们能收到吗?
Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Headquarters,
are you receiving me?

135
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,192
- 盖特威克机场呼叫变色龙总部...  - 关掉
- Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Headquarters...
- Turn it off.

136
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:41,152
把枪收起来
Put that gun away.

137
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,720
- 他说他们已经找到了我们的原身  - 那他找到了?
- He said he'd found our originals.  - And had he?

138
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:49,152
不, 他在虚张声势
No, he was bluffing.

139
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,896
继续转化吧
Proceed with the processing.

140
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,072
以后, 你只能听我的命令
In future, take your orders only from me.

141
00:08:57,696 --> 00:09:00,976
你们会大吃一惊的, 等会儿你们就有25个人灰飞烟灭!
You're going to get a surprise
when twenty-five of your people disintegrate!

142
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,768
好可惜啊, 你看不到了
What a pity you won't be able to see it.

143
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:03,936
护士
The Nurse.

144
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,264
现在看看...你想让我做点什么?
Now then, now... what is it you want me to do?

145
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,816
- 坐下  - 告诉我...
- Sit down.  - Tell me...

146
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,680
在我被转化的过程中, 如果你解体了, 会怎么样?
what happens if ah, you disintegrate
in the middle of my being processed?

147
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,880
我的意思是, 会对我造成什么伤害不?
I mean, will that do me any harm,

148
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:20,480
比如说, 会不会卡在某个状态与另一个之间之类的
being suspended between one thing and an other,
so to speak...

149
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:21,760
坐下!
Sit down!

150
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,280
噢, 天
Oh dear.

151
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:27,952
你应该盯着他的
You should have been watching him.

152
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:30,752
重新取一个设备
Send for a new unit.

153
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:37,072
你避免不了你的命运, 只不过推迟了一点
You haven't averted your fate, only postponed it.

154
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:01,136
终于来了, 博士....
At last. Now Doctor...

155
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,040
你能肯定现在很安全了?
You're quite sure it's safe now?

156
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,540
一切都就绪了吗?
Is everything ready now?

157
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:26,816
等一下, 长官
Just one moment, sir.

158
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:30,112
总管, 盖特威克机场又在呼叫我们了
Director. Gatwick Control calling us again.

159
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,536
- 别理他们  - 他们宣称已经找到了原身了
- Ignore them.  - They claim they have found the originals.

160
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,016
他们还是在使诈, 我说了别理他们!
They're bluffing again, I said ignore them!

161
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,664
盖特威克机场呼叫变色龙总部, 你能听到吗?
Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Head Quarters. Do you read me?

162
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,940
还是没用, 先生
It's no good sir.

163
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:52,144
那好, 我们得给他们个下马威
Very well. We'll have to give them a demonstration.

164
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,632
好了, 警司
Right Super.

165
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:55,520
Erskine 警长吗?
Sergeant Erskine?

166
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,200
他们已经找到了! 并不是在使诈
They have found them! They weren't bluffing.

167
00:12:21,776 --> 00:12:23,344
可能是他的设备出错了
His equipment could have gone wrong.

168
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:26,256
那好, 设备可能出什么错?
All right, what could have gone wrong with it?

169
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,840
这个问题得问我们的科学家
That is a question for our scientists.

170
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,960
等他们告诉你设备完全没问题的时候
By the time they tell you
that there's nothing wrong with it,

171
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,080
你们全都解体了——当然除了这位总管
you'll all have disintegrated,
except of course the Director.

172
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:35,760
闭嘴, 这里没你什么事
Be quiet, this has nothing to do with you.

173
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,780
是, 你完全正确, 这只跟他们俩有关
Yes, you're quite right, it only concerns these two.

174
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
我把嘴闭紧
I'll keep my mouth shut.

175
00:12:39,088 --> 00:12:41,216
我们最好联系盖特威克机场台
We'd better contact Gatwick Air Control.

176
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,768
我们跟盖特威克机场没什么事了
We've finished with Gatwick Airport.

177
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,768
如果他们跟我们还有事呢?
And what if they haven't finished with us?

178
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,648
那也是你自己的过失, 对不?
That would be your own fault, wouldn't it.

179
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:50,704
你跟我说所有的原身都藏好了
You told me that all the originals were hidden.

180
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,740
藏在一个不可能被找到的地方
Where they could not possibly be found

181
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,410
直到有同胞失去生命了
until the life have been drained from them.

182
00:12:54,912 --> 00:12:56,880
你现在才跟我说是你不小心?
Are you now telling me that you were careless?

183
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,312
联系盖特威克机场塔台
Contact Gatwick Air Control.

184
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:10,770
毁掉收发器
Destroy the transmitter.

185
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:13,600
好了
All right.

186
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,328
这里是变色龙总部, 呼叫盖特威克机场
This is Chameleon Head Quarters calling Gatwick Airport.

187
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:23,020
你能听到吗?
How do you read me?

188
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,424
盖特威克机场回复变色龙总部
Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Head Quarters.

189
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:29,328
我们能清晰地听到你的声音
We are reading you loud and clear.

190
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:32,864
你们现在能说明在哪里找到的原身吗?
Can you now state where you found the originals?

191
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:37,456
是在汽车停车场发现的
The originals were discovered in a car park.

192
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:42,144
为了证明这一点, 我们已经消灭了你们的一员. 一个男人
To prove it, we have already eliminated
one of your personnel. A man.

193
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,472
现在我期望同博士说话
I now wish to speak to the Doctor.

194
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,160
如果我不能马上听到他的声音
Unless I hear his voice immediately,

195
00:13:48,512 --> 00:13:51,584
下一个将被消灭的将是 Blade 机长
the next to be eliminated will be Captain Blade.

196
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,976
放了他!
Release him!

197
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:58,784
我说放了他
I said release him.

198
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:07,664
到麦克风那里去!
Get to that microphone!

199
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,504
先放了护士
Release the Nurse first.

200
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:14,448
我说了我期望同博士说话
I said I wished to speak to the Doctor,

201
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:17,710
否则下一个将会是 Blade 机长
otherwise the next will be Captain Blade.

202
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,270
博士, 麦克风
Doctor, the microphone.

203
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,040
你没事吧, 亲爱的
Are you quite all right, my dear.

204
00:14:23,104 --> 00:14:24,944
- 嗯, 我觉得没事  - 那就好
- Yes, I think so.   - Good.

205
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:33,000
总指挥, 我是博士
Commandant, this is the Doctor speaking.

206
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:34,544
啊, 真松了一口气
Ar, what a relief.

207
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:37,530
等着, 我去谈判
Stand by while I negotiate.

208
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:41,907
现在, 我跟你们说说我的条件
Now then, I will tell you my terms.

209
00:14:42,736 --> 00:14:45,824
我可以保障你们会继续存活
I will guarantee your continued existence,

210
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,728
只要你们归还所有被绑架的年轻人
if you will return to Earth
all the young people you abducted.

211
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:52,784
没用, 他们全都被缩小了
No use. They've all been miniaturised.

212
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,648
- 那就逆转这个过程  - 恐怕那不可能
- Then reverse the process.
- I'm afraid that's impossible,

213
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:59,008
- 相应的设备在我们星球上  - 他在撒谎
- The equipment for that is on our home planet.
- He's lying.

214
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:03,104
那些飞机本身就是缩微操作室, 可以双向运作
The planes themselves are the miniaturisation chambers
and they work both ways.

215
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,390
我们能以哪种形式继续存活, 博士?
What kind of continued existence would we have, Doctor?

216
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,816
恐怕只能是你们之前的形态
In your former state, I'm afraid.

217
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,576
你们的科学家得找出其它的方法, 来摆脱你们的困境
Your scientists will have to find
some other way out of your dilemma.

218
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,816
总比死了好
It's better than death.

219
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:20,528
我们接受
We accept.

220
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:24,176
好了, 我们接受
All right, we accept.

221
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:27,216
你们真是愚蠢, 怎么能相信他啊?
You fools, how can you trust him?

222
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:30,736
小心! 啊...
Look out! Ahh...

223
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,040
- 总指挥, 你还在那边吗?   - 在
- Commandant, are you still there?  - Yes.

224
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:50,048
谈判已按原定安排成功达成了
Negotiations have been successfully concluded as arranged.

225
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,440
好, 那我就让停车场的人保持原样, 直到你们返回
Good. I'll leave the people in the car park as they are
until you arrive back.

226
00:15:56,096 --> 00:16:00,020
好, 请继续监听这个频率
Good. Please stay listening out on this frequency.

227
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:02,688
我将让 Blade 机长负责无线电
I am leaving Captain Blade in charge of the radio.

228
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:04,928
- 你信得过他吗?   - 是的, 我想现在可以了
- Can you trust him? - Yes, I think I can now.

229
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:06,528
你打算做什么?
What are you going to do?

230
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:09,792
我要尽力去找到我的三个朋友, 还有督察
I'm going to try and find
my three friends and the Inspector.

231
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,088
- 你知道他们在哪里?   - 是的
- You know where they are?  - Yes.

232
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:13,840
你带我去找他们. 我会再同你们联系
You will take me to them. I will call you again.

233
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,696
收到
Roger.

234
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,720
好了, Heslington, 赶紧过来
Well, Heslington, flap over.

235
00:16:22,992 --> 00:16:25,440
我们尽我们所能, 让一切快点恢复正常吧
Let's get back to normal as quickly as we can.

236
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,560
在这里, 我不知道具体是哪个
Over here. I don't know which one.

237
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:37,728
- 博士!   - Jamie! 哈!
- Doctor!  - Jamie! Ha!

238
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:39,632
见到你还活着可真高兴
I'm glad to see you alive.

239
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,024
什么...你什么意思?
How... how do you mean?

240
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,672
回头再跟你说明吧, 现在赶紧出来
I'll explain to you one day. Well come along out.

241
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:47,584
你站在那里就像个岗亭里的士兵
You look like a soldier in a sentry box standing there!

242
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:48,912
坐下
Sit down.

243
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:50,912
没事, 他是个朋友
It's all right, he's a friend.

244
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,056
现在坐下, 我找找其他人
Now sit down while I find the others.

245
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,328
啊! Crossland 督察, 你在这里啊
Ah! Inspector Crossland. There we are.

246
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:07,760
接下来, Ben, Polly, 回到盖特威克
Now, Ben, Polly and back to Gatwick.

247
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,529
博士, 第一班飞机已经准备好起飞了
Doctor, the first plane is ready for take-off.

248
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,848
我们已经让所有被转换的人上去了, 包括你的三个朋友
We've got all the processed personnel
including your three young friends aboard.

249
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:33,936
啊, 很好
Ah, good.

250
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:35,328
你打算跟我们一起吗, 博士?
Are you going with us, Doctor.?

251
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:38,080
是的, 我打算跟 Pinto 护士一起
Yes, I'm going with Nurse Pinto.

252
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:40,208
你呢, 督察?
Are you going Inspector?

253
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,480
不, 我最好在这里再待一会儿, 捋一下头绪
No, I think I'd better stay here just for a while,
to... tidy things up.

254
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:46,976
- 你准备好了吗护士?   - 是的, 督察
- Are you ready nurse?   - Oh yes, Inspector.

255
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,808
- 我陪你去飞机  - 咱们飞机上见, 护士
- I'll see you to the plane.
- I'll see you on the plane Nurse.

256
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,110
我们的未来会怎样, 博士?
What will our future be Doctor?

257
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,731
只要你们遵守你们的承诺
So long as you keep your side of the bargain,

258
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:02,384
你们可以毫发无伤地回到自己的星球
you may return to your own planet unharmed.

259
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,688
也许你们的科学家能找到一个方法, 来摆脱你们的困境
Perhaps your scientists will be able to
find some way out of their dilemma.

260
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:11,296
我也许能给他们贡献一两个点子
I may be able to give them one or two ideas of my own.

261
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,024
好, 好, 我知道, 所有飞机跟你的飞机一样都在待命
Yes, yes, I know,
all flights were suspended as well as yours.

262
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:24,464
- 你好博士, 都安全地下来了  - 是的, 是的
- Hello Doctor. All down safely.  - Yes, yes.

263
00:18:24,496 --> 00:18:27,040
太好了, 太好了. 我现在得接这个布鲁塞尔的电话
Splendid, Splendid. I'll take that Brussels call now.

264
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,176
- 就还有一件事, 总指挥  - 是, 是, 好的
- There's just one thing Commandant.
- Yes, yes, right.

265
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,736
我们的TARDIS, 我们那个警察亭子
Our TARDIS. Our police box.

266
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,416
(法语)啊, 布鲁塞尔. 是的, 我同意
Ah Bruxelles. Oui, j'accord...

267
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:36,336
跑道上那个警察亭子
The police box on the runway.

268
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,840
当然, Jean, 帮博士取回他的东西, 行吗?
Of course, Jean, see that the Doctor
gets his property back, will you?

269
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:41,744
再见博士, 非常感谢你
Goodbye Doctor and thank you so much.

270
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:44,160
- 谢谢你总指挥  - 再见, 苏格兰小子
- Thank you Commandant.   - Goodbye scottie.

271
00:18:44,544 --> 00:18:45,856
再见, Samantha
Goodbye Samantha.

272
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,740
快来Jamie, 我们必须找到Ben和Polly
Come along Jamie, we must find Ben and Polly

273
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:48,980
还得找回 TARDIS
and get to the TARDIS.

274
00:18:51,728 --> 00:18:53,200
我还得道个别
I'd better say goodbye.

275
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:56,464
哦, 那回头见?
Oh, well I'll see you around then?

276
00:18:56,656 --> 00:18:58,256
回头在哪儿?
Around where?

277
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,912
噢, 你知道, 回头...
Well, you know, around...

278
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,648
啊你不会就这样走了吧?
Ah you're not just going off like that?

279
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,496
是, 我必须走. 否则博士...
Aye, I must go. The Doctor'll be...

280
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:09,824
哦你弟弟马上就会到这里了
Well your brother will be here any moment.

281
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:12,864
那, 拜拜啦!
Well, ta-ra then!

282
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,790
嘿, 感谢你所做的一切, Jamie
Hey, thanks for everything, Jamie.

283
00:19:20,304 --> 00:19:21,744
我得说再见了
I'll say goodbye.

284
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:27,904
再见, Jamie
Goodbye Jamie.

285
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,600
这样就行. 给总指挥带个感谢
This will do. My thanks to the Commandant.

286
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,780
非常谢谢你
Thank you every much.

287
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:43,632
嘿, 博士, 你要去哪儿?
Hey, Doctor, where are you going?

288
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,280
嘿, 回来
Hey, come back.

289
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,888
博士
Doctor.

290
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,472
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

291
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,760
做什么? 我在找 TARDIS 啊, 当然了
Doing? I'm looking for the TARDIS, of course.

292
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:06,912
不要啊, 我们就不能在伦敦待一小会儿吗?
Oh no, can't we stay in London a bit?

293
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:08,832
是啊, 能回到正常可真是太好了
Yeah, it's good to feel normal again.

294
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:10,064
正常? 你什么意思, Ben?
Normal? What do you mean, Ben?

295
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,384
就是, 没有怪物, 没有赛博人
Well, no monsters, or Cybermen.

296
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:14,512
现在这些, 就很正常, 这是我的理解
All this - it's normal. I understand it.

297
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:17,936
是吗, 变色龙观光游怎么说?
Do you? What about Chameleon Tours?

298
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:19,120
哦, 这是特殊情况
Oh yeah, that was different!

299
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,088
我对于离开这里倒是很高兴
Oh I'll be glad to get away from here.

300
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,368
你就不能把我们送到一个像1750年那样先进的地方吗?
Can you not land us in a nice civilised place like 1750?

301
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,990
1966年怎么就不先进了?
What's so uncivilised about 1966?

302
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,160
得, 你自己留着吧
Oh, you can keep it!

303
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,376
- 你说这是1966年?  - 是
- Did you say 1966.  - Yes.

304
00:20:31,504 --> 00:20:32,496
现在是几月?
What month is it?

305
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:36,192
六月. 确切地说, 6月20号
It's July. July the 20th, to be precise.

306
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,368
你想到什么了?
What are you getting at?

307
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:43,136
你没明白吗, 小姐? 1966年6月20号, 一切开始的时间!
Don't you see, Duchess?
July the 20th, 1966 is when it all began!

308
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,448
我们回到了一开始的起点! 啊, 我觉得....
We're back to when it all started! Well, I think...

309
00:20:46,768 --> 00:20:50,320
这就是说...就好像我们从来没有离开过!
That means it's as... it's as if we've never been away!

310
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:52,896
你们真的想走, 是吧?
You really want to go, don't you.

311
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:57,088
这个, 我们不会走的, 博士, 假如你真的需要我们
Well, we won't leave, Doctor, if you really need us.

312
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:02,960
问题是, 这...这是我们的世界
The thing is, it... it is our world.

313
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,512
是的, 我知道
Yes, I know.

314
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:08,110
你们很幸运, 我就从来没能回到过我的世界...
You're lucky, I never got back to mine...

315
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:13,300
好吧, 你们走吧!
All right, then. Off you go!

316
00:21:13,952 --> 00:21:18,172
继续, Ben 可以赶上他的轮船, 成长为一位海军军官
Now go on, Ben can catch his ship and become an Admiral

317
00:21:18,368 --> 00:21:20,208
而你 Polly, 你可以照顾 Ben
and you Polly, you can look after Ben.

318
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:22,912
我会的
I will.

319
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,832
你们俩注意安全, 好吗?
You will be safe, won't you?

320
00:21:27,104 --> 00:21:30,144
- 我会看着他的  - 我相信你会的, 老兄
- I'll look after him.  - I'm sure you will, mate.

321
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:33,648
再见博士
Goodbye Doctor.

322
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,784
我们可能某个时候再见, 保重
We might see you sometime. Take care.

323
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,712
你们得快点了, 总指挥的车在等呢
Well you'd better hurry. The Commandant's car's waiting.

324
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,960
看他们走我有点伤感
I'm sad to see them go.

325
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:55,136
是啊 Jamie, 我也是
Yes Jamie, so am I.

326
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,464
不过, 我们还有事情要做
Well, we've got things to do.

327
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,328
- 什么事情?   - 哦, 我还没告诉他们, 不过...
- What things?  - Well, I didn't tell the others but...

328
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,136
我们的 TARDIS 丢了!
We've lost the TARDIS!

329
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:06,432
不可能
We can't have done.

330
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,192
刚才还在外面 - 但现在不在那里了
It was outside - it's not there now.

331
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,656
- 你是说, 有人偷走了!   - 我不知道
- You mean somebody's stolen it?  - I don't know,

332
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:13,504
不过这正是我们要去搞明白的, 快点!
But that's what we're going to find out! Come on!
