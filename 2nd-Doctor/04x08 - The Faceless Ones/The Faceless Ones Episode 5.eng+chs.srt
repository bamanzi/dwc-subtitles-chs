1
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:04,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,070
海上救援队报告说没有找到，先生
Negative report from Air Sea Rescue, sir.

3
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,944
但有两架飞机掉了，肯定会有残骸的痕迹啊
But with two aircraft ditching, 
there must be some signs of wreckage.

4
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:33,936
你为什么觉得变色龙的飞机是坠落到海里了？
Why do you think the Chameleon plane
crashed into the sea?

5
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:36,224
因为它从我们的雷达屏幕上消失了！
Because it disappeared off our radar screen!

6
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:37,728
但它一开始是静止没动！
But it stood still first!

7
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:40,784
因为它肯定是跟空军的飞机撞上了，然后掉落下去
Because it must have collided with
the RAF plane and dropped like a stone.

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,250
你为什么会这么想
Why do you think that?

9
00:00:42,832 --> 00:00:46,912
要知道，当一架飞机像那样在雷达上静止不动
You see, when a plane on that radar
appears to stand still,

10
00:00:46,976 --> 00:00:49,520
那么它事实上就是直线下落了
it is in point of fact dropping straight down.

11
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:51,920
- 直线上升怎么样？  - 噢，我亲爱的博士
- What about straight up? - Oh my dear Doctor! 

12
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:54,912
要能像那样跑出我们雷达的范围
To get above our radar umbrella like that

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,688
它必须垂直爬上达到100英里高
it would have to climb vertically
until it was a hundred miles high.

14
00:00:59,152 --> 00:01:01,360
那该死的高度就是外太空了
The darned thing would be in outer space.

15
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,800
正是这个！
Exactly!

16
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,360
那架派来跟踪我们的飞机，咱们要摧毁它吗？
That plane they sent to follow us.
Should we have destroyed it?

17
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,072
他们的玩具飞机，我们可以消灭他们一个中队
We could eliminate a whole squadron of their toy planes

18
00:01:47,104 --> 00:01:48,560
而他们一点都够不着我们
and they'd never get on to us.

19
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:52,080
他们的脑子应付不了这样的行动
Their minds can't cope with an operation like this.

20
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:56,400
要记得我们总监的教导：地球人的智力
Remember the teaching of our Director -
the intelligence of Earth people

21
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:00,368
只跟我们星球的动物差不多
is comparable only to that of animals on our planet.

22
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,880
我就说我漏掉了一个，还在想你到底哪儿去了
I thought I'd missed one of you.
I wondered what happened to you.

23
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,424
- 你对他们做什么了？  - 关上抽屉
- What have you done to them?!
- Close that drawer.

24
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,680
不... 不...不要。别碰我
No... No... Don't. leave me.

25
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,608
好，谢谢你
Right, thank you.

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,072
海上救援队说他们还在搜索，但仍然没有任何痕迹
Air Sea Rescue say they're still searching
but there's no trace yet.

27
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:28,624
总指挥
Commandant.

28
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:33,408
我知道了。飞行员成功逃生了吗？
I see - did the pilot managed to bail out?

29
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:36,352
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,064
他们发现了空军飞机的残骸
They've found the remains of that RAF plane.

31
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:42,384
飞行员已经被电死了
The pilot had been electrocuted.

32
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,168
你还觉得这些人是来自地球？
Do you still think these people are from Earth?

33
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,784
我不知道，博士。我不知道该怎么思考了
I don't know, Doctor.
I just don't know what to think.

34
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:52,544
但凡有那么一丝确凿的证据就好了
If only there was one solid piece of evidence.

35
00:04:52,912 --> 00:04:55,328
我觉得证据正好进来了！
I think it's just come in!

36
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:57,112
你介意我去盘问他吗？
Do you mind if I question him?//

37
00:04:57,224 --> 00:04:59,312
我想我知道怎么撬开他的嘴
I think I know how to make him talk.

38
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:10,256
你知道这是什么东西，对吧？
You know what this is, don't you?

39
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,556
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.//

40
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,416
噢，我觉得你知道。把你的袖子卷起来
Oh I think you do.
Roll up your sleeve.

41
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:16,272
我必须得听他的吗，先生？
Do I have to take orders from him, sir?

42
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,096
我觉得应该解释一下，博士
I think perhaps you should explain, Doctor.

43
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,930
毕竟呢，这个人是为我工作的
After all, this man is working for me.

44
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,648
只是你觉得他在为你工作！
You only think he's working for you!

45
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,448
总指挥，你的人员正在被系统性地替换掉
Commandant, your personnel
are being systematically replaced. 

46
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,790
而这就是他们替换的方法
And this is how they're doing it.

47
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,872
这人不是 Meadows, 只是看起来像 Meadows
This is not Meadows, it only looks like Meadows.

48
00:05:29,904 --> 00:05:32,064
而他的一个胳膊上带着一个这样的东西
He's wearing one of these things on his arm.

49
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,888
那好吧，按他说的做
Very well, do as he asks.

50
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,288
- 但是先生，这太荒谬了 - 我们都得为这事出力
- But sir, this is ridiculous...
- We all have to help in this

51
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,192
Meadows, 卷起你的袖子
Meadows. Roll up your sleeve.

52
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,400
拦住他！
STOP HIM!

53
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,640
把他弄到椅子上
Now get him in this chair.

54
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:48,848
Jean，叫警察
Jean, send for the police.

55
00:05:52,064 --> 00:05:54,528
好了，博士，开始吧
All right Doctor, go ahead!

56
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,448
卷起他的左袖
Roll up his left sleeve.

57
00:06:00,128 --> 00:06:03,744
准备好了，现在开始
There we are. Now then.

58
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:07,920
如果我转动这里面一个旋钮，会怎样？
What happens if I were to turn one of these? 

59
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:08,880
别碰它！
Don't touch it!

60
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,376
啊，我明白了。好
Ah, I see. Right.

61
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,704
那么现在，你得回答我所有的问题了
Now then, you are going to answer all my questions.

62
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:20,048
而作为回报，我承诺不会伤害你
And in return, I promise no harm will come to you.

63
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,312
- 你明白了吗？  - 好吧
- Do you understand?   - All right.

64
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,976
你们的飞机把所有的乘客带到哪里去了？
Where are your planes taking all their passengers?

65
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:31,280
有一颗卫星，大约在150英里高空
There's a satellite,
about a hundred and fifty miles up.

66
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,300
你们为什么要绑架这些年轻人》
Why are you abducting all these young people?

67
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,110
我们的星球发生了一场大灾难，一次巨大的爆炸
We had a catastrophe on our planet.
A gigantic explosion.

68
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:41,424
如你所见，我们已经失去了自己的身份
As you've seen, we have lost our identities.//

69
00:06:41,524 --> 00:06:43,024
我们的人要灭亡了！
My people are dying out!

70
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:46,048
但我们的人对你们有什么用？
But what use would our people be to you?

71
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,960
我们的科学家研究出来一个方法
Our scientists devised a process...

72
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,160
可以让我们得到另外一种生物的形体
so that we could take on the
physical characterises of another being.

73
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:53,392
而这就是这种方法的其中一步？
This is part of the process?

74
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:54,880
是，这就是为什么你不能碰那个
Yes, that's why you mustn't touch it.

75
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:58,272
你们打算绑架多少年轻人？
How many of these young people
do you hope to abduct?

76
00:06:58,912 --> 00:07:01,440
这一次 - 四万
This time - Fifty thousand.

77
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,280
- 四万！  - 那个卫星有多大？
- Fifty thousand! - How large is this satellite?

78
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:09,520
在我们的飞机上，这些乘客会被缩小
On the journey in our planes,
the passengers are miniaturised.

79
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:14,640
我明白了。你们有多少人现在在盖特威克机场？
I see. How many of your people
are working here at Gatwick Airport?

80
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,540
我不知道
I don't know.//

81
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,240
这是真的，我跟你说，我不知道
That's the truth, I tell you. I don't know.

82
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,216
好吧。那我们的人怎么样了？
Very well. What happens to the people//

83
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,816
我们那些被换到身份的人，那些原身？
whose identities have been taken over, the originals?

84
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,784
他们在机场某个地方，我...我不知道具体在哪里
They're somewhere in the Airport,
I... I don't know exactly where.

85
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,008
我要把这个地方翻个底朝天，来找到他们
I'll have the whole place
torn to pieces to find them.

86
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,944
- 不，你不能去找他们  - 为什么不能？
- No, you mustn't find them. -  Why not?

87
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:35,232
你们...不能去，就是不能去
You... you mustn't, that's all.

88
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:38,416
因为如果我们真找到他们，就会在他们胳膊上找到这个，嗯？
Because if we do find them
we'll find one of these on their arms, eh?

89
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,936
而如果我们卸下它，就会有可怕的事情发生在你们身上？
And if we remove it,
something terrible will happen to you?

90
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,670
是的
Yes.

91
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,400
如果你们必须换回来怎么办？
What if you have to change back?

92
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:47,424
哦，那可以实现，但需要机器
Well, that can be done, but with the machine.

93
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:50,450
- 医护中心的那个机器？  - 对
- The machine in the Medical Centre?  - Yes.

94
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:55,520
我们谁也不知道我们的原身在哪里，除了那个护士
None of us know where our own originals are.
Except that Nurse.

95
00:07:56,512 --> 00:07:59,060
- 护士？她什么情况？  - 噢，她可真狡猾
- Nurse? What about her?  - Oh she was cunning. 

96
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,320
- 她把她的原身带在身边的  - 在哪里？
- She's got her own original with her.
- Where is it?

97
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:05,136
- 我不知道  - 我觉得你知道
- I don't know.  - I think you do know.

98
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,448
- 现在，你打算告诉我不？  - 在医护中心
- Now, are you going to tell me?
- It's in the Medical Centre.

99
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:10,928
很好，你得只给我看具体是哪里
Right. You're going to show me where it is.

100
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,960
我...我不敢，她会摧毁我的
I... I daren't. She'll have me destroyed.

101
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,740
你是打算合作呢，还是不合作？
Are you going to co-operate or are you not?

102
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,960
好吧，反正也没什么区别了
All right. It won't make any difference.

103
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:23,856
你再也见不到那五万个年轻人了！
You'll never see those
fifty thousand young people again!

104
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:27,220
我觉得我最好把他带过来 - 医护中心
I think I'd better take him down
there - the Medical Centre.

105
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:53,520
什么事
What is it?

106
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,304
那个女孩。我们怎么处置她？
This girl. What do we do with her?

107
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:59,088
我们需要把她用作原身
We need to use her as an original. 

108
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,972
这样我们就可以安排一个我们的人
That way we can get one of our people//

109
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,672
在那个威胁我们的家伙身边
close to the man who is menacing us.

110
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:04,880
然后就可以杀了他
He will then be killed.

111
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:08,752
但 Blade 机长没打算带我们的人去地球...
But surely Captain Blade isn't
bringing any more of our people to Earth...

112
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,270
需要帮忙吗？
Can I help you?

113
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,580
带他进来
Bring him in.

114
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,208
恐怕我没搞懂
I'm afraid I don't understand.

115
00:09:20,304 --> 00:09:22,720
我想你们俩有些共同点
I think you two have something in common.

116
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:25,072
那个人病了吗，警官？
Is this man ill, officer?

117
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,448
卷起你的袖子
Roll up your sleeves.

118
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,544
- 你在说些什么？  - 警官！
- What are you talking about?   - Officer!

119
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,960
请把你的手拿开
Please take your hands off me.

120
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:34,096
没问题。我想看的都看到了
Certainly. I've seen all I want to see. 

121
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:36,144
我来拿这个，如果你不介意的话FIXME
I'll have that, if you don't mind!

122
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:42,048
好了，她的原身在哪里？
Now then, where is her original?

123
00:09:42,144 --> 00:09:43,168
在那里面
It's in there.

124
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,448
- 你不能进里面去！  - 你还是愿意被毁灭喏？
- You can't go in there! 
- Would you rather be destroyed?

125
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,656
看着他，警官
Keep an eye on her, officer.

126
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:49,824
把他带过来
Bring him along.

127
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,176
Sam! Sam, 你没事吧
Sam! Sam, are you all right?

128
00:09:57,616 --> 00:09:59,360
- 你还好吧，Sam！  - 还好
- Are you all right Sam!  - Yes!

129
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,360
我还以为我完蛋了
I thought I was done for there.

130
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:07,936
- 手脚发麻  - 你运气好没有变得更严重
- Pins and needles... 
- You're lucky it was no worse.

131
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,424
- 你在干什么？  - FIXME
- What are you doing? - Just checking up!

132
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:14,816
好了，护士的原身在哪里？
Now then, where is the Nurse's original?

133
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,416
在墙里某处的嵌板里面
It's in a panel in the wall somewhere.

134
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:18,096
开关在躺椅里面
The control's in the couch there.

135
00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:20,020
好了，警官
All right, Officer.

136
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,560
见鬼诶，她还真在里面
Flipping heck! But she's in there!

137
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,664
你个叛徒！
You traitor!

138
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,752
小心!
Look out!

139
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,760
没事了 Sam，没事了
It's all right Sam. It's all right.

140
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:09,536
她消失了
She's vanished!

141
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,624
博士
Doctor.

142
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,848
把她放到那儿
Put her on here.

143
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:18,677
就这里吧
There we are.

144
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:22,928
- 会造成永久性损伤吗？  - 不会
- Will there be any permanent damage?  - No.

145
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,368
你可以把那个拿下来了
You can take that off now.

146
00:11:30,832 --> 00:11:35,390
没事了，再过一两分钟你就完全没事了，来
It's all right. You'll be quite all right
in a few minutes. There.

147
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,790
博士，Jamie 他怎么了？
Doctor, what's happened to Jamie?

148
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:47,712
这些东西到底是做什么用的？FIXME
What on Earth are these doing here?

149
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:50,384
博士，上一次Jamie并不在柜台附近啊FIXME
Doctor, Jamie wasn't anywhere
near the kiosk the last time...

150
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,200
嘿你都没有在听，我觉得他们抓走了 Jamie!
Look you're not listening.
I think they've got Jamie!

151
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:55,376
- Jamie! 哪儿？  - 你应该知道的
- Jamie! Where?!  - Well you should know.

152
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,616
- 你让他顺走了我的机票？ - 顺走你的机票？
- You got him to pinch me ticket! 
- Pinch your ticket?

153
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:59,232
为了阻止我去罗马
To stop me from going to Rome.

154
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,032
- 噢，你是说 Jamie  - 顶替了我
- Oh you mean Jamie... 
- Has gone in my place.

155
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,360
先是 Polly 和 Ben，现在又是 Jamie
First Polly and Ben, and now Jamie.

156
00:12:05,616 --> 00:12:07,440
我们不能再耽误时间了
We've no time to lose.

157
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,064
督察！
Inspector!

158
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:31,664
我们看看我能不能把你救出来
Let's see if I can get you out of there.

159
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:34,944
你怎么到这里来的？
How did you get here?

160
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,176
我...坐飞机来的，偷了别人的票
I... I came on the plane, stole someone's ticket.

161
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,944
你应该在路上就被小型化了
You ought to have been miniaturised on the journey.

162
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,816
小... 小型化？
Min... miniaturised?

163
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:46,224
被缩小了，就像柜子里所有这些年轻人这样
Reduced in size - like all the
youngsters in these cabins.

164
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,184
你没有吃喝什么吧？
Did you not have anything to eat or drink?

165
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:51,120
没有，我...觉得太难受了！
No, I... I felt too ill!

166
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:54,368
这就能解释了，那些食物是整个过程中的第一步
That explains it. The food is
the first part of the process.

167
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,608
督察，这是什么地方
Inspector, what is this place?

168
00:12:56,928 --> 00:13:00,736
一颗卫星，Jamie。在太空的一艘飞船
A satellite, Jamie. A flying ship in space.

169
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:04,704
这些人来自另外的星球，看起来博士一直都是对的
These people are from another planet. 
It seems the Doctor was right after all.

170
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:07,856
下面那些人有人相信他了吗？
Does anyone down there believe him yet?

171
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:10,480
噢，我...不太清楚。我...估计没有
Oh I... I'm not sure. I... I don't think so.

172
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,896
我估计这对他们来说太难以置信了
I suppose it is too much for them to believe.

173
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:16,720
但博士肯定已经让他们相信有事发生了吧？
But surely the Doctor's convinced them
that something is going on?

174
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:19,296
嗯，我觉得总指挥可能...
Aye, I think maybe the Commandant...

175
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,240
是的，Jamie
Yes, Jamie.

176
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:22,832
督察，你是逃出来的还是怎么的？
Inspector, have you escaped or something?

177
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,672
没谁能从这里逃走
No-one escapes from here.

178
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:26,784
但是那架飞到这里的飞机
But the plane that comes here.

179
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,568
它肯定会回到地球去，我们可以登上飞机
Well it must go back to Earth.
We could get on it!

180
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,680
最后一趟飞往地球的飞机已经走了
The last plane to Earth is leaving now.

181
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,096
他们只是回去接他们自己的人
They've just gone back to pick up their own people.

182
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,104
肯定博士会想到什么方法救我们
Surely the Doctor will think of some way of rescuing us.

183
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,480
这次不行了，Jamie
Not this time, Jamie.

184
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,144
这一次，他要对付的是比他还高级的脑子
This time, he's up against
a mind superior even to his.

185
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:44,208
总监的脑子
The mind of the Director.

186
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,024
你是说比博士还聪明？
You mean someone clever than the Doctor?

187
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,152
是负责这整个行动的人
The man in charge of this whole mission.

188
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,552
你似乎知道得不少，督察
You seem to know a lot about it, Inspector.

189
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:55,472
我当然知道，Jamie。我就是总监！
Of course I do, Jamie. I am the Director!

190
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,920
变色龙飞机就是在这个方位消失的
This is the bearing
where the Chameleon plane vanished.

191
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:36,902
我想知道它还会不会在这里出现
I want to know if it reappears there.//

192
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:38,592
他们下一个航班快到时间了
They've a flight due any minute.

193
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,392
很好先生
Very good sir.

194
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,344
博士，这些人事档案是怎么回事?
Now then Doctor, what's
all this about personnel files?

195
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:42,400
过来，我展示给你
Over here, I'll show you.

196
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,472
我在医疗中心找到这些的
I found these in the Medical Centre.

197
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,584
记录属于25个在这里工作的人
Records of twenty-five people who work here.

198
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,208
每一个都被变色龙给替换掉了
Each one of these has been taken over by Chameleons.

199
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,592
好，我会安排人在15分钟内将他们都抓起来！
Right. I'll have them all
under arrest within fifteen minutes!

200
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,480
Airport Police please.
请接机场警局

201
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,880
- 现在看看这个  - 这是什么？
- Now look at this.   - What is it?

202
00:14:56,992 --> 00:14:58,256
变色龙的飞行排班表
Chameleon Air Schedules.

203
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,680
你看这里？他们这个季节的最后一班还有不到一个小时
You see here? Their last flight
of the season goes in an hour.

204
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:03,240
呃..请接 Reynolds 警司
Er.. Superintendent Reynolds please.

205
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:06,080
最后一班？那他们就不能抓了
The last flight? Well that's exactly
why they mustn't be arrested.

206
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:07,648
警司吗？我是总指挥
Superintendent? Commandant here.

207
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,440
- 你能听我说吗！  - 你能等一会儿吗？
- Will you please listen to me! 
- Will you hold on a moment please?

208
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:11,728
- 这些人不能抓  - 为什么不能？
- These people must not be arrested. - Why not?

209
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:13,728
在外太空某个地方
Somewhere in outer space,

210
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,944
还有五万个年轻人，包括我的三个朋友
there are fifty thousand young people,
three of my friends amongst them,

211
00:15:16,992 --> 00:15:18,864
我们得想办法把他们弄回来
and somehow we've got to bring them back.

212
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,632
我想登上这趟最后的航班
I want to get on this last flight,

213
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:25,560
也就意味着得让变色龙认为一切正常
which means the Chameleons must think that 
everything is going according to plan.

214
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:26,544
总指挥？
Commandant?

215
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,328
Reynolds, 我回头再打给你
Reynolds, I'll call you back.

216
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,280
现在怎样？
Now what is it?

217
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,360
光点。突然凭空出现了，正朝这边过来！
This blip. It's just appeared out of nowhere
and it's coming this way!

218
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,448
好，跟踪住他们。可能是变色龙的飞机回来了
Right well keep tracking them.
It may be the Chameleon plane returning.

219
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:39,891
现在看这里，博士
Now look here, Doctor.

220
00:15:40,016 --> 00:15:42,864
一直都在说登上那架飞机，但怎么做呢？
All very well talking about
getting on that plane, but how?

221
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:47,680
当前来看，你看起来像是一个叫 Meadows 的人
At the moment, you look like a man called Meadows.

222
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:50,970
你能移除这个身份，变成另外一个人吗？
Could you shed that identity
and become somebody else?

223
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,512
可以，我们中有些人被处理过两次
Yes. Yes, some of our people
have been processed twice.

224
00:15:54,608 --> 00:16:00,048
好。那这样的话我就假装成一个变色龙，就这样上去
Good. Then in that case I shall pretend 
I am a Chameleon, and get on board that way.

225
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:02,380
就算你登上那架飞机，你期望能做些什么呢？
But even if you get on that plane,
what do you hope to do?

226
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,728
我也不知道，得等到了卫星之后再说
I don't know until I get to the satellite...

227
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,728
而我只有一张牌可以打
and then I will have one card to play.

228
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,080
- 而这就取决于你了，总指挥  - 什么？
- And that's up to you Commandant. - What's that?

229
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,024
那些被变色龙顶替掉的人，那些真身
The people the Chameleons
have taken over, the originals,

230
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,190
被藏在盖特威克机场某个地方
are hidden somewhere here in Gatwick Airport.

231
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,920
- 你必须给找出来  - 当然，
- You have got to find them.
- Of course //

232
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,320
还得把那恐怖的东西从他们胳膊上卸下来
and get those fearful things off their arms.

233
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,096
不，不，不！用尽各种方法，找到他们
No, no, no! Find them, by all means,//

234
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,696
但不要去动胳膊上的护套
but don't tamper with those arm sheaths.

235
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,980
否则我们就没有了威胁
Otherwise we lose our one threat -//

236
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,280
the one thing I may be able to bargain with!
这可能是我能同他们讨价还价的唯一筹码！

237
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:28,304
我明白了。但我还是没明白你怎么能登上飞机
Yes I see that. But I still don't see
how you're going to get on that plane, 

238
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:30,688
尤其是怎么能让他们相信，你是他们一员
let alone convince them
that you're one of their people.

239
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,504
那就得完全有赖于 Pinto 护士了
That will depend entirely on Nurse Pinto.

240
00:16:34,432 --> 00:16:37,472
Jean，接警司 Reynolds
Jean, get onto Superintendent. Reynolds.

241
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,488
现在一切都清楚了吧？
Now is everything clear?

242
00:16:42,096 --> 00:16:44,370
你确定你理解了我要让你做什么？
You're sure you understand
what I am asking you to do?

243
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:48,720
当然，但我们得为那些年轻人考虑
Yes, of course, but we've got to
think of those young people.

244
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:55,008
很是方便FIXME
How very convenient.

245
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,968
- 锁上门  - 别，别开枪！
- Lock the door.  - No, don't shoot! 

246
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,648
这是 Meadows，他得重新处理一下
This is Meadows. He had to be re-processed.

247
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:04,032
为什么？
Why?

248
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,608
博士已经很怀疑这个 Meadows 了
The Doctor became too suspicious of me as Meadows.

249
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,432
我成功绑架了他。FIXME
I was able to kidnap him.
The rest is as you can see.

250
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:17,728
有点遗憾，本来有个人在航空控制塔台会很有用的
A pity. It was useful having
someone in Air Traffic Control.

251
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,712
当然我们掌控了博士的脑子也很不错
But then of course we have possession
of the Doctor's brain.

252
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:23,920
你觉得它会很有用吗？
You think that will be useful?

253
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,040
毫无疑问
Undoubtedly.

254
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,648
也就是说你会带我们到卫星上去？
That means that you'll be taking us
up to the satellite?

255
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,088
下一班我会带上所有人回到卫星
I am taking everybody back to
the satellite on the next plane.

256
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:37,152
这是最后一班了，这你肯定没忘吧
It's the last flight.
Surely you haven't forgotten that?

257
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:41,456
二次处理，太难记清楚细节了
The re-processing.
It's difficult to remember details.

258
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,256
是的，当然，我理解
Yes, of course, I understand.

259
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,296
你把他的真身怎么样了？
What have you done with his original?

260
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,960
在一个安全的地方
In a safe place.

261
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:50,480
跟其它的在一起
It should be with the others.

262
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:53,216
告诉具体是哪儿，我安排转过来
Tell me where that is
and I'll have it transferred.

263
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,056
没时间干这个了
There's no time for that now.

264
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:58,784
Jenkins 会帮你搞定出入境手续的
Jenkins will see you through Immigration.

265
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:01,904
我们会在15分钟后离开
We leave in fifteen minutes.

266
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,424
- 你觉得我们骗过他了吗？  - 说不好
- Do you think we convinced him?
- I don't know.

267
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,360
不管怎么说我们可以上飞机了，快点，我们别晚了
However we've got aboard that plane.
Come on, don't let's be late.

268
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,248
好的，谢谢
Right. Thank you.

269
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,928
是警方打来的，先生
That was the police, sir. //

270
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,928
他们说变色龙飞机的乘客已经在登机了
They say the passengers are now
boarding the Chameleon plane.

271
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,816
他们看到博士登上飞机了吗？
Did they see if the Doctor had got on board?

272
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,996
看到了，他和 Pinto 护士一起
Yes. He was with Nurse Pinto.

273
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,696
所有乘客都是成年人
All the passengers are adults

274
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:27,936
他们中的大多数人都是机场职员
and most of them have been
identified as airport personnel.

275
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:31,696
总指挥，变色龙飞机请求起飞
Commandant. Chameleon plane's requesting
clearance for start up.

276
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:35,664
好吧 Heslington, 程序照常，给他们许可
All right Heslington, normal procedure.
Give them clearance.

277
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:40,576
变色龙345，请准备
Chameleon Three-Four-Five,
stand by for start temperature...

278
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:52,836
是了，现在又是静止状态了
Yes. Now it's stationary.//

279
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:55,536
它肯定又在垂直爬升
It must be ascending vertically.

280
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,300
观点变弱了，先生
The blip's getting fainter, sir.

281
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,600
那就是说他已经超出了我们雷达的范围
That means he's rising above our radar umbrella.

282
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,870
啊，警司，真是你啊
Ah Superintendent, the very man.

283
00:19:01,904 --> 00:19:02,560
光点消失了，先生
Blip's just gone, sir.

284
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:04,160
你看，Reynolds
Now look, Reynolds.

285
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,680
我们得把你那里的每一个人都派去搜寻
We've got to get every man
of your force on that search.

286
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:10,848
一刻也不能浪费。我们的时间不多了
There isn't a moment to lose.
Time's running out on us.

287
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,304
- 有消息吗？  - 没，看那个！
- Any luck?  - No. Look at that!

288
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,320
期望我的文件跟这一样整齐！
Wish my files were as neat as that!

289
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:31,600
你怎么样，柜台那里有什么？
How about you. What about the kiosk?

290
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:32,800
没什么，只有一些文件
Not much. Just a few papers.

291
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:35,504
唔，我们最好回到塔台去
Hmm... Oh we'd better get back
to Air Traffic Control then.

292
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,648
- 怎样？  - 就有一些文件，先生
- Well?  - Just a few papers sir.

293
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:47,216
也好，也许里面有点线索
Well, there might be a clue there.

294
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,008
总指挥，他们肯定是把他们放到某个地方了
Commandant, surely they'd
put them somewhere... 

295
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,560
我的意思是，某个我们不会想到的地方
I mean, well somewhere we'd never think of.

296
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,988
我们得好好想想，Jean，不管它是哪儿
We've got to think of it, Jean, wherever it is.

297
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,288
博士还指望我们呢
The Doctor's relying on us.

298
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,256
成千上万人的性命有赖于我们找到那些真身，还得快！
Thousands of lives are depending on us
finding those originals - and quickly!

299
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,720
- 还有多久，博士？  - 我不知道
- How much longer, Doctor?  - I don't know.

300
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:10,144
我觉得我们快到了，别担心
I should think we're almost there. Don't worry.

301
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,296
等一下！
One moment!

302
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:47,168
由于我们的行动取得了圆满成功
Owing to the complete success of our operation,

303
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:51,936
我们的卫星上的生存空间不得不用于我们的货物
living space on our satellite
has had to be used for our... cargo.

304
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,056
所以，舱室会重新分配
Therefore, quarters will be re-allocated.

305
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:58,600
向住宿中心报告以获得指示
Report to the accommodation centre
for instructions.

306
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:03,152
你觉得他起疑心了没？
Do you think he's suspects?

307
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,736
说不好，我们先跟其他人走吧
I don't know. Let's follow the others.

308
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,550
你叫什么名字？
What is your name?

309
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,584
重试一遍，你叫什么名字？
Try again, What is your name?

310
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,020
Jamie​
Jamie.

311
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,070
你从哪里来？
Where do you come from?

312
00:21:23,312 --> 00:21:26,128
从地球，一个叫做苏格兰的地方
From Earth, a place called Scotland.

313
00:21:26,336 --> 00:21:27,328
非常好
Excellent.

314
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,224
- 总监  - 什么事？
- Director.  - What is it?

315
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,912
我们发现了两个冒牌货：博士和 Pinto 护士
We have found two impostors. 
The Doctor and Nurse Pinto.

316
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,470
我请求授权我去消灭他们
I want permission to have them destroyed.

317
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,848
等一下，对于博士你都知道些什么？
One moment. What do you know about the Doctor?

318
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,536
他不是这个星球也不是这个时代的人
He is not of this Earth or of this century.

319
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,080
他穿越过时空
He has travelled through time and space.

320
00:21:46,688 --> 00:21:48,928
他的知识甚至超过我们
His knowledge is even greater than ours.

321
00:21:49,232 --> 00:21:52,544
总监，这个人对我们是个危险，必须被消灭
Director, this man is a danger to us,
he should be destroyed.

322
00:21:53,264 --> 00:21:56,032
但我说他必须活着 - 不过是作为我们的人
And I say he must live - but as one of us.

323
00:21:56,752 --> 00:21:58,336
你会后悔的
You will regret it.

324
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:00,928
你收到命令了，Blade 机长
You have your orders, Captain Blade.

325
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,232
我们现在怎么办？
What do we do now?

326
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:16,656
我们开溜，看看我们能后找到那些年轻人，快点
We slip away and see if we can
find these young people. Come on.

327
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,896
啊，Blade 机长，我们在按你的指令行事
Ah, Captain Blade,
we're carrying out your instructions.

328
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:25,392
我们在找住宿中心
We're looking for the accommodation centre.

329
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,016
我的指令对你们不适用
My instructions don't apply to you.

330
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,280
你们俩将不再需要居住空间了
You two won't be needing living space.
