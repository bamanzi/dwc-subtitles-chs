1
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:20,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:57,566 --> 00:00:58,539
All set.

3
00:00:59,017 --> 00:00:59,812
Good.

4
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:21,675
You wanted to know the secret of Chameleon Tours. Well Inspector, see for yourself!

5
00:01:36,323 --> 00:01:37,630
Doctor!

6
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:41,447
He's dead! You're coming with me.

7
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:42,653
I'll not leave him.

8
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:45,262
You have five seconds to change your mind.

9
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:46,703
You'll have to kill me then.

10
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:53,149
I said five seconds. Five, four, three...

11
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,310
SAMANTHA!

12
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:21,250
I suppose there's no use my asking where this plane's going to?

13
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:22,947
You will know soon enough.

14
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:36,599
This is Plane Number Three to Base. Inform the Director that I have an original for him as ordered. I am delivering him now, and will return immediately to Gatwick Airport.

15
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:41,220
Jamie? Are you all right?

16
00:03:41,545 --> 00:03:45,731
Aye. Th... They've not harmed you, have they?

17
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:49,569
No - but I can't move.

18
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:52,457
Doctor?

19
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:54,596
Are you all right?

20
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:59,076
What's happening? I... I can't move. What's that?

21
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:03,274
I... I don't know. It's a beam of light.

22
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:08,634
Aye. Doctor, it... it's moving towards us!

23
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,458
That's just a small fore-taste of what'll happen to us if we don't move and quickly.

24
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:16,998
But I can't move, Doctor!

25
00:04:17,234 --> 00:04:18,465
Neither can I.

26
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:21,965
Wait a minute. I can move one arm.

27
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:24,851
But I can't move away!

28
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:09,933
Oh Doctor! Can't you do anything to stop it?

29
00:05:10,273 --> 00:05:10,951
No.

30
00:05:12,117 --> 00:05:18,815
Wait. One thing. It's a long chance but it just might work. Have you got a mirror in that bag?

31
00:05:19,037 --> 00:05:19,653
Yes.

32
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:20,612
Let's see.

33
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:23,856
Yes, that'll do. Hand it to me.

34
00:05:24,194 --> 00:05:24,933
I can't.

35
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:28,229
I can't move my hand. Jamie, can you take it?

36
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,599
Have you got it?

37
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:31,409
No, careful!

38
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:32,332
Take it!

39
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,024
Got it!

40
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:37,347
Right now, see if you can point it at that laser gun.

41
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:38,137
Hey?

42
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:44,698
Well, if you can reflect the light back, we've got a chance.

43
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:48,016
Can't you prop it up on something?

44
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,663
No, it won't work. I'll... I'll have to hold it.

45
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:52,284
But your... your hand.

46
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:54,039
It's a risk I'll have to take.

47
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:00,509
Quick Jamie! Now!

48
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:06,167
Oh, well done!

49
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:12,042
Why... I can move!

50
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:14,251
I... I wonder if...

51
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:17,081
Do you think that's what happened to Ben and Polly, Doctor?

52
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:18,350
No.

53
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:19,793
Are you sure?

54
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,449
I think they were needed for some purpose.

55
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:23,808
We weren't.

56
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:25,899
We were obviously too dangerous for them.

57
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:29,928
But to try and do something like this, in broad daylight!

58
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:38,980
Yes. That means only one thing, I'm afraid. Their plans are almost complete. We'll have to act fast if we're going to save Polly and Ben.

59
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:41,490
And Brian, or have you forgotten about him.

60
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:45,426
No, I've not forgotten him Sam, but if my guess is right, they're all in the same place.

61
00:06:45,758 --> 00:06:46,709
And where's that?

62
00:06:46,903 --> 00:06:50,975
I don't know. Wait! The first aid post!

63
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:51,936
Hey?

64
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:55,070
We saw a first aid post on that monitor.

65
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:55,978
Aye.

66
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,090
We must find it.

67
00:06:57,828 --> 00:06:59,686
Come on, you're not going to sit there all day are you?

68
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:04,997
Just a minute. We can't all go down to the Medical Unit.

69
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,742
All right. What can I do?

70
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,219
Did you get a good look at the man who tried to kill us?

71
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,287
I'll say. I had my arms around his neck.

72
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:14,811
Go down to the Chameleon Kiosk and see if he comes in or out.

73
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,628
Right!

74
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:17,767
But be careful. Don't let him see you.

75
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:21,572
Me be careful!? You two watch out for yourselves! I'll be OK!

76
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,653
She's got a lot of courage, that wee lass, Doctor.

77
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,607
Yes. I just hope she doesn't try to be too adventurous.

78
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,715
Who are you?

79
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:49,611
Steven Christopher Jenkins

80
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,116
Where do you live?

81
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,361
With my parents in Wimbledon.

82
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,294
Employment?

83
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:58,862
I'm an Immigration Officer, at Gatwick Airport.

84
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:09,160
Come along, easy. You'll be all right. Now come along, take it easy. We'll have you as right as rain in a minute. Now just get you down here. There we are.

85
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:11,646
Splendid.

86
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:12,856
How am I doing, Doctor?

87
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:14,249
Very well but don't over do it.

88
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:18,241
Yes, this is the room. We see... saw on the TV monitor.

89
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:24,853
If the tablets do not help, come and see me again.

90
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:27,916
What's the matter with him?

91
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:36,643
It's a rare tropical disease, Nurse. I'm his doctor. If he... if he doesn't rally soon we shall err... we shall have to use somnalin.

92
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:37,693
Somnalin?

93
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:42,694
Yes... yes, somnalin. I shall have to get him somewhere to lie down. Umm...

94
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:46,969
Oh yes, this will do nicely.

95
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:48,430
I... I'm afraid you can't go there.

96
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:52,107
Why not? It's just an X-ray room, isn't it? Isn't that a couch behind the screen.

97
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:55,962
I'm sorry, Doctor. You can't take your patient in there.

98
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,987
You refuse to help my patient?

99
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:02,396
Oh, it's not that. I have someone coming for an X-ray.

100
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:05,189
Oh I see. Well why didn't you tell me in the first place.

101
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,184
Let's get you out of here.

102
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:17,760
That Doctor is a menace to our plans.

103
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,376
Then we must kill him.

104
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,790
I tried. He must have escaped.

105
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,466
They won't escape me.

106
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,476
No, wait. This time, let them to come to us.

107
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:41,382
I've been paging him, Superintendent, but he hasn't responded.

108
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:44,251
Yes, very well sir. I'll keep on trying.

109
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:51,304
Operator. Look, I booked a call through to Athens, now what happened?

110
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,865
Yes, very well, I'll stay near the phone.

111
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,176
What's all this about?

112
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,531
Oh Doctor, have you seen Inspector Crossland?

113
00:09:58,789 --> 00:09:59,814
Well no. Why?

114
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:03,712
Well, Scotland Yard are looking for him and we can't find him anywhere. Also, your Miss Briggs wants to see you.

115
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,918
But I told her to... Where is she now?

116
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,405
Well she said something about going to the Chameleon Kiosk.

117
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:14,405
Go down and join her, Jamie. She's a very strong headed young woman. See she doesn't come to any trouble.

118
00:10:14,695 --> 00:10:16,193
I'll keep an eye on her, Doctor.

119
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:25,598
Commandant, did the Inspector say where he was going?

120
00:10:26,214 --> 00:10:30,457
Hmm, oh he said he was going to make some enquires about Chameleon Tours.

121
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:32,338
And now he's disappeared?

122
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:34,453
Aren't you rather jumping to conclusions?

123
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:43,131
I don't think so. My two friends became involved with Chameleon Tours, and they've both disappeared. However, you know what I think wh... that's happened.

124
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:48,914
Yes, and you know what I think about your ridiculous theory. People from outer space, indeed.

125
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:52,131
Something the matter with you?

126
00:10:52,343 --> 00:10:55,084
Commandant, I've found out what's been happening.

127
00:10:55,682 --> 00:10:58,318
Well, that's a step in the right direction.

128
00:10:58,722 --> 00:11:04,663
Wh... what I mean is I took the liberty of phoning all the airports that ah... err... Chameleon Tours fly to. The last on my list was Athens.

129
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:06,891
B... but don't you realise the expense of phoning Ath...

130
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:11,779
Yes, I know, I'm sorry. But what I found out is - they never deliver any passengers.

131
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,620
What do you mean? Never deliver any passengers...

132
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:25,416
It's absolutely true, sir. They all say the same thing. Dubrovnik, Athens, Rome. They say they pick up young passengers to take them off to other places but... none of them ever arrive anywhere!

133
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,750
Well in that case, they must be flying these young people to some secret airfield. But why?

134
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,231
You're still thinking in Earth terms.

135
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:37,688
And I intend to go on doing so. Wh... what was the name of that Chameleon Pilot?

136
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,669
Captain Blade.

137
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:40,626
And what er... what time is the plane due back?

138
00:11:40,814 --> 00:11:41,863
About half an hour sir.

139
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:45,284
Right. After the turn-round we'll have it followed this time.

140
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:47,504
Might I have a word with you, my dear?

141
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,858
Get me the RAF Station Manston.

142
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,712
I suspect that the Medical Centre is connected with all this.

143
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,755
Medical Cen... Oh come on...

144
00:11:55,944 --> 00:12:01,669
Now please don't get like him. Oh yes, there is definitely a connection, now, I would like to get in there and have a look round.

145
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:03,448
But anyone can go in there.

146
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:09,255
But I would like to get that nurse out of the way first... Do you think that you can manage it for me?

147
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:12,700
You'll find that in order.

148
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:13,598
Ta.

149
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:16,801
He said you'd do something silly.

150
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,824
Oh yeah, what else did he say?

151
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,636
He said you were headstrong.

152
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:29,284
Oh great. Look, you can tell the Doctor he's not going to talk me out of this one, and neither are you. I'm going on the next Chameleon flight, that leaves in half a hour.

153
00:12:30,018 --> 00:12:39,198
Oh look don't you see it's the only way we can find out anything. Oh, don't worry. I'll come back and tell you all about it.

154
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:40,835
If you do come back.

155
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,731
Oh, it's only going to Rome.

156
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,923
And what makes you so sure you'll find your brother in Rome?

157
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:52,665
Oh, I don't know. But that's where he was supposed to be going. At least I'll be doing something.

158
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:55,067
Aye, but do you not realise how dangerous it is.

159
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:57,537
Look if you're scared, I'm certainly not.

160
00:12:57,841 --> 00:12:59,144
I wish the Doctor were here.

161
00:12:59,507 --> 00:13:00,300
Oh.

162
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,363
Hey, maybe I could go with you.

163
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,897
Hey, now you're talking. Do you think you can you raise the lolly?

164
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:07,983
The lolly?

165
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:12,810
The brass - the money. Look it will cost you twenty-eight quid - pounds to you.

166
00:13:13,086 --> 00:13:21,093
Oh but that's a fortune. I've never seen that much money in my life. I suppose I... I couldn't take your place?

167
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:22,476
No!

168
00:13:25,057 --> 00:13:29,396
The Doctor said it was er... no job for a wee lassie...

169
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:30,578
A wee lassie!

170
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:31,864
You can tell the Doctor...

171
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:32,858
I say goodbye.

172
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:48,250
Hey, kid! I can take care of myself, you know.

173
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:50,058
I just wanted to make sure.

174
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:59,618
Hmm. So you can arrange to have it followed. Good. Oh I'll find out. What time's the next Chameleon flight?

175
00:13:59,996 --> 00:14:01,429
1530hrs to Rome, sir.

176
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:09,938
1530hrs heading South. Right. And I'll let you know when they request permission to start up. Cheerio old man and many thanks.

177
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:16,173
Well, that's settled that. The next Chameleon flight will have an RAF fighter on its tail.

178
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:22,837
Good grief. Jean. Jean!

179
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:29,271
What's the matter with the girl? Get me the Medical Centre.

180
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:37,210
Isn't it possible for your assistant to come down here, Commandant.

181
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,944
But I'm not supposed to leave here.

182
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:47,323
All right sir, if you insist.

183
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:36,447
I'm just going off duty, but err this gentleman will be pleased to attend to you.

184
00:16:41,297 --> 00:16:42,379
How do you feel now?

185
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:43,471
Not too good.

186
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:46,887
I can't understand it. She's never done this on me before.

187
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:53,937
Thank you Nurse. I feel much better now.

188
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:56,056
Well there couldn't be much wrong then.

189
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,406
Have you had any lunch?

190
00:16:57,654 --> 00:17:00,530
No I've been so busy today, I haven't even had any breakfast.

191
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:07,683
Then no wonder you didn't feel well. Really Commandant. You must see that your staff have time for regular meals.

192
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:10,303
I've never stopped her having her lunch!

193
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:14,663
I'm sure, Commandant. But it has been known to happen.

194
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:18,449
Now look here.

195
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:19,451
Very well done!

196
00:17:19,643 --> 00:17:20,592
Did I give you enough time?

197
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:21,680
Ample time.

198
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:24,260
What is all this? You weren't ill at all, were you?

199
00:17:24,556 --> 00:17:27,150
It's all right, Commandant. She was acting on my instructions.

200
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:28,855
On your instructions?

201
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,653
Yes. What do you think of these?

202
00:17:31,873 --> 00:17:33,273
Now, what are these?

203
00:17:33,448 --> 00:17:35,749
I think there's somebody here who can tell us.

204
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,283
Excuse me.

205
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:48,333
Where's the chap who usually sits there?

206
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:52,757
Well he's probably off duty. In that case, he'll be back on shift in a couple of hours.

207
00:17:53,004 --> 00:17:56,696
I see. Oh well, these'll have to wait.

208
00:18:00,282 --> 00:18:08,778
Chameleon Youth Tours announce the departure of their flight number Four-One-Nine to Rome. Will all passengers please assemble in the departure lounge.

209
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:14,725
Don't forget your postcards. Give them back to me and we'll post them for you when...

210
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,880
Have you found your ticket yet?

211
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:22,748
I don't know. I seem to have lost it somewhere. But you remember me, don't you? I bought it off you.

212
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:25,066
There are so many people... what was the name?

213
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,159
Err, Samantha Briggs. Oh, it had S. Briggs on the ticket.

214
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:31,258
S. Briggs has already checked in.

215
00:18:31,507 --> 00:18:36,131
Oh no. Well, who the heck... Look, can you remember what she looked like?

216
00:18:36,311 --> 00:18:39,012
She? I seem to remember a boy with that ticket.

217
00:18:39,224 --> 00:18:42,161
Jamie! He's pinched it. Look you have to stop him!

218
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:43,994
I can't hold up the flight.

219
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:45,027
But look.

220
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:47,586
I'm sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you.

221
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:56,669
Hello. Yes, all right. That's very kind of you.

222
00:18:57,112 --> 00:18:59,864
You're very fortunate. Your ticket's just been found.

223
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,632
Oh good. Well who got it?

224
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,382
We can't tell you that I'm afraid but our manager would like to see you. He's just through there.

225
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:08,131
Oh right, ta.

226
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:13,223
Now, who's got their postcards ready?

227
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:17,256
Er, you wanted to see me?

228
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:21,636
Yes, indeed. You won't escape again!

229
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:46,319
Chameleon Four-One-Nine. Clearance correct.

230
00:19:46,961 --> 00:19:49,336
Chameleon Four-One-Nine. Taxi Clearance?

231
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:55,042
Chameleon Four-One-Nine. Taxi following southern taxiway for departure runway two-seven.

232
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:56,402
Roger.

233
00:19:57,068 --> 00:20:00,117
Well this time they'll have the RAF on their tail!

234
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:04,201
How high can fighters go these days, Commandant?

235
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:05,986
Oh, ten miles plus.

236
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:07,837
How futile.

237
00:20:29,884 --> 00:20:31,479
RAF Manston, sir.

238
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:45,105
Oh, good. Hello, old boy. The Chameleon Rome flight's just taken off. They're on Amber One, at flight level two-one-zero. Right. Good man.

239
00:20:58,703 --> 00:21:02,577
You can unfasten your seat belts now. Thank you.

240
00:21:06,171 --> 00:21:07,465
Are you all right?

241
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:09,594
Oh aye, I'll be all right.

242
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:10,757
Good.

243
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:23,853
That's the fifty-mile mark they're passing now.

244
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,656
Normally you... you don't plot them at this range?

245
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:31,522
No, there's too much traffic to control. Once they're up and away on their air corridor, we're finished with them.

246
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:36,221
Hello, Gatwick Airport. This is RAF Two-Four-One. How do you read me?

247
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,585
Gatwick Airport to RAF Two-Four-One. We read you loud and clear.

248
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:45,563
Have the Chameleon aircraft in sight. Am following at ten thousand feet, heading due south.

249
00:21:46,235 --> 00:21:50,374
That's him. Right on the tail. So far so good!

250
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:00,949
All set.

251
00:22:04,037 --> 00:22:05,415
Something's following us.

252
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:08,410
Another airliner going the same way?

253
00:22:08,903 --> 00:22:10,238
No, it's too small.

254
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:20,215
It's a fighter. Give me a radar reading.

255
00:22:21,271 --> 00:22:23,919
Two-three decimal seven-nine.

256
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,134
Heslington, that fighter's off course!

257
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,734
Gatwick to RAF Two-Four-One. Do you read me?

258
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:43,731
That plane isn't just off course. Something's happened to it.

259
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:48,106
You're right. It's out of control. Gatwick to RAF Two-Four-One. Do you read me?

260
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:50,735
I don't think you'll get a reply.

261
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:56,973
It's fading, dropping out of our radar. Jean, get me RAF Manston. That plane's crashed.

262
00:22:57,204 --> 00:22:59,542
Look at the Chameleon plane! There's something wrong with that too.

263
00:22:59,823 --> 00:23:00,462
Hmmm?

264
00:23:00,638 --> 00:23:01,854
It's standing still!

265
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:02,868
Impossible.

266
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:04,327
No sir, the blip's stationary.

267
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,843
That can only mean one thing... It's crashing too!

268
00:23:44,263 --> 00:23:47,144
Report to the flight deck immediately.

269
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,201
How many people require passports in order to leave the airport on the next flight.

270
00:23:57,409 --> 00:23:58,585
Twenty-Five.

271
00:24:00,336 --> 00:24:02,105
You missed this one here.

272
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,304
I'm sorry.

273
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:07,325
Carry on.

274
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:20,940
Negative report from Air Sea Rescue, sir.

275
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:24,529
But with two aircraft ditching there must be some signs of wreckage.

276
00:24:24,698 --> 00:24:27,936
Why do you think the Chameleon plane crashed into the sea?

277
00:24:28,116 --> 00:24:30,575
Because it disappeared off our radar screen!

278
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:32,416
But it stood still first!

279
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,904
Because it must have collided with the RAF plane and dropped like a stone.

280
00:24:36,043 --> 00:24:37,009
Why do you think that?

281
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:44,725
You see, when a plane on that radar appears to stand still, it is in point of fact dropping straight down.

282
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:46,431
What about straight up?

283
00:24:46,657 --> 00:24:58,050
Oh my dear Doctor! To get above our radar umbrella like that it'd have to climb vertically until it was a hundred miles high. The darned thing would be in outer space.

284
00:24:58,461 --> 00:24:59,725
Exactly!
