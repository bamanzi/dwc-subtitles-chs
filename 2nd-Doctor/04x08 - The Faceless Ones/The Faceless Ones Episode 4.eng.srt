1
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:20,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,810
- All set.   - Good.

3
00:00:52,672 --> 00:00:56,192
You wanted to know the secret of Chameleon Tours. 

4
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,128
Well Inspector,

5
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:04,960
see for yourself!

6
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,784
- Doctor!   - He's dead!

7
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:23,440
You're coming with me.

8
00:01:23,504 --> 00:01:24,768
I'll not leave him.

9
00:01:24,928 --> 00:01:26,944
You have five seconds to change your mind.

10
00:01:27,024 --> 00:01:28,416
You'll have to kill me then.

11
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,416
I said five seconds.

12
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,416
Five, four, three...

13
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:35,760
SAMANTHA!

14
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,700
I suppose there's no use my asking where this plane's going to?

15
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,390
You will know soon enough.

16
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,936
This is Plane Number Three to Base.

17
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,728
Inform the Director that I have an original for him as ordered.

18
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:53,767
I am delivering him now,

19
00:02:54,096 --> 00:02:57,104
and will return immediately to Gatwick Airport.

20
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:01,264
Jamie? Are you all right?

21
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:05,480
Aye. Th... They've not harmed you, have they?

22
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,310
No - but I can't move.

23
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:12,000
Doctor?

24
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:13,888
Are you all right?

25
00:03:13,952 --> 00:03:15,892
What's happening? I... I can't move.

26
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:18,112
What's that?

27
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:22,096
I... I don't know. It's a beam of light.

28
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,168
Aye. Doctor, it... it's moving towards us!

29
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:33,616
That's just a small fore-taste of what'll happen to us
 if we don't move and quickly.

30
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,432
- But I can't move, Doctor!  - Neither can I.

31
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,288
Wait a minute. I can move one arm.

32
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:42,640
But I can't move away!

33
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,592
Oh Doctor! Can't you do anything to stop it?

34
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,856
No.

35
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:14,480
Wait. One thing.

36
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,008
It's a long chance but it just might work. 

37
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,400
Have you got a mirror in that bag?

38
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,368
- Yes.   - Let's see.

39
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:23,104
Yes, that'll do. Hand it to me.

40
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:26,128
- I can't.  - I can't move my hand.

41
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,470
Jamie, can you take it?

42
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:30,880
- Have you got it?   - No, careful!

43
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,784
- Take it!   - Got it!

44
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,888
Right now, see if you can point it at that laser gun.

45
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:39,584
- That thing on the wall.  
 - I'll try, Doctor. But why? 

46
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:42,816
If you can reflect the light back, we've got a chance.

47
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,256
Can't you prop it up on something?

48
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:48,496
- No, it won't work. I'll... I'll have to hold it.  
- But your...

49
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,632
- Your hand!  - It's a risk I'll have to take.

50
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,650
Quick Jamie! Now!

51
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:00,310
Oh, well done!

52
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:05,344
Why... I can move!

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,296
I... I wonder if...

54
00:05:07,552 --> 00:05:10,592
Do you think that's what happened to Ben and Polly, Doctor?

55
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:12,640
- No.   - Are you sure?

56
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:15,180
I think they were needed for some purpose.

57
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,688
- We weren't. 
- We were obviously too dangerous for them.

58
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,256
But to try and do something like this, in broad daylight!

59
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,232
Yes. That means only one thing, I'm afraid.

60
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,048
Their plans are almost complete.

61
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,672
We'll have to act fast if we're going to save Polly and Ben.

62
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:33,240
And Brian, or have you forgotten about him.

63
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,912
No, I've not forgotten him Sam,

64
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:37,170
but if my guess is right, they're all in the same place.

65
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,184
- And where's that?  - I don't know.

66
00:05:39,248 --> 00:05:42,320
Wait! The first aid post!

67
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:45,600
We saw a first aid post on that monitor.

68
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,312
We must find it.

69
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:50,384
Come on, you're not going to sit there all day are you?

70
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,528
Just a minute. We can't all go down to the Medical Unit.

71
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,490
All right. What can I do?

72
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,592
Did you get a good look at the man who tried to kill us?

73
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,768
I'll say. I had my arms around his neck.

74
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:03,760
Go down to the Chameleon Kiosk and see if he comes in or out.

75
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,368
- Right!  - But be careful. Don't let him see you.

76
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:10,912
Me be careful!? You two watch out for yourselves! I'll be OK!

77
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:14,912
She's got a lot of courage, that wee lass, Doctor.

78
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:19,152
Yes. I just hope she doesn't try to be too adventurous.

79
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,660
Who are you?

80
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,016
Steven Christopher Jenkins

81
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,248
Where do you live?

82
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,310
With my parents in Wimbledon.

83
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,240
Employment?

84
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:34,432
I'm an Immigration Officer, at Gatwick Airport.

85
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,984
Come along, easy. You'll be all right.

86
00:06:37,984 --> 00:06:39,568
Now come along, take it easy.

87
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,360
We'll have you as right as rain in a minute.

88
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:44,208
Now just get you down here. There we are.

89
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:47,328
- Splendid.   - How am I doing, Doctor?

90
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:49,392
Very well but don't over do it.

91
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:52,672
Yes, this is the room. We see... saw on the TV monitor.

92
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:58,224
If the tablets do not help, come and see me again.

93
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,920
- What's the matter with him?
- It's a rare tropical disease,

94
00:07:01,952 --> 00:07:02,990
Nurse. I'm his doctor.

95
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:09,152
If he... if he doesn't rally soon we shall err... 
we shall have to use somnalin.

96
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:11,600
- Somnalin?  - Yes... yes, somnalin

97
00:07:11,888 --> 00:07:15,680
So l have to get him somewhere to lie down. Umm...

98
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,096
- Oh yes, this will do nicely.  
 - I... I'm afraid you can't go there.

99
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:23,580
Why not? It's just an X-ray room, isn't it?
 Isn't that a couch behind the screen.

100
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,040
I'm sorry, Doctor. You can't take your patient in there.

101
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,288
- You refuse to help my patient?  - Oh, it's not that.

102
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:33,984
- I have someone coming for an X-ray.  - Oh I see.

103
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:36,430
Well why didn't you tell me in the first place.

104
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,344
<i>Let's get you out of here.</i>

105
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,920
That Doctor is a menace to our plans.

106
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,420
Then we must kill him.

107
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:51,680
I tried. He must have escaped.

108
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:53,840
- They won't escape me.  - No, wait.

109
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:57,952
This time, let them to come to us.

110
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,030
I've been paging him, Superintendent, but he hasn't responded.

111
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:09,728
Yes, very well sir. I'll keep on trying.

112
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:16,528
Operator. Look, I booked a call through
 to Athens, now what happened?

113
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,610
Yes, very well, I'll stay near the phone.

114
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:20,432
What's all this about?

115
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,064
- Oh Doctor, have you seen Inspector Crossland?   - Well no. Why?

116
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,320
Well, Scotland Yard are looking for him
 and we can't find him anywhere.

117
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:28,080
Also, your Miss Briggs wants to see you.

118
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:30,848
But I told her to... Where is she now?

119
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,944
Well she said something about going to the Chameleon Kiosk.

120
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,672
Go down and join her, Jamie. 
She's a very strong headed young woman.

121
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,536
- See she doesn't come to any trouble. 
- I'll keep an eye on her, Doctor.

122
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,320
Commandant, did the Inspector say where he was going?

123
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:52,528
Hmm, oh he said he was going to make some enquires about Chameleon Tours.

124
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,672
And now he's disappeared?

125
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,904
- Aren't you rather jumping to conclusions?
- I don't think so.

126
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,160
My two friends became involved with Chameleon Tours, 
and they've both disappeared.

127
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,020
However, you know what I think wh... that's happened.

128
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:08,432
Yes, and you know what I think about your ridiculous theory.

129
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:11,024
People from outer space, indeed.

130
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:13,232
Something the matter with you?

131
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,128
Commandant, I've found out what's been happening.

132
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,400
Well, that's a step in the right direction.

133
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,136
Wh... what I mean is, I took the liberty of phoning all the airports

134
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:23,184
that ah... err... Chameleon Tours fly to.

135
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:24,720
The last on my list was Athens.

136
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:27,136
- Don't you realise the expense of phoning Ath... 
- Yes, I know, I'm sorry.

137
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:31,504
But what I found out is - they never deliver any passengers.

138
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:34,272
What do you mean? Never deliver any passengers...

139
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,880
It's absolutely true, sir. They all say the same thing.

140
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,432
Dubrovnik, Athens, Rome.

141
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,696
They say they pick up young passengers 
to take them off to other places but...

142
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,570
none of them ever arrive anywhere!

143
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,776
Well in that case, they must be flying
 these young people to some secret airfield. But why?

144
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:54,160
- You're still thinking in Earth terms. 
- And I intend to go on doing so.

145
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,864
- Wh... what was the name of that Chameleon Pilot? 
- Captain Blade.

146
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:59,568
- And what er... what time is the plane due back? 
- About half an hour, sir.

147
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:02,688
Right. After the turn-round we'll have it followed this time.

148
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:05,072
Could I have a word with you, my dear?

149
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,232
Get me the RAF Station Manston.

150
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:11,120
I suspect that the Medical Centre is connected with all this.

151
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:14,144
- Medical Cen... Oh come on...  
- Now please don't get like him.

152
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:16,172
Oh yes, there is definitely a connection,

153
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,730
now, I would like to get in there and have a look round.

154
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:20,112
But anyone can go in there.

155
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,056
But I would like to get that nurse out of the way first...

156
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,840
Do you think that you can manage it for me?

157
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:29,872
You'll find that in order.

158
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:32,592
He said you'd do something silly.

159
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:34,512
Oh yeah, what else did he say?

160
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,624
- He said you were headstrong.
- Oh great. Look, you can tell the Doctor

161
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:40,992
he's not going to talk me out of this one, and neither are you.

162
00:10:41,152 --> 00:10:44,380
I'm going on the next Chameleon flight,
 that leaves in half a hour.

163
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,072
Oh look don't you see, it's the only way 
we can find out anything.

164
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,744
Oh, don't worry. I'll come back and tell you all about it.

165
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,152
- If you do come back. 
- Oh, it's only going to Rome.

166
00:10:57,264 --> 00:11:00,240
And what makes you so sure 
you'll find your brother in Rome?

167
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,320
Oh, I don't know. But that's where he was supposed to be going.

168
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:08,496
- At least I'll be doing something. 
- Aye, but do you not realise how dangerous it is.

169
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:10,784
Look if you're scared, I'm certainly not.

170
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,024
- I wish the Doctor were here. 
- Oh.

171
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:15,510
Hey, maybe I could go with you.

172
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,288
Hey, now you're talking. Do you think you can you raise the lolly?

173
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:20,864
- The lolly? 
 - The brass - the money.

174
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:23,968
Look it will cost you twenty-eight quid - pounds to you.

175
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,904
Oh but that's a fortune. I've never seen that much money in my life. 

176
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:32,448
- I suppose I... I couldn't take your place?
-  No!

177
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:39,424
The Doctor said it was er... no job for a wee lassie...

178
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:43,104
- A wee lassie! You can tell the Doctor... 
- I say goodbye.

179
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:49,648
Hey, kid! I can take care of myself, you know.

180
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,616
I just wanted to make sure.

181
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,627
Hmm. So you can arrange to have it followed. 

182
00:11:56,064 --> 00:12:00,128
Good. Oh I'll find out. What time's the next Chameleon flight?

183
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,616
1530hrs to Rome, sir.

184
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,096
1530hrs heading South.

185
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:07,776
Right. And I'll let you know when they request permission to start up.

186
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,190
Cheerio old man and many thanks.

187
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,816
Well, that's settled that.

188
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:16,000
The next Chameleon flight will have an RAF fighter on its tail.

189
00:12:17,616 --> 00:12:22,896
Good grief. Jean. Jean!

190
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,048
What's the matter with the girl? Get me the Medical Centre.

191
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,360
Isn't it possible for your assistant to come down here, Commandant.

192
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,216
But I'm not supposed to leave here.

193
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,968
All right sir, if you insist.

194
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:38,864
I'm just going off duty, 

195
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,590
but err this gentleman will be pleased to attend to you.

196
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,440
- How do you feel now? 
  - Not too good.

197
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:52,780
I can't understand it. 
She's never done this on me before.

198
00:13:57,216 --> 00:13:59,328
Thank you Nurse. I feel much better now.

199
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,216
Well there couldn't be much wrong then.

200
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:02,528
Have you had any lunch?

201
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,328
No I've been so busy today, I haven't even had any breakfast.

202
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:07,578
Then no wonder you didn't feel well.

203
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,200
Really Commandant. You must see that 
your staff have time for regular meals.

204
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:14,800
I've never stopped her having her lunch!

205
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,656
I'm sure, Commandant. 
But it has been known to happen.

206
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:23,040
- Now look here.   - Very well done!

207
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,960
- Did I give you enough time? - Ample time.

208
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,488
What is all this? You weren't ill at all, were you?

209
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:30,400
It's all right, Commandant. 
She was acting on my instructions.

210
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,544
- On your instructions? - Yes. What do you think of these?

211
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,080
Now, what are these?

212
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,624
I think there's somebody here who can tell us.

213
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,430
Excuse me.

214
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,000
Where's the chap who usually sits there?

215
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:51,568
Well he's probably off duty.

216
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:54,352
In that case, he'll be back on shift in a couple of hours.

217
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,808
I see. Oh well, these'll have to wait.

218
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,346
Chameleon Youth Tours announce the departure

219
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,920
of their flight number Four-One-Nine to Rome.

220
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:08,320
Will all passengers please assemble in the departure lounge.

221
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,016
Don't forget your postcards. 

222
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:14,270
Give them back to me and we'll post them for you when...

223
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:17,430
Have you found your ticket yet?

224
00:15:17,504 --> 00:15:19,568
I don't know. I seem to have lost it somewhere.

225
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,680
But you remember me, don't you? I bought it off you.

226
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,900
There are so many people... what was the name?

227
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:27,648
Err, Samantha Briggs. Oh, it had S. Briggs on the ticket.

228
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:29,600
S. Briggs has already checked in.

229
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,016
Oh no. Well, who the heck...

230
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,640
Look, can you remember what she looked like?

231
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:36,560
She? I seem to remember a boy with that ticket.

232
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:39,792
Jamie! He's pinched it. Look you have to stop him!

233
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,540
I can't hold up the flight.

234
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:45,130
- But look...  - I'm sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you.

235
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:47,936
Hello.

236
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:52,160
Yes, all right. That's very kind of you.

237
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:56,256
You're very fortunate. 
Your ticket's just been found.

238
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,872
- Oh good. Well who got it?
- We can't tell you that I'm afraid.

239
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:02,560
but our manager would like to see you. He's just through there.

240
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,180
Oh right, ta.

241
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:08,896
Now, who's got their postcards ready?

242
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,616
- Er, you wanted to see me?  - Yes, indeed. 

243
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,896
You won't escape again!

244
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,960
Chameleon Four-One-Nine. Clearance correct.

245
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,980
Chameleon Four-One-Nine. Taxi Clearance?

246
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,872
Chameleon Four-One-Nine. Taxi following southern taxiway

247
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:35,472
- for departure runway two-seven. - Roger.

248
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:38,304
Well this time they'll have the RAF on their tail!

249
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:41,456
How high can fighters go these days, Commandant?

250
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,560
- Oh, ten miles plus. - How futile.

251
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,160
- RAF Manston, sir.  - Oh, good.

252
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:56,848
Hello, old boy. The Chameleon Rome flight's just taken off.

253
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,096
They're on Amber One, at flight level two-one-zero.

254
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:04,970
Right. Good man.

255
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:08,400
You can unfasten your seat belts now. Thank you.

256
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:09,696
Are you all right?

257
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,480
- Oh aye, I'll be all right. - Good.

258
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,200
That's the fifty-mile mark they're passing now.

259
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,472
Normally you... you don't plot them at this range?

260
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,024
No, there's too much traffic to control.

261
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:32,080
Once they're up and away on their air corridor, we're finished with them.

262
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,752
Hello, Gatwick Airport. This is RAF Two-Four-One. How do you read me?

263
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,672
Gatwick Airport to RAF Two-Four-One. We read you loud and clear.

264
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:42,624
Have the Chameleon aircraft in sight.

265
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:45,376
Am following at ten thousand feet, heading due south.

266
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,064
That's him. Right on the tail. So far so good!

267
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,400
All set.

268
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,960
Something's following us.

269
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,520
Another airliner going the same way?

270
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,780
No, it's too small.

271
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:12,320
It's a fighter. Give me a radar reading.

272
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:15,744
Two-three decimal seven-nine.

273
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:27,392
Heslington, that fighter's off course!

274
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,780
Gatwick to RAF Two-Four-One. Do you read me?

275
00:18:31,616 --> 00:18:33,456
That plane isn't just off course.

276
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:35,600
- Something's happened to it.  
- You're right. It's out of control. 

277
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,864
Gatwick to RAF Two-Four-One. Do you read me?

278
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:42,830
- I don't think you'll get a reply. 
- It's fading, dropping out of our radar.

279
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,560
 Jean, get me RAF Manston. That plane's crashed.

280
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:49,136
Look at the Chameleon plane! 
There's something wrong with that too.

281
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:49,776
Hmmm?

282
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:51,696
It's standing still! Impossible.

283
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,392
No sir, the blip's stationary.

284
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,152
That can only mean one thing...

285
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:58,390
It's crashing too!

286
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,560
Report to the flight deck immediately.

287
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,112
How many people require passports 
in order to leave the airport on the next flight.

288
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,912
- Twenty-Five. 
- You missed this one here.

289
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:32,864
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,200
Carry on.

291
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,290
Negative report from Air Sea Rescue, sir.

292
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,696
But with two aircraft ditching there must be some signs of wreckage.

293
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:54,730
Why do you think the Chameleon plane crashed into the sea?

294
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,264
Because it disappeared off our radar screen!

295
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:58,576
But it stood still first!

296
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:01,616
Because it must have collided with the RAF plane 
and dropped like a stone.

297
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:03,488
Why do you think that?

298
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,664
You see, when a plane on that radar appears to stand still,

299
00:20:07,712 --> 00:20:10,352
it is in point of fact dropping straight down.

300
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,832
- What about straight up?
- Oh my dear Doctor!

301
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,712
To get above our radar umbrella like that

302
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:19,568
it'd have to climb vertically until it was a hundred miles high.

303
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,224
The darned thing would be in outer space.

304
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:23,664
Exactly!
