1
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,380
是只飞兽!
It's a flying beastie!

2
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,320
嘿, 你们, 站住!
Hey, you! Stop!

3
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,240
散开!
Scatter!

4
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,640
- 飞行员说了什么?   - 跑道上有个警察亭
- The pilot said what?
- A police box on the runway.

5
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,765
说得跟真的似的! 让他回到排队区
A likely story! Tell him to get back into stack

6
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
等待下一步安排
and await further instructions.

7
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,720
Rock 小姐, 接机场警局
Miss Rock, get the airport police.

8
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,760
塔台呼叫SDX
Control. Sugar Delta X-ray.

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,590
请返回排队区
Return to stack.

10
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,750
警局吗? 我是总指挥
Police? Commandant here.

11
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:56,950
入港航班报告说有障碍物
In-bound aircraft reports obstruction

12
00:01:57,024 --> 00:01:59,600
说是在第五和第二跑道的交界处
on intersection of runways five and two.

13
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:01,616
去调查一下, 汇报情况
Investigate and report back.

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,710
警察亭子
Police box.

15
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,980
Jamie! 到我这里来
Jamie! Come over here with me.

16
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,840
快来
Come on.

17
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,840
等一下
Just a minute.

18
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,920
把那信封给我
Give me that envelope!

19
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,520
我建议你站住
I would advise you to stop.

20
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,030
啊!
Agh!

21
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,160
你能快点过来吗? 有麻烦了
Can you come quickly? Trouble.

22
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,310
麻烦? 发生什么事了?
<i>Trouble? What happened?</i>

23
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,950
那些明信片, 有人发现了
The postcards. Someone found them.

24
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,680
就来
<i>Right.</i>

25
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:22,736
行了, 行了
All right, all right.

26
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,144
那你们是把它卸在四号机库了, 是个什么东西?
So you dumped it by number four hangar,
but what was it?

27
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,184
还真是个警察亭子?
It WAS a police box?

28
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,760
给我接警察局长
Get me the police chief.

29
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
好了, 你可以安排那些飞机降落了
All right. You can bring those planes down now.

30
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,760
- 障碍已经被清除了  - 好的, 先生
- The obstruction's been cleared. - Right, sir.

31
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,940
你觉得这是不是一个恶作剧, 先生? 学生什么的?
Do you think it was a practical joke, sir?
Students or someone?

32
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,120
不管他是谁, 一旦被我抓到了, 有他们好果子吃
Well, whoever it was, they'll pay for it
when I get my hands on them.

33
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,800
我可不能让这些恶作剧什么的威胁到乘客的安全
I won't have passengers' lives
endangered by practical jokers or anyone else.

34
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,500
Reynolds 警司吗? 我让总指挥接您电话
Superintendent Reynolds?
I have the commandant for you.

35
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,820
警局总长
The Chief of Police.

36
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,620
听着, 跑道上的警察亭子都是怎么一回事?
Listen, what's all this
about a police box on the runway?

37
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,480
哦...好吧, 各处的安保工作必须加强!
Oh. Well, security's got to be tightened up all round!

38
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,440
他报告说有人看到四个嫌疑人从那个亭子四散跑开
He reports that four suspects
were seen running away from it.

39
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,920
- 那抓到了他们吗?   - 没有!
- Did they catch them?  - No!

40
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,840
这警察够笨的, 给跟丢了, 这会儿都跑出八百里远了
Idiot of a policeman lost them.
They're miles away by now.

41
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,430
给我接出入境检查站
Get me Immigration.

42
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:22,150
跟他们说我想知道有没有人看到些可疑人员
Tell them to let me know
if any suspicious characters are seen there.

43
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,680
- Polly 在那儿!   - Polly! 这边来!
- There's Polly!  - Polly! Over here!

44
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,030
博士...
Doctor...

45
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,480
我刚刚看到有人被害了!
I've just seen a man killed!

46
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,920
- 被一个飞兽给撞了?   - 不是
- Hit by one of the beasties?  - No.

47
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,300
刚才那里面有两个人
There were two men in there.

48
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,800
其中一个手里有枪, 他开枪杀了另外一个
One of them had a gun,
and he shot the other one.

49
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,540
那个凶手, 他看到你了吗?
The murderer, did he see you?

50
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,040
他还追我, 但我设法甩掉了
He chased me but I managed to lose him.

51
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,560
你还能找到那个机库吗?
Could you find this hangar again?

52
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,400
这, 我觉得能...
Well, I think so...

53
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,680
我还记得名字, 好像叫变色龙什么的
I can remember the name.
It was Chameleon something or other.

54
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,628
- Ben 去哪儿了?  - 我们没看见他
- Where's Ben? - We haven't seen him.

55
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,980
快点, 我们去找这个机库
Come on, let's find this hangar.

56
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,840
但是, 那个有枪的家伙还会找我
But, the bloke with the gun will be looking for me.

57
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,280
我们会照顾你的, 来, 快点
We'll look after you. Now, come on.

58
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,460
不过..Ben 怎么办?
Where's...What about Ben?

59
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,120
- 他发现了那些明信片  - 他叫什么名字?
- He found the postcards.  - His name?

60
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,620
我不知道. 我在办公室逮住他的
I don't know. I caught him in the office.

61
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,660
他已经发现了证据, 我不得不阻止他
He'd found evidence. I had to stop him.

62
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,200
你杀死的是 Gascoigne 督察, 是个警察
You've killed Detective Inspector Gascoigne -
a policeman.

63
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,191
你觉得他上面有人派他来的?
Do you think a parent sent him?

64
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:59,200
很有可能. 不过没关系
Possibly. It doesn't matter.

65
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,020
重要的是没人会找到他
The important thing is that nobody should find him.

66
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,940
安排人处理掉吧
Arrange disposal.

67
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,990
好了, 尽快搞定这事
All right. Get it over here as quickly as possible.

68
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,310
- 箱子已经在来的路上了  - 好
- A container is on the way.  - Right.

69
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,470
销毁这个
Destroy this.

70
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,110
你为什么把那些行李箱留在这里?
Why have you left those suitcases there?

71
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,720
那个侦探 - 我被他打断了
The detective - he interrupted me.

72
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,320
Spencer!
Spencer!

73
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,470
看
<i>Look.</i>

74
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,710
那家伙是从那个门里出来的
<i>The bloke came out of that door there.</i>

75
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,560
被锁住了吗? 里面有人吗?
<i>Is it locked? Is anyone in there?</i>

76
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,240
是锁住的, 里面没有人
<i>It's locked. There's nobody there.</i>

77
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,590
Polly, 那个开枪杀他的家伙...
Polly, this man who killed him...

78
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,500
你还能认出他来吗?
Would you recognise him again?

79
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,550
能! 他还追我, 我怎么都能认出他来
Yes! He chased me. I'd recognise him anywhere.

80
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,280
愚蠢!
Fool!

81
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,440
Polly, 你说说他是怎么被杀的?
Polly, how would you say he was killed?

82
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,470
用的是枪
With a gun.

83
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,630
你能给我描述一下吗?
Can you describe it to me?

84
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,980
不能, 太远了. 为什么?
No. It was too far away. Why?

85
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,030
这人是被电死的
This man was electrocuted.

86
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,710
他的衣服全都烧焦了
His clothes are all scorched.

87
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,030
绝对是某种枪, 博士
It was definitely some kind of a gun, Doctor.

88
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,160
也许吧, 但这种枪在这个星球上还没有研发出来
Maybe. But not one that's
been developed yet on this planet.

89
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,470
这个他们称为博士的人, 他是从哪里了解到这些的?
This man they call Doctor,
where does he get his knowledge?

90
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,180
他看起来像是一个普通人
He looks like a normal being.

91
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,220
比大多数的智力高多了
More intelligent than most.

92
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
他对我们的行动是一个威胁
He's a threat to our operation.

93
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,900
- 我去杀了他  - 不要
- I'll kill him. - No.

94
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,380
先抓那个女孩儿, 她能指认你
Get the girl. She can identify you.

95
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,540
我们可以稍后再对付这老头
We can deal with the man later.

96
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,400
- 他会说出去的  - 那又怎样?
- He may talk.  - So?

97
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,030
没人会信他的
Nobody will believe him.

98
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,847
我们必须向当局报告这个事情
We must report this to the authorities.

99
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,880
刚才那个追我们的人, 我们也许可以找到他
That man who chased us. We could find him maybe.

100
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,080
什么, 那个警察?
What, the policeman?

101
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,040
不, 不, Jamie. 我们必须找到这个地方的总负责人
No, no, Jamie, we must find
the man in charge in this place.

102
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,730
那他怎么办? 我们不能把他扔在这里
What about him? We can't just leave him here.

103
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,213
我们做不了什么了
There's nothing else we can do.

104
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:27,240
我们现在还是去找机场主楼吧, 快点
Now let's find the main airport building. Come on.

105
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,540
你确定这条路对吗, 博士?
Are you sure this is the right way, Doctor?

106
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,660
看起来是通向主楼的
It seems to lead to the main airport building.

107
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,300
- 我怎么了?   - 短暂的肌体失能
- What happened to me?  - A temporary disablement.

108
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,220
你很快就能恢复正常, 起来吧
You'll be back to normal any second now. Up here.

109
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,980
- 你要带我去哪里?   - 你马上就知道了
- Where are you taking me?  - You'll soon find out.

110
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,620
- 我抓住她了  - 非常好
- I've got her.  - Excellent.

111
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,420
这次没人看见你吧?
Did anybody see you this time?

112
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,953
她走在她朋友的后面, 他们也没注意
She was following behind her friends,
but they didn't notice.

113
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:16,580
- 他们会来找我的  - 坐下
- They'll come looking for me.  - Sit down.

114
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,370
凶手!
Murderers!

115
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,620
你必须给我们放尊重点, 回答我的问题
You'll have to show us some respect
and answer my questions.

116
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,600
- 你在那个航线上工作?   - 我没明白
- Which airline do you work for?
- I don't understand.

117
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,060
你肯定属于某条航线, 或者这里的机场管理方
You must belong to an airline
or the airport authority to be in this area.

118
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,130
我跟机场没有任何关系, 只是刚抵达这里, 迷路了
I've got nothing to do with the airport.
We'd just arrived. We were lost.

119
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,300
我正想找人帮忙, 然后就看到他杀了一个人
I was trying to find someone to help me,
and I saw him kill a man.

120
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,260
你说你们刚抵达这里? 你怎么到这里的?
You say you'd just arrived? How did you get here?

121
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,776
我们从她这里问不出什么来
We'll gain nothing by questioning her.

122
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:50,112
重要的是我们抓住了她
The important thing is that we've got her.

123
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,904
你们不会觉得我的朋友们就这样把我给忘了吧, 会吗?
You don't think my friends
are just going to forget me like that, do you?

124
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,335
我搞不懂了, 博士, 那儿都找不到 Polly
<i>I don't understand it, Doctor.
Polly's nowhere to be seen.</i>

125
00:12:00,335 --> 00:12:02,100
她肯定出什么事了
<i>Something must have happened to her.</i>

126
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,580
这里锁住的, Jamie, 里面没人
<i>That's locked, Jamie. There's nobody there.</i>

127
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,114
我担心我们是在浪费时间, Jamie
I'm afraid we're wasting our time here, Jamie.

128
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:13,890
我们越早找到当局越好, 把情况告诉他们. 快点
The sooner we find the authorities
and tell it to them, the better. Come on.

129
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,050
是的, 你说得对. 你的朋友们的确在担心你
Yes, you're right.
Your friends ARE worried about you.

130
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,980
那我们必须得做点什么, 让他们不要再担心了
Then we shall have to do something
to stop them worrying.

131
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,670
看起来是往这边, Jamie
This seems to be the way, Jamie.

132
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,190
打扰了. 我们在找这里的负责人
Excuse me. We're looking for someone in authority.

133
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,960
等一下, 先生. 都来得及的
Just a moment, sir. All in good time.

134
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,110
谢谢你, 女士
Thank you, madam.

135
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,980
好了, 先生, 请出示你们的护照
Now, sir. Your passport, please.

136
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,669
我没时间说这个, 我们要找负责人
I've got no time for that.
We want to see someone in authority.

137
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,310
我就是负责人. 请出示你的护照
I am in authority. Your passport, please.

138
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,000
你没搞明白, 我们有一些重要情况要报告
You don't understand.
We have something important to report.

139
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,480
可以, 先生, 但得等你们找到了护照再说
Yes, sir, when you've found your passport.

140
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,680
下一个, 请过来
Next one, please.

141
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,570
- 护照是什么, 博士?  - 官方要的某种叽叽歪歪的东西
- What's a passport, Doctor?
- Some sort of official mumbo-jumbo.

142
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,760
听着, 我们刚刚在那边发现了一具尸体
Look, we've just discovered a dead body out there.

143
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,840
你听到我说话了吗?
Did you hear me?

144
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,140
听到了, 先生. 如果我是你, 就会通知警方
Well, sir. If I were you, I'd inform the police.

145
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,880
请告诉我在哪里可以找到他们
Please tell me where we can find them.

146
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:16,880
在大厅里应该就有一个警察
There's probably a policeman in the main concourse.

147
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:19,936
- 大厅在哪儿?  - 从这个门过去往左拐
- And where is that?
- Through this door and turn to your left.

148
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,192
谢谢, 非常感谢. 走吧, Jamie
Thank you, thank you very much. Come on, Jamie.

149
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,620
我能看看你的护照吗, 先生?
May I see your passport, sir?

150
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,800
我们俩谁都没有护照!
We neither of us have passports!

151
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,580
这样你满意了吗?
Does that satisfy you?

152
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:30,496
我想你肯定搞错了, 先生
I think you must be mistaken, sir.

153
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,920
你没有护照是不可能登上飞机的
You couldn't have got on the aircraft without passports.

154
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,280
- 什么飞机?   - 你们坐着抵达这里的飞机, 先生
- What aircraft?  - The one you arrived on, sir.

155
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,080
我们不是坐着飞机抵达的
We didn't arrive on an aircraft.

156
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:40,784
好了, 听着, 这个玩笑开得有点过头了
Now, look here, this joke's gone far enough.

157
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:43,660
你也知我也知, 你们肯定是搭乘刚才进港这个航班抵达的
You know and I know that you must have arrived
on the last inbound flight

158
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:47,390
- 而这个航班729来自马德里  - 告诉他 TARDIS 的事情
- which was flight 729 from Madrid
- Tell him about the Tardis!

159
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,664
- 那是什么?   - 是我们到达这里的方法
- What's that?  - It's the way we got here.

160
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:52,416
你们两位绅士不会碰巧知道一个警察亭子吧, 知道吗?
You gentlemen wouldn't know anything
about a police box, would you?

161
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,280
我说的就是这个. 我们就是...
That's what I'm saying! We're...

162
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,880
我真的觉得我们的交通方式跟这个无关
I really think that our mode
of conveyance is irrelevant.

163
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,687
重要的事情是我们在外面发现了一具尸体!
The important thing is that
we discovered a dead body out there!

164
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:01,830
而我们想把这事报告给这里的负责人!
And we want to report it to someone in authority!

165
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:05,456
我想你们有很多机会跟负责人见面
I think you'll have plenty of opportunity
to see someone in authority.

166
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,680
- 好, 谢谢你, 非常感谢  - 你们能坐一会儿吗, 那边
- Well, thank you. Thank you very much.
- Will you take a seat, over there.

167
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,590
给我接总指挥, 谢谢
Give me the commandant, please.

168
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,088
你好, 长官. 我是Jenkins, 出入境五号柜台
Hello, sir. Jenkins here. Immigration desk five.

169
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,600
我这里有两个你说那种嫌疑人员
I've got two of your suspects here.

170
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,070
这里有人吗?
Anyone here?

171
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,630
这附近应该有人啊. 这里有人吗?
There must be someone around. Anyone here?

172
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,470
哈罗, Blade 机长在吗?
Hello. Is Captain Blade about?

173
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,400
我不知道, 我有点迷路了
I don't know. I'm a bit lost.

174
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,984
你是在找我吗?
Are you looking for me?

175
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:04,480
是的, 我这里有你的飞行排班表, 都安排好了
Yes, I have your flight schedules here.
They're all in order.

176
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,110
- 谢谢    - 再见
- Thank you.  - Goodbye.

177
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,312
- 你有什么需要吗?   - 我在找出口
- What do you want?  - I'm looking for the way out.

178
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,780
这里是私人物业, 不欢迎游客
This is private property. Visitors are not welcome.

179
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,240
你是机场方面的吗?
Do you belong to the airport staff?

180
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,008
是, 我今天刚上班
Yeah. I started today.

181
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:21,240
我不是故意来这里的, 只是走迷路了
I didn't mean to come in here. I got lost.

182
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,240
- 你确定?   - 当然确定
- Are you sure?  - Of course I am.

183
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,640
你还打算带我出去不?
Are you going to direct me or not?

184
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,360
当然, 来吧, 我给你指路
Yes, of course. Come on. I'll show you the way.

185
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:36,280
你说这个女孩儿目击了一场谋杀?
You say this girl witnessed a murder?

186
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,764
是的, 她看见那个男人被杀了
Yes, she saw the man killed.

187
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:40,950
那人被一把射线枪给电死了
He was electrocuted with a ray gun.

188
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,584
- 一把什么?   - 哦, 是什么枪又有什么关系
- A what?  - Oh, what does it matter what sort of gun.

189
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:45,648
关键是他被杀了, 而我的朋友又目睹了事情经过
The point is he was killed and my friend saw it happen.

190
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,792
那你朋友在哪儿? 我想跟她谈谈
Where is she? I'd like to talk to her.

191
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,504
这个, 又是另外一件事了, 她消失了
Well, that's another thing. She's vanished.

192
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:53,184
哦, 消失的人, 射线枪. 这是某种玩笑吗?
Oh, people who vanish, ray guns...
Is this some sort of joke?

193
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:55,696
如果你见到尸体就不会觉得这是个玩笑了
You wouldn't think it a joke if you saw the body.

194
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,448
他们是坐哪趟航班来的?
What flight did they come in on?

195
00:15:58,512 --> 00:16:02,192
长官, 他们是跟马德里729航班的乘客一起进来的
Well, sir, they came in with the passengers
from flight 729 from Madrid,

196
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,792
但他们没有护照
but they've no passports.

197
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,928
也许你们可以解释一下, 你们为什么没有护照
Perhaps you'd kindly explain why you have no passports.

198
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,168
哦, 天, 我们完全是在浪费时间!
Oh, look, we're all wasting time!

199
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,057
你们还去不去看尸体了?
Are you going to come and see that body, or am I

200
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:16,290
或者是我得去找这个地方真正的负责人?
going to find someone
who really is in charge in this place?

201
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,612
我就是这里的负责人, 谢谢
I am in charge of this place, thank you.

202
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:21,370
现在, 你们俩立刻陪我去这个机库
Now, you both accompany me to this hangar immediately.

203
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,050
谢谢, 非常感谢你. 终于!
Thank you! Thank you very much. At last!

204
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,920
- 把我的去向告诉航空控制台  - 是, 先生
- Tell Air Traffic Control where I am.  - Yes, sir.

205
00:16:32,256 --> 00:16:34,032
这里是出入境五号柜台
Immigration desk five here.

206
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,160
一号已经刚往机库去了, 他期望我告诉你们这个信息
Number One's just gone to the hangar area.
He wanted me to let you know.

207
00:16:38,672 --> 00:16:41,168
事实上, 他是去找一具死尸
As a matter of fact,
he's just gone to look for a dead body.

208
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,400
是啊, 总会有这么一天的, 对吧?
Yes, It's gonna be one of those days, isn't it?

209
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,728
- 搞定她了?   - 她已经被处理了
- Get her?  - She's being processed.

210
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,904
下一航班他们可以再带一个了
They can take another on the next flight.

211
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,856
很好
Excellent.

212
00:17:33,664 --> 00:17:35,520
尸体 - 不见了!
The body - it's gone!

213
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,112
- 你能肯定就是这个机库?   - 是, 名字都在外面呢
- You're quite sure you've got the right hangar?
- Aye. The name's up outside.

214
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,250
尸体刚才就躺在这里
The body was lying just here.

215
00:17:44,336 --> 00:17:47,152
那, 那我们看看能找到什么, 行吗?
Well, let's see what we HAVE got, shall we?

216
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,717
你到底是在做什么?
What exactly are you doing?

217
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,660
当然是在帮警察找线索啊
For the police, of course.

218
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,740
问题在于我没法告诉他们那人是谁
The trouble is I can't tell them who he was.

219
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:00,576
某种神秘人物, 肯定无疑
Some sort of mystery man, no doubt.

220
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,970
是的, 事实上他真是
Yes, as a matter of fact he was.

221
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,570
他口袋里没有任何东西可以表明他的身份
There was nothing in his pockets to identify him.

222
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,410
哦, 一个口袋里没有任何东西的人
Oh, a man with nothing in his pockets

223
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,410
是的, 我也觉得很诧异
Yes, I was rather surprised myself.

224
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,410
等等, 还真有个东西
Wait. There WAS one thing.

225
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,400
- 他口袋里有什么?   - 这个
- What did he have in his pocket?  - This.

226
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:18,400
- 一张邮票?   - 但它是西班牙的, 而且还没有用过
- A postage stamp.
- But it's Spanish and it hasn't been used.

227
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,080
噢, 我肯定这就有很大的不同了
Oh, I'm sure that'll make all the difference.

228
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,930
的确. 哈罗...这有点意思
Exactly. Hello... This is interesting.

229
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,570
你现在发现了什么?
What have you found now?

230
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,330
一丝被烧焦的纤维
It's burnt fibres.

231
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:30,144
这说明什么, 博士?
What about this, Doctor?

232
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,544
刚才这里并没有, 这里有个烧焦的痕迹
This wasn't here before. It's a burn mark.

233
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,992
你说的对, Jamie, 这是新的
You're right, Jamie. It's quite new.

234
00:18:35,952 --> 00:18:38,520
能见到有人肯动动脑, 真是高兴
It's good to see someone is using their intelligence.

235
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,488
噢, 我受够这些了! 你们俩跟我来
Oh, I've had enough of this!
You two coming with me.

236
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,120
绝对是射线枪造成的
Definitely made by a ray gun.

237
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,176
射线枪, 烧焦的纤维, 外国邮票
Ray gun, burnt fibres, foreign stamps...

238
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,672
- 没用过的外国邮票 - 好, 没用过的外国邮票
- Unused foreign stamps.
- All right, unused foreign stamps.

239
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,344
我肯定是跟你一样疯了, 还在听你瞎说!
I must be as mad as you are,
even to be listening to you!

240
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,488
- 你知道他们把它怎么样了么?   - 把什么怎么样了?
- You know what they've done with it?
- Done with what?

241
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:56,896
尸体. 在某个地方肯定有一个很大的行李箱
The body. Somewhere there's a large packing case.

242
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,252
就在你后面, 博士
Right behind you, Doctor.

243
00:19:04,032 --> 00:19:07,296
- 需要我帮忙吗?  - 你是变色龙观光团的吗
- Can I help you?
- Are you connected with Chameleon Tours?

244
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:09,600
是的, 我是机长Blade, 首席飞行员
Yes. I'm Captain Blade - chief pilot.

245
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:12,290
这两位绅士觉得...
These gentlemen think...

246
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,100
- ...这里发生了一场事故. - 事故?
- ...there's an incident happened in here.  - An incident?

247
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,648
你介意我们看一下这个行李箱里面吗?
Would you mind if we have a look in this packing case?

248
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:20,448
- 冒昧问一下, 你是哪位?  - 我是机场总指挥
- May I ask who you are?  - I'm the commandant.

249
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:22,864
可以, 当然可以
Yes, of course.

250
00:19:24,576 --> 00:19:26,920
你们指望找到什么呢?
What do you expect to find?

251
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,800
一个死人
A dead man.

252
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,290
真有意思
How very interesting.

253
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,960
塑料杯!
Plastic cups!

254
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,360
现在我得做点自己的调查工作了
Now I'm going to do some investigating of my own.

255
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,960
我很高兴终于激起了你的兴趣!
I'm glad I've roused your interest!

256
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,984
哦, 的确是, 不过我打算调查的是你
Oh, you have. But what I'm going to investigate is you.

257
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:51,952
还有你俩为什么会出现在机场
and why you're both here in the airport.

258
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:54,032
谢谢你, Blade 机长. 来吧, 你俩, 出去
Thank you, Captain Blade. Come on, you two. Out.

259
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,032
我们最好迁就一下他
We'd better humour him.

260
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,440
把他弄下来
Bring him down.

261
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,480
好了
It's all right.

262
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,856
- 他能活下来吗?  - 如果我们动作快点
- Will he survive? - If we hurry.

263
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,224
就这里了
There you are.

264
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:31,472
我们得把你弄到机场大楼去
We've got to get you to the airport building.

265
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:33,472
然后你就安全了
And you'll be safe.

266
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,384
你快要到窒息点了, 快点
He's reaching suffocation point. Hurry.

267
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,192
你都没有让我好好搜查
You didn't let me search properly.

268
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,992
那个机库出租给了一个私有承包公司
That hangar is leased to a private charter company.

269
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,080
我都无权在那里进行搜查, 更别说你了
I've have no right to search in there, let alone you.

270
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,280
现在, 你可否坐下来, 保持安静?
Now, will you kindly sit down and keep quiet?

271
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,752
Jenkins, 给我接 Reynolds 警司
Jenkins, get onto Superintendent Reynolds.

272
00:20:51,088 --> 00:20:53,480
这是他的活儿, 这些人在这里乱闯
This is his job. These people are trespassing.

273
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,368
- 我这里刚有另外一家飞机抵港  - 好吧, 我自己来
- I've just got another flight coming through.
- All right. I'll do it.

274
00:20:57,376 --> 00:20:58,720
博士, 你看!
Doctor, look!

275
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,120
总指挥, 这就是我刚跟你说的那个女孩
Commandant, this is the girl I was telling you about.

276
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,348
I beg your pardon?
你说什么?
