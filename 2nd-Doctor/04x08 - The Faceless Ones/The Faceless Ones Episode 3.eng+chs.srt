1
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:35,377
有谁能帮帮我, 求求你们
<i>Somebody help me, please.</i>

2
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,230
我要窒息了
<i>I'm suffocating!</i>

3
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,910
快点, 有谁能帮帮我...
<i>Quickly! Somebody help me, please!</i>

4
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,670
我要窒息了
<i>I'm suffocating!</i>

5
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:47,000
帮帮我, 求求你们!
<i>Help me! Please!</i>

6
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:15,488
那, 但我的弟弟怎么办?
Yeah, but what about me brother?

7
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,066
恐怕我现在有更严重的情况要查, 小姐
I'm afraid I've got something
more serious to look into first, Miss.

8
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:19,550
如果这个年轻人说的是实情
If this young man's telling the truth,

9
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:20,750
我的一个同事已经被谋害了
a colleague of mine's been murdered.

10
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:24,377
- 博士, 这个人有话和你说  - 哦, 是谁?
- Doctor, this man wants to talk to you. - Oh, Who is he?

11
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,666
就是这位, 先生
There you are, sir.

12
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:29,222
Crossland 督察, 苏格兰场
"Detective Inspector Crossland. Scotland Yard. "

13
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:32,600
- 我把一切都告诉他了  - 你见过这个人吗?
- I told him everything.
- Have you ever seen that man?

14
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,977
就是我们在变色龙机库发现的那个人!
Well, that's the man we found in the Chameleon Tours hangar.

15
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,933
博士的尸体呢, 在哪儿
The Doctor's body. Where is it?

16
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,311
他...逃走了
He... escaped.

17
00:03:54,777 --> 00:04:01,022
他的智力远在那些普通人之上
His intelligence is far above normal beings.

18
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:03,577
也在你之上, 估计
Above YOURS, perhaps

19
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:07,422
我得走了, 去苏黎世的飞机已经准备起飞了
I must leave. The flight to Zurich is ready to take off.

20
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:09,200
你就留在这里
You will remain here.

21
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:13,711
- 为什么目的?  - 弥补你的无能
- For what purpose? - To atone for your incompetence.

22
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:17,933
博士必须死, 你必须搞定
The Doctor must die, and you must do it.

23
00:04:23,155 --> 00:04:25,000
好了, 博士, 我们去见总指挥
All right then, Doctor, we'll go and see the commandant.

24
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:26,155
我想让他听听你的故事
I want him to hear your story.

25
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,355
但是, 上一次他并没有太相信
Well, he wasn't very impressed with it the last time.

26
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,111
这一次, 他会相信你
This time, he's gonna believe you.

27
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,200
好吧, 如果你觉得
Well, if you think so.

28
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,790
Jamie, 待在这里盯着柜台, 我们不会很久
Jamie, stay here and keep an eye on the kiosk.
We shan't be long.

29
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,350
别担心你的弟弟, 小姐. 我们会替你找到他
Don't worry about your brother, Miss.
We'll find him for you.

30
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:44,670
- 这个督察以后会很出色的!   - 但他相信我们
- A fat lot of good that inspector's going to be!
- But he believes us.

31
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:47,800
哦, 是, 不过那也不代表他肯定会采取什么措施
Oh, year, but that doesn't mean to say
he's going to do anything.

32
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,990
我想我得去那个变色龙机库看一遭
I think I'll go and have a look
round that Chameleon hangar.

33
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:53,470
你自己可不行
Not by yourself.

34
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:56,470
是啊, 我觉得要是有位男士陪我去, 肯定会好些
Well, I suppose it would be better
if I had a man with me.

35
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,190
是, 如果博士没让我盯着这个地方就好了
Aye. If only the Doctor hadn't told me
to watch this place.

36
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,470
哦, 你是不是总是按别人的吩咐做事?
Oh, do you always do everything you're told?

37
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,070
不是, 但是博士信任我
No, but the Doctor trusts me.

38
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,908
哦, 这就是你的问题了, 对不?
Yeah, that's your trouble, isn't it!

39
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,480
好吧, 待在这里
All right, stay here.

40
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:10,760
毕竟, 他们最多也只能杀了我, 拜拜
After all, they can only murder me. Ta-ra.

41
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,960
不, 等等
No, wait a minute.

42
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,466
我估计这里也不会有什么情况, 你觉得呢?
I don't suppose anything will happen here, do you?

43
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,680
他们都已经关掉柜台了, 所以不太可能
Since they closed the kiosk, so it's hardly likely.

44
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,440
而且我们不会耽误很久, 对吧?
And we won't be long, will we?

45
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,350
这就取决于我们能发现什么. 快走吧, 小子
Well, that depends on what we find. Come on, kid.

46
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:25,355
不管怎么, 你需要我给你带路
In any case, you need me
to show you the way there!

47
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,720
好了好了, 我接受你发现了一具尸体
All right, all right.
I'll accept that you found a body,

48
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,177
但我还是想知道你从哪里来的, 为什么没有护照
but I still want to know where you come from
and why you have no passport.

49
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:43,310
- 显然这不重要吧?   - 违反法律不可能不重要!
- Surely that's unimportant?
- It is not unimportant to break the law!

50
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,190
先生, 我觉得我们还是得让他先说说
Sir, I think we'll have to let him
tell us in his own way.

51
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,910
- 好吧, 简短一点  - 谢谢你
- Very well. Make it brief.  Thank you.

52
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,120
我刚刚去变色龙观光游的机库进行了一番搜索
I have just carried out a search
of the Chameleon Tours hangar.

53
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,488
在一个行李箱里面, 我们找到了一个男人的躯体
In a packing case, I found the body of a man.

54
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:00,355
你没告诉我这个, 博士. 又一个人死了?
You never told me that, Doctor.
Another dead man?

55
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:04,820
没死, 他处于一种神志不清的状态, 一种昏迷
No, he was in a stupefied state, a sort of coma.

56
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,711
- 这个人是谁?   - 我不知道他的名字
- Who's this one?
- I don't know his name.

57
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:09,733
但我有种感觉, 他是你的雇员之一
But I have a feeling he's one of your employees.

58
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,370
- 噢, 真的?  - 事实上, 我觉得他可能就在这里
- Oh, indeed?
- In fact, I think he may be in here.

59
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,920
滑行, 沿南部滑行路, 前往27号起飞跑道
Taxi, following southern taxi way
for departure runway 27...

60
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:37,288
- 你知道这是什么吗?  - 我觉得它像支钢笔
- Do you know what this is?
- It looks like a fountain pen to me.

61
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,377
事情并不总是看起来的那样. 小心, 它很危险!
Things are not always what they seem.
Careful! It's dangerous.

62
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,980
变色龙观光游也不像它看起来那样
Chameleon Tours are not quite what they seem either.

63
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,440
And what's your theory?
那你的理论是什么?

64
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:48,533
等你听了, 恐怕你不会相信
I'm afraid you won't believe it
when you hear it....

65
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:55,066
首先, Gascoigne 督察被一把射线枪谋杀了
First, Inspector Gascoigne
was murdered with a ray gun.

66
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,260
一把射线枪?
A ray gun?

67
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,880
一种在这个地球上还没被研发出来的武器
A weapon that has not yet
been developed on this Earth.

68
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:02,088
- 哦, 真的吗?   - 你看, 我就知道你不会相信我
- Oh, really!
- You see, I knew you wouldn't believe it.

69
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:05,066
不, 请耐心点, 先生. 我们在试着理解你说的
No, now be patient, sir.
We are trying to understand you.

70
00:07:05,244 --> 00:07:09,288
很好. 然后, 我相信变色龙观光游
Very well. Next, I believe Chameleon Tours

71
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,844
- 只不过是一个幌子, 一个掩护 - 掩护什么?
- to be merely a front - a cover.
- For what?

72
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,488
掩护他们大规模绑架年轻人
For the mass kidnapping of young people.

73
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:20,577
而所有这些都发生在我的机场?
And is all this supposed
to be taking place in my airport?

74
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,533
- 是的, 就在当下!   - 这可真够了!
- Yes. At this very moment.
- That's quite enough!

75
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,755
你就不能把这家伙关起来吗?
Can't you take that fellow into custody?

76
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,577
很抱歉, 先生. 但你知道他没有违反任何法律
Well, I'm very sorry, sir,
but you know he hasn't broken any law.

77
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,950
除非是出入境方面的问题, 那可不是我的职责范围
except for this immigration business,
and that's not my responsibility.

78
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:32,488
- Brian Briggs 是你的职责范围  - 那又是谁?
- Brian Briggs IS your responsibility!
- Who is he?

79
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,888
他是个年轻人, 参加了变色龙观光游, 然后消失了!
He's a young man who went on
the Chameleon tour and vanished.

80
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,840
得了, 博士, 等一下. 这一点我们还没有确认
Come on Doctor, wait a minute.
We're not certain of that yet.

81
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:40,460
四处都找不到他, 也找不到我的两朋友
Well, he's nowhere to be found,
and neither are my two friends,

82
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,911
这在我看来就证实了我的观点——
which in mind proves my point:

83
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,311
变色龙观光游是个幌子, 就为了绑架年轻人
Chameleon Tours are a cover
for the abducting of young people.

84
00:07:47,355 --> 00:07:49,650
敢问他们被带到哪里去了?
And just where do you think they're taking them?

85
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:52,888
你看, 从我已经呈现的事实来看
Well, in view of the facts that I've already presented

86
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:56,444
射线枪, 这种笔, 以及其它一两个东西
the ray gun, this pen,
and one or two other things -

87
00:07:57,288 --> 00:07:59,933
我想我们在对付的人, 不是来自这个星球!
I think we're dealing with people
who are not from this planet.

88
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,577
这也没能回答我的问——你刚才说什么?
That hardly answers my que...
What did you say?!

89
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,860
你看, 我就知道你不信我
You see, I knew you wouldn't believe me.

90
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,600
这完完全全是胡说八道!
This is absolute arrant nonsense!

91
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:12,244
你看, 博士, 我觉得应该提供一些证据来支撑这些说法
Look, Doctor, I think you ought to
produce some evidence to support all this.

92
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,866
- 证据? 这支笔怎么说?   - 一只笔! 你管这叫证据?
- Evidence? What about this pen?
- A pen! Do you call that evidence?

93
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:18,422
我来给你演示一下
I'll demonstrate it for you.

94
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:24,355
打扰了
Excuse me.

95
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:29,288
- 你介意帮我们一下吗?   - 我没明白
- Would you mind helping us?
- I don't understand.

96
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:31,777
你能不能把这个杯子举在面前?
Could you hold this cup out in front of you?

97
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:33,888
很好
Very well.

98
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:40,260
- 也许你以前见过这个?   - 没有. 啊!
- Perhaps you've seen one of these before?
- No. Agh!

99
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:47,600
它变成冰了!
It's turned to ice!

100
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:52,933
你管这个叫胡说八道?
Do you call that arrant nonsense?

101
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,844
亲爱的妈妈爸爸, 已经安全抵达黑森林了
"Dear Mum and Dad.
Have arrived safely in the Black Forest."

102
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,240
我会很快再写给你们, 爱你们的 Tim
"Will write again soon. Love, Tim. "

103
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:17,800
亲爱的爸爸, 我...
"Dear Dad, I... "

104
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,466
亲爱的妈妈...
"Dear Mum... "

105
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:22,440
Jamie!
Jamie!

106
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:28,080
Jamie! 你看我找到了什么
Jamie! Look what I've found.

107
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,933
这里至少有50张明信片
There must be 50 postcards here.

108
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,066
这肯定能让那位督察采取点什么行动了
That should make that inspector do something.

109
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:34,822
你说得对, 而且我知道去哪里找他
You're right, and I know where to find him.

110
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:40,555
你是个勇敢的小姑娘, 现在没时间向你致敬了
You're a brave wee lassie.
No time to greet now.

111
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,630
闪开! 有什么东西进我眼睛了. 走吧
Get off! I've got something in me eye. Come on.

112
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,270
我们往哪儿走?
Where are we going?

113
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,555
总指挥的办公室
The commandant's office.

114
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,470
博士, 这是你要的变色龙观光游后面的飞机排班表
Doctor, here are the remaining flight schedules
for Chameleon Tours you wanted.

115
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,577
- 这个小装置可真厉害  - 最好让我仔细检查一下, 先生
- What a nasty little device.
- I'd better get that checked over, sir.

116
00:10:00,644 --> 00:10:02,866
- 什么情况?   - Samantha, 下来这边
- What the devil...   - Samantha, down here.

117
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,200
- 明信片, 快看!  - 我不会容忍有人乱闯控制室!
- Postcards! Look.
- I will not have my control room invaded!

118
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:09,977
- 有这些也不行吗?  - 你拿的是什么?
- Not even for these?
- What have you got there?

119
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,200
我想这是你要求的进一步证据, 督察
I think it's the further evidence
you required, Inspector.

120
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:17,911
对了...跟我想的一样
Yes... Just as I thought.

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,244
- 你在哪里拿到的?  - 在那个机库的办公室里
- Where did you get these?
- In the office in that hangar.

122
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,244
- 你明白这意味着什么吗?   - 规律已经很明显了
- You see what they mean?
- All falling into a pattern.

123
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,333
这个信封写的寄信地址是德国的某个地方
This envelope is addressed to somewhere in Germany.

124
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:31,060
还有, 德文的版本
Yeah. "Dem Chameleon Reisen, Freiberg."
That means Chameleon Tours.

125
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:33,590
你都在叨叨些什么?
Just what are you all talking about?

126
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,400
你瞧, 他们派发出这些卡片
You see, they give out these cards,

127
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:39,630
让这些孩子在出发之前就写给他们家里的父母
and get the kids to write home
to their parents before they go.

128
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,540
变色龙观光游的家伙就把这些卡片带上飞机
The Chameleon Tours lot take the cards abroad

129
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,590
然后他们把卡片寄回不列颠
and THEY post them back to Britain.

130
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:47,777
于是父母们就以为他们的孩子已经安全抵达了
So the parents think the children
have arrived safely.

131
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,480
博士, 你觉得他们身上发生了什么事情?
Doctor, what do you think happens to them?

132
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,600
不, 不, 这些都只不过是臆测
Now, now. This is all mere supposition!

133
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,300
噢, 对你来说, 也许吧
Oh, to you, maybe,

134
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,420
但这里面其中一个孩子恰巧就是我弟弟
but one of those kids
happens to be my brother.

135
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,622
你弟弟?
Your brother?

136
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,560
是, 先生, 就是这位小姐的弟弟失踪了
Aye, sir. This is the young lady
whose brother's missing

137
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,710
而且你看, 她的确收到了一张她弟弟从罗马寄来的卡片
and you see, she did get a card from him in Rome.

138
00:11:04,888 --> 00:11:09,088
可是为什么有谁会绑架这些年轻人呢?
But why would anyone want
to abduct these young people?

139
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:12,044
要是我们知道了这个, 我们就不会干坐在这里了
Well, if we knew that, we wouldn't be sitting here.

140
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:15,400
督察, 我能跟你说句话吗?
Inspector, can I have a word with you?

141
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,533
你不觉得这家伙有点不正常吗, 对不?
You don't think this fellow's
a little unbalanced, do you?

142
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:24,622
哦, 也许是有点不循规蹈矩, 先生
Oh maybe a wee bit unorthodox, sir.

143
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:27,177
但毕竟, 到目前为止是他给了我们唯一的线索
But after all, he's given us
the only lead we've got so far.

144
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,200
如果你愿意, 不如放手让他干
If you could, just see your way to giving him a free hand.

145
00:11:29,244 --> 00:11:32,311
- 让他干?  - 只是四处摸索一下, 先生
- A free hand? - Just to poke around a little bit, sir.

146
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,644
你觉得安全吗, 让这个家伙在机场乱窜?
Do you think it's safe to
let the fellow roam around the airport?

147
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:39,755
你可以依靠我们来盯着他, 先生
You can rely on us to keep an eye on him, sir.

148
00:11:40,622 --> 00:11:42,911
好吧, 但记在你的头上
All right, but on your head be it.

149
00:11:43,422 --> 00:11:46,197
我自己会去调查变色龙观光游
I personally will investigate Chameleon Tours

150
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:49,044
如果发现什么, 也会回报给你
then I'll report back to you
if I've found out anything.

151
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,960
但于此同时, 你尽量让一切照常运转, 你明白吗?
But in the meantime, if you could just keep
everything going as normal, you understand?

152
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,480
- 我们不想让他们听到任何风吹草动  - 不, 不会
- We don't want them to get wind of anything.
- No, no, no, no, no.

153
00:11:57,688 --> 00:12:04,511
博士, 我给你在机场12个小时的自由时间, 愿老天帮我
Doctor, I'm giving you the freedom
of the airport for 12 hours, heaven help me.

154
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:09,440
等12个小时结束, 我期望你带着点真正的证据回到这里来
At the end of that time, I shall expect you
back here with some real facts this time.

155
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,800
谢谢你, 总指挥
Thank you, Commandant.

156
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:16,377
- 他们信了那个博士了吗?   - 我不知道
- Did they believe the Doctor?
- I don't know.

157
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,822
- 什么意思?   - 我想他怀疑上我了
- What do you mean?
- I think he suspects me.

158
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:22,533
他朝我打开了我们的一个武器, 迫使我跑开了
He turned one of our own weapons on me.
Forced me to leave.

159
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:26,177
你个笨蛋, 你应该待着不动的
You fool. You should have stayed.

160
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:29,800
现在, 我们没法知道他到底发现了多少了
Now, we do not know
how much he has discovered.

161
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:34,622
即使他发现了我们的秘密任务, 他们也不会相信他的
Even if he has discovered the secret
of our mission, they won't believe him.

162
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,555
这些地球人的脑子想不了那么远
These Earth minds cannot stretch that far.

163
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:42,555
当然, 事实远非他们的智力所能想到, 除了博士
Of course, the truth is beyond their
intelligence, except for that Doctor.

164
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,755
我知道他在那里, 我可以杀了他
I know where he is. I could kill him.

165
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,222
你是要去, 不过不能让你自己有危险
You're going to, but not at the risk
of your own safety.

166
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:52,155
我们还需要你待在航空控制塔台
We still need you in Air Traffic Control.

167
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:56,733
带上这个, 贴到他身上
Take this. Attach it to him.

168
00:12:57,466 --> 00:13:00,600
等你搞好了, 我就可以用这个激活这个装置
When you're ready, I shall
activate the mechanism with this.

169
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:04,844
- 这就可以一劳永逸解决他  - 很好
- That should put paid to him once and for all.
- Very well.

170
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,222
别耽误
Don't delay.

171
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:10,755
我要他在 Blade 队长回来之前就死了
I want him dead before Captain Blade returns.

172
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:18,422
博士...
Doctor...

173
00:13:18,555 --> 00:13:22,044
- 我给你和你两个朋友做了通行证  - 谢谢你
- I've made out a pass for you and your two friends.
- Thank you.

174
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,070
抱歉, 先生. 有一架变色龙的航班进来了
Excuse me, sir. There's a Chameleon
flight coming in now.

175
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:31,177
ADSXL 呼叫盖特威克机场塔台
<i>Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima
calling Gatwick Airport Control.</i>

176
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,630
盖特威克塔台呼叫ADSXL航班
Gatwick Control to
Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima.

177
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,666
盖特威克塔台呼叫ADSXL航班
Gatwick Control to
Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima.

178
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,377
我现在告诉你航向
I will now give you your heading.

179
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,511
- 他们一天有多少航班?   - 七到八个
- How many flights do they use a day?
- Seven or eight.

180
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:53,466
- 他们有几架飞机?  - 四架
- How many planes do they use?
- Four.

181
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,840
我可以查到他们的注册号, 如果你需要的话
I could get their registration numbers if you like.

182
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,330
为什么问这个?
Why do you ask?

183
00:13:57,511 --> 00:13:59,955
一天八个航班却只有四架飞机, 这正常吗?
Eight flights a day and only four planes.
Is that normal?

184
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:01,830
正常, 只要他们周转得快
Yes. They have a very quick turnaround.

185
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,955
我是说, 毕竟他们只有短途航线
I mean, after all they're only on short haul flights

186
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,480
你知道的, 都是些旅游胜地, /
You know, all the holiday centres.

187
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,240
西班牙, 罗马, 雅典, 黑森林
Spain, Rome, Athens, the Black Forest.

188
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,400
- Jean, 冬天的排班表在哪里  - 抱歉
- Jean, where's the file on winter schedules.
- Excuse me.

189
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,466
- 哪个是变色龙的飞机  - 哦, 就那个, 先生
- Which is the Chameleon plane?
- Oh that one, sir.

190
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,088
你看, 他正在 Dunsfold 左转弯
Look, he's turning left at Dunsfold.

191
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,000
我会告诉他在Epsom等待, 直到我给出降落许可
I shall hold him now over Epsom
until I can give him landing clearance.

192
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:21,711
- 你们雷达的有效范围是多少?   - 130英里, 怎么了?
- What's the range of your radar?
- 130 miles. Why?

193
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,200
- 我在想他们的飞机什么时候出现  - 我不清楚, 先生
- I wondered when this plane first appeared.
- I've no idea, sir.

194
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:28,640
在他们开始呼叫之前我们看不到他们. 我先离开一下
We don't notice them until they start to call in.
Now excuse me a moment.

195
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,666
盖特威克塔台呼叫ADSXL航班
<i>Gatwick Control
to Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima.</i>

196
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:36,888
爬升到一万英尺, 在 Epsom 管制区等待降落许可
<i>Climb to 10,000 feet and hold in
Epsom control zone to await landing clearance.</i>

197
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:42,311
ADSXL航班, 爬升到一万英尺, 就地等待
<i>Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima.
Climbing to 10,000 feet and holding.</i>

198
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,666
起飞之后你们可以跟住他们多久?
How long do you hold them after take-off?

199
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:49,111
一旦他们离开盖特威克管制区, 我们跟他们就没关系了
Once they've left Gatwick Control Zone,
we've finished with them.

200
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,600
我明白了, 那就意味着他们可能去任何地方
I see. That means they might be anywhere.

201
00:14:53,777 --> 00:14:58,600
你不是宁愿浪费你的12个小时四处乱窜吗, 还来打扰我的人?
Aren't you rather wasting your 12 hours
hanging around here, disturbing my people?

202
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,511
我觉得我一分钟都没有浪费
I don't think I've been wasting a minute,

203
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:03,800
但你非要我走的话, 我会走. Sam! Jamie!
but I'll go if you insist. Sam! Jamie!

204
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:06,750
- 抱歉  - 没事, 完全是我的错
- Sorry.  - It's all right. It's quite my fault.

205
00:15:07,422 --> 00:15:10,600
- 我以前在什么地方没碰见过你吗?   - 我觉得没有
- Haven't I met you somewhere before?
- I don't think so.

206
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,622
你肯定有一个替身!
You must have a double!

207
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:30,777
打扰一下, 你是这里的经理吗?
Excuse me, are you the manager?

208
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:32,777
我负责订票, 有什么可以帮你的?
I'm looking after bookings. Can I help?

209
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,333
我要跟经理谈话
I'd rather like to speak to the manager...

210
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,450
- 我是位警官  - 我们有麻烦吗?
- I'm a police officer.  - Is there some trouble?

211
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,755
- 我想和负责人谈  - 那得找 Blade 机长
- I'd prefer to speak to the person in charge.
- That's Captain Blade.

212
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,240
他刚从一个航班返回了, 下一个航班马上又要出发
He's just returned from one flight,
taking off for another.

213
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,680
- 他这会儿真的很忙  - 也许我可以直接去飞机上?
- He's rather busy at the moment.
- Perhaps I could go out to the plane?

214
00:15:49,711 --> 00:15:52,377
我得去看看. 请等一下
I'll have to see about that. Just a moment, please.

215
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:03,733
有个警探要见你
A detective wants to see you.

216
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:05,977
他怀疑什么了吗?
<i>Does he suspect anything?</i>

217
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:07,622
我不知道
I don't know.

218
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:12,888
好, 送他去飞机上吧, 我们来对付他
<i>All right. Send him over to the plane.
We'll deal with him.</i>

219
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:16,666
你确定就是这个房间, 博士?
Are you sure this is the right room, Doctor?

220
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:19,688
- Jamie, 你什么时候见我出过错?   - 真是!
- Jamie, have you ever known me to be mistaken?  - Aye!

221
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:22,444
- 嘿, 小心一点  - 什么?
- Hey. Now watch out.  - What?

222
00:16:22,577 --> 00:16:25,200
毒气喷嘴就是从那面墙出来的
That's the wall the gas nozzles came out of.

223
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:27,200
但现在这里什么也没有了
There's nothing here now.

224
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:30,555
你说得对
You're right.

225
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:33,133
这很高明, 非常高明
That's clever, very clever.

226
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:35,644
哦, 好了, 这就变得简单了
Oh, well, it makes life simpler for us.

227
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:39,111
看, 我定住的那个人是从这附近出来的
Now, the man I froze came from here somewhere.

228
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,520
是, 有可能 - 一堵实墙啊
Aye, he would - a solid wall

229
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,770
这堵实墙的某个地方, 有一道门
Somewhere in that solid wall, there's a door.

230
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,777
应该是. 我们还是没有找到 Ben 和 Polly
Aye, and we still haven't found Ben and Polly.

231
00:16:45,911 --> 00:16:48,180
- 你觉得他们发生什么事了?   - 我不知道
- What do you think's happened to them?
- I don't know.

232
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,116
也许我们找到了门, 就能找到他们
Perhaps if we find that door, we'll find them.

233
00:16:51,116 --> 00:16:53,290
快来, 你找那边, 我找这边
Come on. You take that end, I'll take this.

234
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,380
我们得快点
We must hurry.

235
00:16:56,444 --> 00:16:59,222
Crossland 督察这会儿在牵制他们
Inspector Crossland's keeping them busy at the moment,

236
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:03,490
如果他用力过猛的话, 他不是他们的对手
but he'll be no match for them
if he presses them too far.

237
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,755
你会发现整架飞机都严格遵守国际航空安全标准
You'll find that the whole plane conforms strictly
to the international standards of air safety.

238
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,511
我想不会有任何人会投诉我们
I can't think why anybody would complain about us.

239
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:20,860
我说过有人投诉吗? 我不是来查安全措施的
Did I say anyone had complained?
I'm not enquiring about safety.

240
00:17:21,444 --> 00:17:25,222
我来查的是一个失踪的男孩, 是你们航班的乘客
My enquiries are about a missing boy.
A passenger on one of your flights.

241
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,377
同时还有我的一个同事, Gascoigne 督察
And there's also the business of a colleague
of mine, Detective Inspector Gascoigne,

242
00:17:28,488 --> 00:17:29,955
最后有人看见他也是在你们机库
was last seen in your hangar.

243
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:31,955
有人相信他已经被害了
He's believed to have been murdered.

244
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,244
这确实不是一件小事
That is indeed a serious matter.

245
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,880
恐怕我得让你推迟起飞一会儿
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you
to hold up this flight a while,

246
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,040
我有一些问题要问你
while I ask you some questions.

247
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,760
你介意来总指挥的办公室吗?
Would you mind coming to the commandant's office?

248
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,180
你得允许我失陪一下, 督察
If you'll just excuse me for a moment, Inspector,

249
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,000
我有些事情要安排
I have some arrangements to make.

250
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,111
- 抱歉, 请  - 对不起
- Excuse me, please.  - I'm sorry.

251
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,088
Blade 机长!
Captain Blade!

252
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:18,444
如果我是你, 就不会再移动一步
I shouldn't move any further if I were you.

253
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:24,666
这把枪在对付你的同事时非常有效, 那位 Gascoigne 督察
This gun proved remarkably effective
in dealing with your colleague, Inspector Gascoigne.

254
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:27,711
- 你杀了他  - 很不幸, 一个失误
- You killed him.  - Unfortunately, an error.

255
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:31,333
你们地球人活着对我们更有用
You Earth men are more use to us alive.

256
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:34,555
坐到那里去
Sit down there.

257
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,644
好多了
That's better.

258
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:54,044
这个地球人是个非常不错的标本, 你觉得呢?
This Earth man is a particularly
fine specimen, don't you think?

259
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:57,311
- 也许适合总管他自己  - 的确
- Perhaps the director himself.  - Exactly.

260
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,500
不管你俩计划把我怎么样
Whatever you two are planning for me,

261
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,800
我必须警告你, 这都在英国法律的长臂管辖内
