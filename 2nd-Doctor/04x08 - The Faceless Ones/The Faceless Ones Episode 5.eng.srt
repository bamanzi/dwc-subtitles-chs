1
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:04,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:29,072
Negative report from Air Sea Rescue, sir.

3
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:33,130
But with two aircraft ditching, there must be some signs of wreckage.

4
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:36,266
Why do you think the Chameleon plane crashed into the sea?

5
00:00:36,568 --> 00:00:38,933
Because it disappeared off our radar screen!

6
00:00:39,226 --> 00:00:40,612
But it stood still first!

7
00:00:40,764 --> 00:00:44,091
Because it must have collided with the RAF plane and dropped like a stone.

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,458
Why do you think that?

9
00:00:45,876 --> 00:00:53,364
You see, when a plane on that radar appears to stand still, it is in point of fact dropping straight down.

10
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:54,944
What about straight up?

11
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:06,514
Oh my dear Doctor! To get above our radar umbrella like that it would have to climb vertically until it was a hundred miles high. The darned thing would be in outer space.

12
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:08,008
Exactly!

13
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:56,963
That plane they sent to follow us. Should we have destroyed it?

14
00:01:58,103 --> 00:02:15,528
We could eliminate a whole squadron of their toy planes and they'd never get on to us. Their minds can't cope with an operation like this. Remember the teaching of our Director - the intelligence of Earth people is comparable only to that of animals on our planet.

15
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:22,082
I thought I'd missed one of you. I wondered what happened to you.

16
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,622
What have you done to them?!

17
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:25,104
Close that drawer.

18
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,540
No... No... Don't leave me.

19
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,135
Right, thank you.

20
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:50,214
Air Sea Rescue say they're still searching but there's no trace yet.

21
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:53,569
Commandant.

22
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:58,673
I see - did the pilot managed to bail out?

23
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:01,642
I'm sorry.

24
00:05:03,045 --> 00:05:08,057
They've found the remains of that RAF plane. The pilot had been electrocuted.

25
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:10,890
Do you still think these people are from Earth?

26
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:19,239
I don't know, Doctor. I just don't know what to think. If only there was one solid piece of evidence.

27
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,372
I think it's just come in!

28
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:26,669
Do you mind if I question him? I think I know how to make him talk.

29
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:37,950
You know what this is, don't you?

30
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:39,889
I don't know what you're talking about.

31
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,411
Oh I think you do. Roll up your sleeve.

32
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,489
Do I have to take orders from him, sir?

33
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:48,321
I think perhaps you should explain, Doctor. After all, this man is working for me.

34
00:05:48,485 --> 00:06:00,869
You only think he's working for you! Commandant, your personnel are being systematically replaced. And this is how they're doing it. This is not Meadows, it only looks like Meadows. He's wearing one of these things on his arm.

35
00:06:02,273 --> 00:06:03,483
Very well, do as he asks.

36
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:04,933
But sir, this is ridiculous...

37
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:08,376
We all have to help in this, Meadows. Roll up your sleeve.

38
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,109
STOP HIM!

39
00:06:15,215 --> 00:06:16,646
Now get him in this chair.

40
00:06:18,786 --> 00:06:27,055
Jean, send for the police. All right Doctor, go ahead!

41
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,764
Roll up his left sleeve.

42
00:06:41,461 --> 00:06:42,279
Don't touch it!

43
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:56,084
Ah, I see. Right. Now then, you are going to answer all my questions. And in return, I promise no harm will come to you. Do you understand?

44
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:57,335
All right.

45
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:01,340
Where are your planes taking all their passengers?

46
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:06,816
There's a... satellite, about a hundred and fifty miles up.

47
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:09,402
Why are you abducting all these young people?

48
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:18,829
We had a catastrophe on our planet. A gigantic explosion. As you've seen, we have lost our identities. My people are dying out!

49
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,985
But what use would our people be to you?

50
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:28,940
Our scientists devised a process so that we could take on the physical characterises of another being.

51
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,206
This is part of the process?

52
00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:31,946
Yes, that's why you mustn't touch it.

53
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:35,500
How many of these young people do you hope to abduct?

54
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,119
This time - Fifty thousand.

55
00:07:39,394 --> 00:07:40,755
Fifty thousand!

56
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,791
How large is this satellite?

57
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:47,442
On the journey in our planes, the passengers are miniaturised.

58
00:07:47,996 --> 00:07:52,822
I see. How many of your people are working here at Gatwick Airport?

59
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:54,040
I don't know.

60
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,157
That's the truth, I tell you. I don't know.

61
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:03,730
Very well. What happens to the people whose identities have been taken over, the originals?

62
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:08,188
They're somewhere in the Airport, I... I don't know exactly where.

63
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:10,412
I'll have the whole place torn to pieces to find them.

64
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:11,592
No, you mustn't find them.

65
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:12,660
Why not?

66
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:15,005
You... you mustn't, that's all.

67
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,117
Because if we do find them we'll find one of these on their arms, eh?

68
00:08:18,358 --> 00:08:21,761
And if we remove it, something terrible will happen to you?

69
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,676
Yes.

70
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:24,555
What if you have to change back?

71
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:28,146
Well, that can be done, but with the machine.

72
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:30,454
The machine in the Medical Centre?

73
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:36,491
Yes. None of us know where our own originals are. Except that Nurse.

74
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:39,061
Nurse? What about her?

75
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:42,056
Oh she was cunning. She's got her own original with her.

76
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,365
Where is it?

77
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:44,637
I don't know.

78
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:46,342
I think you do know.

79
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,154
Now, are you going to tell me?

80
00:08:48,337 --> 00:08:49,536
It's in the Medical Centre.

81
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:52,372
Right. You're going to show me where it is.

82
00:08:52,537 --> 00:08:54,474
I... I daren't. She'll have me destroyed.

83
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:57,041
Are you going to co-operate or are you not?

84
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:06,272
All right. It won't make any difference. You'll never see those fifty thousand young people again!

85
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,723
I think I'd better take him down there - the Medical Centre.

86
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:38,184
What is it?

87
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:41,021
This girl. What do we do with her?

88
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:50,446
We need to use her as an original. That way we can get one of our people close to the man who is menacing us. He will then be killed.

89
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:54,446
But surely Captain Blade isn't bringing any more of our people to Earth...

90
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,371
Can I help you?

91
00:10:01,236 --> 00:10:02,681
Bring him in.

92
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:06,727
I'm afraid I don't understand.

93
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:09,611
I think you two have something in common.

94
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:11,646
Is this man ill, officer?

95
00:10:11,993 --> 00:10:13,345
Roll up your sleeves.

96
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:14,849
What are you talking about?

97
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:15,881
Officer!

98
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,044
Please take your hands off me.

99
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:23,872
Certainly. I've seen all I want to see. I'll have that, if you don't mind!

100
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:29,603
Now then, where is her original?

101
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:31,024
It's in there.

102
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,926
You can't go in there!

103
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,116
Would you rather be destroyed?

104
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:36,795
Keep an eye on her, officer.

105
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:38,103
Bring him along.

106
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:47,463
Sam! Sam, are you all right? Are you all right Sam!

107
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,705
I thought I was done for there. Pins and needles...

108
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,650
You're lucky it was no worse.

109
00:10:57,729 --> 00:10:59,061
What are you doing?

110
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,580
Just checking up!

111
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:04,521
Now then, where is the Nurse's original?

112
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:07,900
It's in a panel in the wall, somewhere. The control's in the couch there.

113
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:09,829
All right, Officer.

114
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,763
Flipping heck! But she's in there!

115
00:11:44,457 --> 00:11:45,806
You traitor!

116
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:46,615
Look out!

117
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:01,104
It's all right Sam. It's all right.

118
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:02,991
She's vanished!

119
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:03,975
Doctor.

120
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:08,296
Put her on here.

121
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,408
There we are. Will there be any permanent damage?

122
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:17,192
No.

123
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:18,591
You can take that off now.

124
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:29,797
It's all right. You'll be quite all right in a few minutes. There.

125
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:41,199
Doctor, what's happened to Jamie?

126
00:12:41,406 --> 00:12:42,961
What on Earth are these doing here?

127
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:48,883
Doctor, Jamie wasn't anywhere near the kiosk the last time... LOOK YOU'RE NOT LISTENING. I THINK THEY'VE GOT JAMIE!

128
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,488
Jamie! Where?!

129
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:52,728
Well you should know. You got him to pinch me ticket!

130
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:53,797
Pinch your ticket?

131
00:12:53,965 --> 00:12:55,477
To stop me from going to Rome.

132
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:56,820
Oh you mean Jamie...

133
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:58,575
Has gone in my place.

134
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:03,761
First Polly and Ben, and now Jamie. We've no time to lose.

135
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:27,496
Inspector!

136
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,293
Let's see if I can get you out of there.

137
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,758
How did you get here?

138
00:13:34,164 --> 00:13:37,516
I... I came on the plane, stole someone's ticket.

139
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:40,354
You ought to have been miniaturised on the journey.

140
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:42,008
Min... miniaturised?

141
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:48,820
Reduced in size - like all the youngsters in these cabins. Did you not have anything to eat or drink?

142
00:13:49,017 --> 00:13:50,684
No, I... I felt too ill!

143
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:54,183
That explains it. The food is the first part of the process.

144
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,715
Inspector, what is this place?

145
00:13:56,911 --> 00:14:08,811
A satellite, Jamie. A flying ship in space. These people are from another planet. It seems the Doctor was right after all. Does anyone down there believe him yet?

146
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:11,520
Oh I... I'm not sure. I... I don't think so.

147
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:17,853
I suppose it is too much for them to believe. But surely the Doctor's convinced them that something is going on?

148
00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:20,639
Aye, I think maybe the Commandant...

149
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,806
Yes, Jamie.

150
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,291
Inspector, have you escaped or something?

151
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:26,759
No-one escapes from here.

152
00:14:27,077 --> 00:14:31,438
But the plane that comes here. Well it must go back to Earth. We could get on it!

153
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:36,463
The last plane to Earth is leaving now. They've just gone back to pick up their own people.

154
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:39,768
Surely the Doctor will think of some way of rescuing us.

155
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:47,060
Not this time, Jamie. This time, he's up against a mind superior even to his. The mind of the Director.

156
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:50,488
You mean someone clever than the Doctor?

157
00:14:50,753 --> 00:14:53,166
The man in charge of this whole mission.

158
00:14:53,346 --> 00:14:55,671
You seem to know a lot about it, Inspector.

159
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:59,685
Of course I do, Jamie. I am the Director!

160
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:44,790
This is the bearing where the Chameleon plane vanished. I want to know if it reappears there. They've a flight due any minute.

161
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:45,716
Very good sir.

162
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:47,548
Now then Doctor, what's all this about personnel files?

163
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:48,795
Over here, I'll show you.

164
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:57,040
I found these in the Medical Centre. Records of twenty-five people who work here. Each one of these has been taken over by Chameleons.

165
00:15:57,751 --> 00:16:03,684
Right. I'll have them all under arrest within fifteen minutes! Airport Police please. Now look at this.

166
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:04,552
What is it?

167
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:05,821
Chameleon Air Schedules.

168
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:10,841
You see here their last flight of the season goes in an hour. Er.. Superintendent Reynolds please.

169
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,075
The last flight? Well that's exactly why they mustn't be arrested.

170
00:16:14,282 --> 00:16:15,599
Superintendent? Commandant here.

171
00:16:15,802 --> 00:16:16,634
Will you please listen to me!

172
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:17,873
Will you hold on a moment please?

173
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:19,381
These people must not be arrested.

174
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:20,367
Why not?

175
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:34,562
Somewhere in outer space, there are fifty thousand young people, three of my friends amongst them, and somehow we've got to bring them back. I want to get on this last flight, which means the Chameleons must think that everything is going according to plan.

176
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:35,719
Commandant?

177
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:40,185
Reynolds, I'll call you back. Now what is it?

178
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,977
This blip. It's just appeared out of nowhere and it's coming this way!

179
00:16:45,263 --> 00:16:48,376
Right well keep tracking them. It may be the Chameleon plane returning.

180
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,454
Now look here, Doctor. All very well talking about getting on that plane, but how?

181
00:16:55,564 --> 00:17:01,278
At the moment, you look like a man called Meadows. Could you shed that identity and become somebody else?

182
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:06,458
Yes. Yes, some of our people have been processed twice.

183
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:11,208
Good. Then in that case I shall pretend I am a Chameleon, and get on board that way.

184
00:17:11,384 --> 00:17:13,689
But even if you get on that plane, what do you hope to do?

185
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:20,955
I don't know until I get to the satellite... and then I will have one card to play. And that's up to you Commandant.

186
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:21,927
What's that?

187
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:28,437
The people the Chameleons have taken over, the originals, are hidden somewhere here in Gatwick Airport. You have got to find them.

188
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:30,545
Of course, and get those fearful things off their arms.

189
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:38,076
No, no, no! Find them, by all means, but don't tamper with those arm sheaths. Otherwise we lose our one threat - the one thing I may be able to bargain with!

190
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:39,333
Yes I see that.

191
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:43,915
But I still don't see how you're going to get on that plane, let alone convince them that you're one of their people.

192
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,359
That will depend entirely on Nurse Pinto.

193
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:50,588
Jean, get onto Superintendent. Reynolds.

194
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:58,470
Now is everything clear? You're sure you understand what I am asking you to do?

195
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,829
Yes, of course, but we've got to think of those young people.

196
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:11,438
How very convenient. Lock the door.

197
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:16,273
No, don't shoot! This is Meadows. He had to be re-processed.

198
00:18:18,017 --> 00:18:19,239
Why?

199
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:28,185
The Doctor became too suspicious of me as Meadows. I was able to kidnap him. The rest is as you can see.

200
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:37,763
A pity. It was useful having someone in Air Traffic Control. But then of course we have possession of the Doctor's brain.

201
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:40,306
You think that will be useful?

202
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,142
Undoubtedly.

203
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,270
That means that you'll be taking us up to the satellite?

204
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:54,165
I am taking everybody back to the satellite on the next plane. It's the last flight. Surely you haven't forgotten that?

205
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:58,583
The re-processing. It's difficult to remember details.

206
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:01,657
Yes, of course, I understand.

207
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:05,267
What have you done with his original?

208
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,935
In a safe place.

209
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:08,524
It should be with the others.

210
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,369
Tell me where that is and I'll have it transferred.

211
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:17,278
There's no time for that now. Jenkins will see you through Immigration.

212
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:20,575
We leave in fifteen minutes.

213
00:19:25,317 --> 00:19:27,435
Do you think we convinced him?

214
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:32,392
I don't know. However we've got aboard that plane. Come on, don't let's be late.

215
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:36,790
Right. Thank you.

216
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:40,665
That was the police, sir. They say the passengers are now boarding the Chameleon plane.

217
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,587
Did they see if the Doctor had got on board?

218
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,084
Yes. He was with Nurse Pinto. All the passengers are adults and most of them have been identified as airport personnel.

219
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:52,069
Commandant. Chameleon plane's requesting clearance for start up.

220
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:56,037
All right Heslington, normal procedure. Give them clearance.

221
00:19:58,068 --> 00:20:01,177
Chameleon Three-Four-Five, stand by for start temperature...

222
00:20:11,782 --> 00:20:17,025
Yes. Now it's stationary. It must be ascending vertically.

223
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,279
The blip's getting fainter, sir. That means he's rising above our radar umbrella.

224
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:23,876
Ah Superintendent, the very man.

225
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:25,376
Blip's just gone, sir.

226
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:33,314
Now look, Reynolds. We've got to get every man of your force on that search. There isn't a moment to lose. Time's running out on us.

227
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:51,014
Any luck?

228
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:53,306
No. Look at that! Wish my files were as neat as that!

229
00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:55,102
How about you. What about the kiosk?

230
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:56,770
Not much. Just a few papers.

231
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:59,535
Hmm... Oh we'd better get back to Air Traffic Control then.

232
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:09,199
Well.

233
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:10,571
Just a few papers sir.

234
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,004
Well, there might be a clue there.

235
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:15,556
Commandant, surely they'd put them somewhere... I mean, well somewhere we'd never think of.

236
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:25,482
We've got to think of it, Jean, wherever it is. The Doctor's relying on us. Thousands of lives are depending on us finding those originals - and quickly!

237
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:29,375
How much longer, Doctor?

238
00:21:29,637 --> 00:21:35,868
I don't know. I should think we're almost there. Don't worry.

239
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:27,899
One moment! Owing to the complete success of our operation, living space on our satellite has had to be used for our... cargo. Therefore, quarters will be re-allocated. Report to the accommodation centre for instructions.

240
00:22:31,153 --> 00:22:32,751
Do you think he's suspects?

241
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,349
I don't know. Let's follow the others.

242
00:22:41,103 --> 00:22:42,306
What is your name?

243
00:22:47,797 --> 00:22:50,012
Try again, What is your name?

244
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:51,474
Jamie.

245
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:53,528
Where do you come from?

246
00:22:53,829 --> 00:22:56,828
From Earth, a place called Scotland.

247
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:58,071
Excellent.

248
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:00,384
Director.

249
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:01,426
What is it?

250
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:08,947
We have found two impostors. The Doctor and Nurse Pinto. I want permission to have them destroyed.

251
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:10,157
One moment.

252
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,427
What do you know about the Doctor?

253
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:21,298
He is not of this Earth or of this century. He has travelled through time and space. His knowledge is even greater than ours.

254
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,844
Director, this man is a danger to us, he should be destroyed.

255
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,571
And I say he must live - but as one of us.

256
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:31,115
You will regret it.

257
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:33,893
You have your orders, Captain Blade.

258
00:23:45,517 --> 00:23:47,091
What do we do now?

259
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:50,594
We slip away and see if we can find these young people. Come on.

260
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:59,714
Ah, Captain Blade, we're carrying out your instructions. We're looking for the accommodation centre.

261
00:23:59,945 --> 00:24:05,922
My instructions don't apply to you. You two won't be needing living space.
