1
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:04,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,070
Negative report from Air Sea Rescue, sir.

3
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,944
But with two aircraft ditching, 
there must be some signs of wreckage.

4
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:33,936
Why do you think the Chameleon plane crashed into the sea?

5
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:36,224
Because it disappeared off our radar screen!

6
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:37,728
But it stood still first!

7
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:40,784
Because it must have collided with the RAF plane and dropped like a stone.

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,250
Why do you think that?

9
00:00:42,832 --> 00:00:46,912
You see, when a plane on that radar appears to stand still,

10
00:00:46,976 --> 00:00:49,520
it is in point of fact dropping straight down.

11
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:51,920
- What about straight up? - Oh my dear Doctor! 

12
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:54,912
To get above our radar umbrella like that

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,688
it would have to climb vertically until it was a hundred miles high.

14
00:00:59,152 --> 00:01:01,360
The darned thing would be in outer space.

15
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,800
Exactly!

16
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,360
That plane they sent to follow us. Should we have destroyed it?

17
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,072
We could eliminate a whole squadron of their toy planes

18
00:01:47,104 --> 00:01:48,560
and they'd never get on to us.

19
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:52,080
Their minds can't cope with an operation like this.

20
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:56,400
Remember the teaching of our Director - the intelligence of Earth people

21
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:00,368
is comparable only to that of animals on our planet.

22
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,880
I thought I'd missed one of you. I wondered what happened to you.

23
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,424
- What have you done to them?! - Close that drawer.

24
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,680
No... No... Don't leave me.

25
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,608
Right, thank you.

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,072
Air Sea Rescue say they're still searching but there's no trace yet.

27
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:28,624
Commandant.

28
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:33,408
I see - did the pilot managed to bail out?

29
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:36,352
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,064
They've found the remains of that RAF plane.

31
00:04:40,176 --> 00:04:42,384
The pilot had been electrocuted.

32
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,168
Do you still think these people are from Earth?

33
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,784
I don't know, Doctor. I just don't know what to think.

34
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:52,544
If only there was one solid piece of evidence.

35
00:04:52,912 --> 00:04:55,328
I think it's just come in!

36
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:59,312
Do you mind if I question him? I think I know how to make him talk.

37
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:10,256
You know what this is, don't you?

38
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,056
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh I think you do.

39
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,416
Roll up your sleeve.

40
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:16,272
Do I have to take orders from him, sir?

41
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,096
I think perhaps you should explain, Doctor.

42
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,930
After all, this man is working for me.

43
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,648
You only think he's working for you!

44
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,448
Commandant, your personnel are being systematically replaced. 

45
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,790
And this is how they're doing it.

46
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,872
This is not Meadows, it only looks like Meadows.

47
00:05:29,904 --> 00:05:32,064
He's wearing one of these things on his arm.

48
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,888
Very well, do as he asks.

49
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,288
- But sir, this is ridiculous...
- We all have to help in this

50
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,192
Meadows. Roll up your sleeve.

51
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,400
STOP HIM!

52
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,640
Now get him in this chair.

53
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:48,848
Jean, send for the police.

54
00:05:52,064 --> 00:05:54,528
All right Doctor, go ahead!

55
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,448
Roll up his left sleeve.

56
00:06:00,128 --> 00:06:03,744
There we are. Now then.

57
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:07,920
What happens if I were to turn one of these? 

58
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:08,880
Don't touch it!

59
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,376
Ah, I see. Right.

60
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,704
Now then, you are going to answer all my questions.

61
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:20,048
And in return, I promise no harm will come to you.

62
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,312
- Do you understand?   - All right.

63
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,976
Where are your planes taking all their passengers?

64
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:31,280
There's a... satellite, about a hundred and fifty miles up.

65
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,300
Why are you abducting all these young people?

66
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,110
We had a catastrophe on our planet. A gigantic explosion.

67
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:43,024
As you've seen, we have lost our identities. My people are dying out!

68
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:46,048
But what use would our people be to you?

69
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,160
Our scientists devised a process so that 
we could take on the physical characterises of another being.

70
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:53,392
This is part of the process?

71
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:54,880
Yes, that's why you mustn't touch it.

72
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:58,272
How many of these young people do you hope to abduct?

73
00:06:58,912 --> 00:07:01,440
This time - Fifty thousand.

74
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,280
- Fifty thousand! - How large is this satellite?

75
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:09,520
On the journey in our planes, the passengers are miniaturised.

76
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:14,640
I see. How many of your people are working here at Gatwick Airport?

77
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,240
I don't know. That's the truth, I tell you. I don't know.

78
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:24,816
Very well. What happens to the people whose identities have been taken over, the originals?

79
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,784
They're somewhere in the Airport, I... I don't know exactly where.

80
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,008
I'll have the whole place torn to pieces to find them.

81
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,944
- No, you mustn't find them. -  Why not?

82
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:35,232
You... you mustn't, that's all.

83
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:38,416
Because if we do find them we'll find one of these on their arms, eh?

84
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,936
And if we remove it, something terrible will happen to you?

85
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,670
Yes.

86
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,400
What if you have to change back?

87
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:47,424
Well, that can be done, but with the machine.

88
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:50,450
- The machine in the Medical Centre?  - Yes.

89
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:55,520
None of us know where our own originals are. Except that Nurse.

90
00:07:56,512 --> 00:07:59,060
- Nurse? What about her?  - Oh she was cunning. 

91
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,320
- She's got her own original with her.   - Where is it?

92
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:05,136
- I don't know.   - I think you do know.

93
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,448
- Now, are you going to tell me? - It's in the Medical Centre.

94
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:10,928
Right. You're going to show me where it is.

95
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,960
I... I daren't. She'll have me destroyed.

96
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,740
Are you going to co-operate or are you not?

97
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,960
All right. It won't make any difference.

98
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:23,856
You'll never see those fifty thousand young people again!

99
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:27,220
I think I'd better take him down there - the Medical Centre.

100
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:53,520
What is it?

101
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,304
This girl. What do we do with her?

102
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:59,088
We need to use her as an original. 

103
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,672
That way we can get one of our people 
close to the man who is menacing us.

104
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:04,880
He will then be killed.

105
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:08,752
But surely Captain Blade isn't bringing any more of our people to Earth...

106
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,270
Can I help you?

107
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,580
Bring him in.

108
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,208
I'm afraid I don't understand.

109
00:09:20,304 --> 00:09:22,720
I think you two have something in common.

110
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:25,072
Is this man ill, officer?

111
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,448
Roll up your sleeves.

112
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,544
- What are you talking about?   - Officer!

113
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,960
Please take your hands off me.

114
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:34,096
Certainly. I've seen all I want to see. 

115
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:36,144
I'll have that, if you don't mind!

116
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:42,048
Now then, where is her original?

117
00:09:42,144 --> 00:09:43,168
It's in there.

118
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,448
- You can't go in there! 
- Would you rather be destroyed?

119
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,656
Keep an eye on her, officer.

120
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:49,824
Bring him along.

121
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,176
Sam! Sam, are you all right?

122
00:09:57,616 --> 00:09:59,360
- Are you all right Sam!  - Yes!

123
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,360
I thought I was done for there.

124
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:07,936
- Pins and needles... 
- You're lucky it was no worse.

125
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,424
- What are you doing? - Just checking up!

126
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:14,816
Now then, where is the Nurse's original?

127
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,416
It's in a panel in the wall, somewhere.

128
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:18,096
The control's in the couch there.

129
00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:20,020
All right, Officer.

130
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:32,560
Flipping heck! But she's in there!

131
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,664
You traitor!

132
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,752
Look out!

133
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,760
It's all right Sam. It's all right.

134
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:09,536
She's vanished!

135
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,624
Doctor.

136
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,848
Put her on here.

137
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:18,677
There we are.

138
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:22,928
- Will there be any permanent damage?  - No.

139
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,368
You can take that off now.

140
00:11:30,832 --> 00:11:35,390
It's all right. You'll be quite all right in a few minutes. There.

141
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,790
Doctor, what's happened to Jamie?

142
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:47,712
What on Earth are these doing here?

143
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:50,384
Doctor, Jamie wasn't anywhere near the kiosk the last time...

144
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,200
LOOK YOU'RE NOT LISTENING. I THINK THEY'VE GOT JAMIE!

145
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:55,376
- Jamie! Where?!  - Well you should know.

146
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,616
- You got him to pinch me ticket! 
- Pinch your ticket?

147
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:59,232
To stop me from going to Rome.

148
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,032
- Oh you mean Jamie... 
- Has gone in my place.

149
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,360
First Polly and Ben, and now Jamie.

150
00:12:05,616 --> 00:12:07,440
We've no time to lose.

151
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,064
Inspector!

152
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:31,664
Let's see if I can get you out of there.

153
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:34,944
How did you get here?

154
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,176
I... I came on the plane, stole someone's ticket.

155
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,944
You ought to have been miniaturised on the journey.

156
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,816
Min... miniaturised?

157
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:46,224
Reduced in size - like all the youngsters in these cabins.

158
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,184
Did you not have anything to eat or drink?

159
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:51,120
No, I... I felt too ill!

160
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:54,368
That explains it. The food is the first part of the process.

161
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,608
Inspector, what is this place?

162
00:12:56,928 --> 00:13:00,736
A satellite, Jamie. A flying ship in space.

163
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:04,704
These people are from another planet. 
It seems the Doctor was right after all.

164
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:07,856
Does anyone down there believe him yet?

165
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:10,480
Oh I... I'm not sure. I... I don't think so.

166
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,896
I suppose it is too much for them to believe.

167
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:16,720
But surely the Doctor's convinced them that something is going on?

168
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:19,296
Aye, I think maybe the Commandant...

169
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,240
Yes, Jamie.

170
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:22,832
Inspector, have you escaped or something?

171
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,672
No-one escapes from here.

172
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:26,784
But the plane that comes here.

173
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,568
Well it must go back to Earth. We could get on it!

174
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,680
The last plane to Earth is leaving now.

175
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,096
They've just gone back to pick up their own people.

176
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,104
Surely the Doctor will think of some way of rescuing us.

177
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,480
Not this time, Jamie.

178
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,144
This time, he's up against a mind superior even to his.

179
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:44,208
The mind of the Director.

180
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,024
You mean someone clever than the Doctor?

181
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,152
The man in charge of this whole mission.

182
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,552
You seem to know a lot about it, Inspector.

183
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:55,472
Of course I do, Jamie. I am the Director!

184
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,920
This is the bearing where the Chameleon plane vanished.

185
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:38,592
I want to know if it reappears there. They've a flight due any minute.

186
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,392
Very good sir.

187
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,344
Now then Doctor, what's all this about personnel files?

188
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:42,400
Over here, I'll show you.

189
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,472
I found these in the Medical Centre.

190
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,584
Records of twenty-five people who work here.

191
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,208
Each one of these has been taken over by Chameleons.

192
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,592
Right. I'll have them all under arrest within fifteen minutes!

193
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,880
- Airport Police please. Now look at this.   - What is it?

194
00:14:56,992 --> 00:14:58,256
Chameleon Air Schedules.

195
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,680
You see here their last flight of the season goes in an hour.

196
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:03,240
Er.. Superintendent Reynolds please.

197
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:06,080
The last flight? Well that's exactly why they mustn't be arrested.

198
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:07,648
Superintendent? Commandant here.

199
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,440
- Will you please listen to me! 
- Will you hold on a moment please?

200
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:11,728
- These people must not be arrested. - Why not?

201
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:13,728
Somewhere in outer space,

202
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,944
there are fifty thousand young people, three of my friends amongst them,

203
00:15:16,992 --> 00:15:18,864
and somehow we've got to bring them back.

204
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,632
I want to get on this last flight,

205
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:25,560
which means the Chameleons must think that 
everything is going according to plan.

206
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:26,544
Commandant?

207
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,328
Reynolds, I'll call you back.

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,280
Now what is it?

209
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,360
This blip. It's just appeared out of nowhere and it's coming this way!

210
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,448
Right well keep tracking them. It may be the Chameleon plane returning.

211
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:39,891
Now look here, Doctor.

212
00:15:40,016 --> 00:15:42,864
All very well talking about getting on that plane, but how?

213
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:47,680
At the moment, you look like a man called Meadows.

214
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:50,970
Could you shed that identity and become somebody else?

215
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,512
Yes. Yes, some of our people have been processed twice.

216
00:15:54,608 --> 00:16:00,048
Good. Then in that case I shall pretend 
I am a Chameleon, and get on board that way.

217
00:16:00,144 --> 00:16:02,380
But even if you get on that plane, what do you hope to do?

218
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:07,728
I don't know until I get to the satellite... and then I will have one card to play.

219
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,080
- And that's up to you Commandant. - What's that?

220
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,024
The people the Chameleons have taken over, the originals,

221
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,190
are hidden somewhere here in Gatwick Airport.

222
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,320
- You have got to find them.
-  Of course, and get those fearful things off their arms.

223
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,696
No, no, no! Find them, by all means, but don't tamper with those arm sheaths.

224
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,280
Otherwise we lose our one threat - the one thing I may be able to bargain with!

225
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:28,304
Yes I see that. But I still don't see how you're going to get on that plane, 

226
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:30,688
let alone convince them that you're one of their people.

227
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,504
That will depend entirely on Nurse Pinto.

228
00:16:34,432 --> 00:16:37,472
Jean, get onto Superintendent. Reynolds.

229
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,488
Now is everything clear?

230
00:16:42,096 --> 00:16:44,370
You're sure you understand what I am asking you to do?

231
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:48,720
Yes, of course, but we've got to think of those young people.

232
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:55,008
How very convenient.

233
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,968
- Lock the door.  - No, don't shoot! 

234
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,648
This is Meadows. He had to be re-processed.

235
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:04,032
Why?

236
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,608
The Doctor became too suspicious of me as Meadows.

237
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,432
I was able to kidnap him. The rest is as you can see.

238
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:17,728
A pity. It was useful having someone in Air Traffic Control.

239
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,712
But then of course we have possession of the Doctor's brain.

240
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:23,920
You think that will be useful?

241
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,040
Undoubtedly.

242
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,648
That means that you'll be taking us up to the satellite?

243
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,088
I am taking everybody back to the satellite on the next plane.

244
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:37,152
It's the last flight. Surely you haven't forgotten that?

245
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:41,456
The re-processing. It's difficult to remember details.

246
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,256
Yes, of course, I understand.

247
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,296
What have you done with his original?

248
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,960
In a safe place.

249
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:50,480
It should be with the others.

250
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:53,216
Tell me where that is and I'll have it transferred.

251
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,056
There's no time for that now.

252
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:58,784
Jenkins will see you through Immigration.

253
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:01,904
We leave in fifteen minutes.

254
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,424
- Do you think we convinced him?  - I don't know.

255
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,360
However we've got aboard that plane.
Come on, don't let's be late.

256
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,248
Right. Thank you.

257
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,928
That was the police, sir. They say the passengers are now boarding the Chameleon plane.

258
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,816
Did they see if the Doctor had got on board?

259
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,696
Yes. He was with Nurse Pinto. All the passengers are adults

260
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:27,936
and most of them have been identified as airport personnel.

261
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:31,696
Commandant. Chameleon plane's requesting clearance for start up.

262
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:35,664
All right Heslington, normal procedure. Give them clearance.

263
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:40,576
Chameleon Three-Four-Five, stand by for start temperature...

264
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:55,536
Yes. Now it's stationary. It must be ascending vertically.

265
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,600
The blip's getting fainter, sir. That means he's rising above our radar umbrella.

266
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,870
Ah Superintendent, the very man.

267
00:19:01,904 --> 00:19:04,160
- Blip's just gone, sir. - Now look, Reynolds.

268
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,680
We've got to get every man of your force on that search.

269
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:10,848
There isn't a moment to lose. Time's running out on us.

270
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,304
- Any luck?  - No. Look at that!

271
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,320
Wish my files were as neat as that! How about you.

272
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:32,800
- What about the kiosk? - Not much. Just a few papers.

273
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:35,504
Hmm... Oh we'd better get back to Air Traffic Control then.

274
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,648
- Well?  -  Just a few papers sir.

275
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:47,216
Well, there might be a clue there.

276
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,008
Commandant, surely they'd put them somewhere... I mean,

277
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,560
well somewhere we'd never think of.

278
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,288
We've got to think of it, Jean, wherever it is. The Doctor's relying on us.

279
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,256
Thousands of lives are depending on us finding those originals - and quickly!

280
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,720
- How much longer, Doctor?  - I don't know.

281
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:10,144
I should think we're almost there. Don't worry.

282
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,296
One moment!

283
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:47,168
Owing to the complete success of our operation,

284
00:20:47,392 --> 00:20:51,936
living space on our satellite has had to be used for our... cargo.

285
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,056
Therefore, quarters will be re-allocated.

286
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:58,600
Report to the accommodation centre for instructions.

287
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:03,152
Do you think he's suspects?

288
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,736
I don't know. Let's follow the others.

289
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,550
What is your name?

290
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,584
Try again, What is your name?

291
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,020
Jamie.

292
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,070
Where do you come from?

293
00:21:23,312 --> 00:21:26,128
From Earth, a place called Scotland.

294
00:21:26,336 --> 00:21:27,328
Excellent.

295
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,224
- Director.  - What is it?

296
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,912
We have found two impostors. 
The Doctor and Nurse Pinto.

297
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,470
I want permission to have them destroyed.

298
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,848
One moment. What do you know about the Doctor?

299
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,536
He is not of this Earth or of this century.

300
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,080
He has travelled through time and space.

301
00:21:46,688 --> 00:21:48,928
His knowledge is even greater than ours.

302
00:21:49,232 --> 00:21:52,544
Director, this man is a danger to us, he should be destroyed.

303
00:21:53,264 --> 00:21:56,032
And I say he must live - but as one of us.

304
00:21:56,752 --> 00:21:58,336
You will regret it.

305
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:00,928
You have your orders, Captain Blade.

306
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,232
What do we do now?

307
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:16,656
We slip away and see if we can find these young people. Come on.

308
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,896
Ah, Captain Blade, we're carrying out your instructions.

309
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:25,392
We're looking for the accommodation centre.

310
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,016
My instructions don't apply to you.

311
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,280
You two won't be needing living space.
