你确定从来没见过他们？他们说认识你
You're quite sure you've never met these men?
They say they know you.

3
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,830
但他们不可能认识我，这是我第一次来英国！
But they can't know me.
This is my first visit to England!

4
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,670

我叫 Michelle Leuppi，来自苏黎世

7
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:47,960
你有护照吗？
You have a passport?

8
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:49,584
有，当然有，这里
Yes, of course. Here.

9
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:53,120
我做错什么了吗？
Have I done something wrong?

10
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:57,184
哦没有，我觉得这里没有什么你需要担心的，小姐
Oh no, I don't suppose there's anything
for you to worry about, Miss.

11
00:01:58,448 --> 00:02:01,400
我可以问问你来英国做什么？
May I just ask what you're doing in England?

12
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,496
我是来工作的。看，这是我的工作许可

14
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:11,984
打扰了
Excuse me.

15
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,424
你在那里学的这么好的英语？

我有一个英语家庭教师

00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:19,792
你介意告诉这是怎么一回事吗？

没什么需要你操心的，小姐，一切都没问题
Nothing that need concern you, miss,
everything's perfectly in order.

19
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,304
现在你可以从这边走了
Now if you'd just like to go through there?

20
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,200
谢谢你
Thank you.

21
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,130
Polly，等等！
Polly, wait!

22
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,250
你先等等，年轻人

但她是我们的朋友啊——她还看见了那场谋杀！
But she's a friend of ours - and she saw the murder!

24
00:02:31,456 --> 00:02:34,570
你们俩得待在这里，直到警司到了这里
You're going to wait here until the Superintendent
of police arrives //

25
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:35,570
现在明白了吗？
now understand that?

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,300
啊，你要告诉他那具死尸的事情，非常明智
Ah, you're going to tell him
about the dead body, very sensible.

27
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,120
不，我要告诉他你们的事情
No. I am going to tell him about you.

28
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,616
给我接 Reynolds 警司
Put me through to Superintendent Reynolds.

29
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:47,728
Jamie，我觉得我们在这里不是太受欢迎
Jamie, I don't think we're very welcome here.

30
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,424
等我说跑的时候，就跑
When I say run, we run!

31
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,583
你好，警司，我是总指挥
Hello Super, Commandant.

32
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:54,448
我这里有两个非法入境者

34
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:58,080
跑！
Run!

35
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,344
总指挥！
Commandant!

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,208
情况有变，他们刚刚逃跑了
Situation changed. They've just made a run for it.

37
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,590
我把他们详细描述给你...
I'll give you their description...

38
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,600
快！他要窒息了
Quick! He's suffocating.

39
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,780
你们晚了20分钟
You were twenty minutes late.

40
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,460
他是谁？
Who is he?

41

Meadows，是航空控制塔台的
Meadows - Air Traffic Control.

42
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,350
很好！他可能对我们有用
Good! He may be useful to us.

43
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,910
他们还在搜寻我们，博士
They're still hunting for us, Doctor.

44
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,760
是的，我们必须躲着他们，知道我们能自圆其说
Yes. We'll have to keep out of their way
until we can prove our story.

45
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,180
本来有一个很好的机会证明的
A fine chance we have of doing that - //

46
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,980
但Polly居然开玩笑说她不认识我们！
with Polly kidding on she doesn't know us!

47
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,690
我不觉得 Polly 是在开玩笑
I don't think Polly was kidding on.

48
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,890
事实上，我觉得那不是 Polly
In fact, I don't think that was Polly.

49
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,290
当然是，就是 Polly！你都看见了！
Of course, it was Polly! You saw her!

50
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,976
你不应该相信所有你说看见的事情，Jamie
You don't want to believe everything you see, Jamie.

51
00:04:57,056 --> 00:04:57,824
博士
Doctor!

52
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,552
没事了，博士
All clear, Doctor.

53
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:09,760
博士！
Doctor!

54
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,780
Jamie，那个机库的名字叫什么？
Jamie, what was the name of that hangar?

55
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:13,780
Polly 说过变色龙什么的
Polly said Chameleon something.

56
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,800
是这个，变色龙观光游
Yes, Chameleon Tours.

57
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:20,480
这是变色龙青年观光游的广告
An advertisement for Chameleon Youth Tours.

58
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,736
年轻人的廉价旅游，为18-25岁量身定做
"Budget Tours for young people
between the ages of eighteen and twenty five. "

59
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,728
- 廉价是什么意思？
- What do they mean by budget?

60
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,340
费用少，便宜！ 这可能是诱饵
Inexpensive, cheap! This could be the bait.

61
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:33,536
你知道变色龙是什么吗，Jamie?
Do you know what a chameleon is, Jamie?

62
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:35,152
只是个名字吧，我估计？
It's just a name, I suppose?

63
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,328
是一种小动物的名字，一种蜥蜴
It is the name of a small animal, a lizard

64
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:40,176
它能改变它身体的颜色，以与周边环境融为一体
that can change its colour
to merge with its background.

65
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,912
但这个名字一样可用在人身上
But it's a name that could equally
be applied to people as well.

66
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,072
有些人为了自己的目的会改变自己的特性
People who change their personalities
to suit their own ends.

67
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,648
廉价旅游...为18-25岁年轻人
Budget Tours... young people
between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five

68
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,272
Oh yes, there's something strange going on here.

69
00:05:56,336 --> 00:05:58,304
- 博士！Jamie！  - Ben！你没事吧
- Doctor! Jamie!  - Ben! Are you all right?

70
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,856
- 嗯，我没事 - 那还真松了一口气
- Yeah, I'm okay.  - Well that's a relief.

71
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:01,536
你们俩怎么了？Polly 又在哪儿？
What happened to you two and where's Polly?

72
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,624
我们不能在这里聊，得找个地方躲起来
We can't talk here.//
We've got to find somewhere to hide.

73
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,504
躲那些找我们要护照的
Something about passports.

74
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:09,030
我正好有个地方，快来
I've got the very place. Come on.

75
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:33,376
他没事吧
Is he all right?

76
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:34,400
看看吧
We'll see.

77
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,760
读第一行
Read the first line!

78
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:58,000
发声控制器

79
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,008
试试那个
Try that.

80
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:10,768
H... X... O... A...

81
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:31,088
都搞定了
All complete.

82
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,830
你是谁？
Who are you?

83
00:07:38,464 --> 00:07:40,720
我的名字是George Meadows
My name is George Meadows.

84
00:07:41,264 --> 00:07:44,304
我在航空控制塔台工作，盖特威克机场

85
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,960

88
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,072
在上周之前，我们住在34号
Until last week, We lived at Number Thirty-Four.

89
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:59,540
我前一段太忙，还没有将这个变化通知人事部门
I've been too busy to tell
the Personnel Department of the change.

90
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,160
太棒了！
Excellent!

91
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:20,680
- 快看！那是Polly!  - 是的
- Look! There's Polly!  - Yes.

92
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:22,800
你看她在给谁干活！

93
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:24,672
- 变色龙观光旅游  - 是的

94
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:26,768
把这交给我吧
Leave this to me.

95

请走开
Please go away.

97
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,255
看，你肯定出事了，Polly
Now, something has happened to you, Polly.

98
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,600
我期望你尽力回忆一下，我们离开机库之前的事情
I want you to try to remember
up to the time we left the hangar.

99
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,630
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

100
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,824
想想，Polly。当时我们三个在机库
Now think, Polly.
There were three of us in the hangar.

101
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,528
你让我们看了点东西，是什么？
You were showing us something. Now what was it?

102
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,384
我跟你说，我不知道你在说些什么
I tell you, I don't know what you're talking about.

103
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,896
机库，Polly，变色龙的机库
The hangar, Polly, The Chameleon Hangar.

104
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:55,580
你说你还看见了是谁干的
You said you'd seen the man who did it.

105
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,720
我什么也没看见，我猜你是疯了
I didn't see anything. I think you're mad.

106
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,136
如果我看见谁被枪杀了，我会去找警察的...
If I'd seen anyone shot,
I'd have gone to the police...

107
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:02,080
谁被枪杀了？
Anyone shot?

108
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
我...我是说被谋害了
I... I mean murdered...

109
00:09:05,776 --> 00:09:08,128
我可没说有人被枪杀或者被谋害了，Polly
I didn't say anyone was shot, or murdered, Polly.

110
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:10,272
求你了，能不能别烦我
Look, please, will you just leave me alone.

111
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:14,912
她这是怎么了，博士？
What's happened to her, Doctor?

112
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:17,287
我不知道，但我打算查明白
I don't know. But I mean to find out.

113
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:20,330
快来，我们找一个可以说话的地方
Come on, let's find that place where we can talk.

114
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:28,256
到这里面来
Come in here.

115
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
我本来正要跟你交待这个任务的
I was going to brief you for this assignment,

116
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:36,780
但现在没什么必要了
but there isn't any purpose, now.

117
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:38,992
是我搞砸了吗？
I have failed, then?

118
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:41,338
环境对你不利
Circumstances are against you.

119
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,392
我会安排你搭下一航班离开
I'll make arrangements for you
to leave on the next flight.

120
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,328
回基地？
Back to base?

121
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:48,720
是的
Yes.

122
00:09:50,032 --> 00:09:52,736
这个人怎么办？他很执着
What about that man? He's very persistent.

123
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,072
不用担心他
Don't worry about him.

124
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,992
我们有好多方法对付这样的人
We have ways of dealing with such people...

125
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,400
你确定你没有见过他，先生？
Are you sure you haven't seen him, sir?

126
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:30,032
我相当确定
I'm quite sure!

127
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:32,516
哦，Jean, 这位是 Crossland 督察
Oh Jean, this is Detective Inspector Crossland.//

128
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:34,016
尽你所能给他一些协助
Give him any help you can.

129
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:35,888
- 那我先告辞了？  - 好的，当然，先生
- If you'll excuse me? - Yes, of course, sir.

130
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:39,472
好了，督察，有什么可以帮你的？
Well now Inspector, what can I do for you?

131
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,380
哦，我想首先我需要一张通行证
Well, I think I'll need a pass for a start.

132
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,880
哦，这很容易安排
Well that's easily arranged.

133
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,100
还有什么吗？
Anything else?

134
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:46,560
有，本来我是要在这里跟我的一个同事碰面的
Yes, I was supposed to meet a colleague of mine here,

135
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:48,480
- 一位叫 Gascoigne 的督察  - 怎么了？
- a Detective Inspector Gascoigne.   - Yes?

136
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:50,775
哦，他正在调查一个人口失踪案
Oh, he was investigating a missing person //

137
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:52,475
你们这里一趟租赁航班
off one of your charter flights.

138
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:54,336
但奇怪的是，他没出现
The funny thing is, he hasn't shown up!

139
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,952
Crossland 督察
Detective-Inspector Crossland...

140
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:57,680
我能问问你这次的公务是。。。？
What shall I say your business is?

141
00:10:57,776 --> 00:11:01,840
调查变色龙青年旅游
Investigation into Chameleon Youth Tours.

142
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:20,864
这是什么地方
What is this place?

143
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:22,530
这是一台给你们拍照片的机器
It's a machine that takes your photograph.

144
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:23,560
照片？
Photograph?

145
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:25,122
喏，你看你得...
Well, you see you've got...

146
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,492
别 Ben，现在别
No Ben, not now. //

147
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,492
我想不通的是，这女孩试图假扮成 Polly，但是...
What puzzles me is this girl
pretending to be Polly, yet...

148
00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:30,210
某种程度上来说，她又是 Polly
yet in a way, she is Polly.

149
00:11:30,304 --> 00:11:31,690
你觉得她会是被洗脑了吗？
Do you think she's been brainwashed?

150
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,028
不，时间不够
No, not in the time.

151
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,144
不管她遭遇了什么，都在短短几分钟之内。小心！
Whatever happened to her happened to her
in a few minutes. Look out!

152
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,304
没事了。Ben，Jamie
All right. Now Ben, Jamie,

153
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,304
我们必须得去多找一些变色龙观光游的情况
we've got to find out
more about Chameleon Youth Tours,

154
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:49,448
不过问题是，我们没法自由行动
but the trouble is, we're not free to move around//

155
00:11:49,564 --> 00:11:51,248
当局还在找我们
with the authorities looking for us.

156
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:52,720
对了，他们并没有在找我
Well, they're not looking for me.

157
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:56,176
嗯，那倒是，你可以去机库调查
Well, that's true. You could investigate the hangar.

158
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:57,344
就交给我吧。那你们呢？
Leave it to me. Now what about you?

159
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:58,892
我要回去找总指挥
I'm going back to the Commandant

160
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:01,472
尽力说服他这里有个凶手
and try and convince him that there's a murderer abroad.

161
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:02,832
那我跟 Ben 一起去
Well I'll go with Ben.

162
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:04,456
不，Jamie，我要你原路返回
No, Jamie, I want you to find your way back//

163
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:07,056
到变色龙柜台去盯着点 Polly
to the Chameleon kiosk and keep an eye on Polly.

164
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,900
再次通知飞往日内瓦的 BR129 航班
Further call for flight BR129 to Geneva...

165
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,100
现在开始在19号登机口B通道登机
now boarding through channel B at gate number 19.

166
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,104
哦！这里是你负责吗？
Oh! Err, are you in charge here?

167
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:00,896
啊，是的，有什么可以帮你的？
Ah, yes. Can I help you?

168
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,808
有，我叫 Samatha Briggs，我从利物浦来的
Yes. I... I'm Samantha Briggs
and I've come down from Liverpool.

169
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:05,648
哦，真的啊
Oh, really?

170
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:08,560
是关于我弟弟的事情，他叫 Brian Brigg
It's about my brother, Brian Briggs -

171
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,496
他怎么了？
What about him?

172
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,590
他来参加你们的一个观光旅游，但他现在不见了
He went on one of your tours,
and now he's disappeared.

173
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,760
对不起，我没明白
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

174
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,952
哎，这真的很简单
Well, it's really very simple.

175
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:23,248
你们送他去的那个酒店，我试图去找它的电话号码
I tried to get the telephone number
of the hotel you sent him to,

176
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,350
但接线员说没有这样一个地方
and the operator said there was no such place.

177
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,016
哦，接线员肯定搞错了
Well, the operator must have been mistaken then.

178
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,560
于是...我就联系了警方
So... I got in touch with the police

179
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:36,144
然后他们说 Brian 不在罗马的任何一个酒店里
and they said that Brian
wasn't staying at any hotel in Rome.

180
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:41,360
哦，也许他改主意了，然后跑去了别的旅游团
Well, um, perhaps he changed his mind
and decided to go on a different tour then.

181
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,320
那你看看这个怎么说？
Well what about this then?

182
00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:48,880
Brian 寄来的明信片，从罗马寄来的！
A post-card from Brian, posted in Rome!

183
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,056
是，这看起来有点奇怪，是不？
Yes, that does seem odd, doesn't it?

184
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:55,340
呃，我帮你查查你看可以吗？
Erm, would you like me to make some enquiries for you?

185
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:58,704
那你觉得我大老远从利物浦跑来是为了什么？
Well, what do you think
I've come all the way down from Liverpool for?

186
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:01,904
既然你都把情况告诉警方了，为什么还自己跑来？
Well - since you've put the matter
with the police, why have you?

187
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:05,600
警察，他们说每周都有好几打人失踪
Police. They said that dozens of people
go missing every week

188
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:08,048
而他们没有足够的人全部展开调查
and they haven't got the men to go chasing after them all.

189
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:10,608
我明白了。你说你弟弟的名字叫什么来着？
I see. What did you say your brother's name was?

190
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:16,560
Brian Briggs. 你期望我给你拼出来么？
Brian Briggs. Would you like me to spell it for you?

191
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,344
没必要，谢谢你
That won't be necessary, thank you.

192
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:22,144
我看看我能查出什么来，如果你愿意等的话
I'll see what I can find out, if you don't mind waiting.

193
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,392
Blade 机长在吗不？
Is Captain Blade there?

194
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,570
不在
No.

195
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:36,090
我必须得跟他通话，很紧急
Well, I must speak with him - urgently. //

196
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:39,090
关于一个失踪乘客的事情
Enquiries about a missing passenger.

197
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,450
我会让他跟你联系，不会很久的
I'll tell him to contact you. He shouldn't be long.

198
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,160
我要找的那位先生现在不在
The gentleman I wanted to speak with wasn't available,

199
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,720
他们找他去了。你愿意等一会儿吗？
they're trying to find him. Do you want to wait?

200
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:55,104
我也没有其它事情可做啊，对吧？
Well, I've got nothing else to do, have I?

201
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:56,832
我就在那边
I'll be over there.

202
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:02,800
哦，该死！
Oh blast!

203
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,104
有什么事吗？
Is anything the matter?

204
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,592
自以为是的东西！
Stuck up thing!

205
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,448
- 什么？  - 不是说你
- What?  - Not you.

206
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,056
那个女的，她一点也不在乎
That girl! She just couldn't care less.

207
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,680
找你弟弟的事情
About finding your brother.

208
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,808
- 是  - 我不小心听到了
- Yes.   - I couldn't help overhearing.

209
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:19,824
你觉得他是不是出了什么事？
Do you think something's happened to him.

210
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:22,464
哦，这个问题，我说不好
Well, that's just it, I don't know.

211
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:26,832
哦，Brian 倒是能自己照顾自己，不过还是...
Oh, Brian can take care of himself all right, but still...

212
00:15:26,912 --> 00:15:28,272
是，但愿你是对的
Aye, well I hope you're right.

213
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:31,060
- 你什么意思？  - 我也许可以帮到你
- What d'you mean?  - I might just be able to help you.

214
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,088
但目前我不能告诉任何情况
I can't tell you anything at the moment

215
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,880
但稍后我带你见我一个朋友
but later I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

216
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:36,736
我确信他知道怎样处理最好
I'm sure he'll know what's best.

217
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,540
抱歉，先生
Excuse me, sir.

218
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,590
有位绅士要见你
There's a gentleman to see you.

219
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,950
他说了是什么事吗？
Did he say what about?

220
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:57,480
哦说了，是一具死尸的事
Well yes. It's about a dead body.

221
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:01,860
带他进来吧
Bring him in.

222
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:04,850
- 你可以进来吗？  - 谢谢你
- Would you come in, please?  - Thank you.

223
00:16:06,352 --> 00:16:09,910
啊，总指挥，很高兴再次见到你
Ah, Commandant. How nice to see you again.

224
00:16:10,384 --> 00:16:12,450
请接机场警方
Airport Police please.

225
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,056
至少听听我有什么要说的
At least hear what I have to say.

226
00:16:15,136 --> 00:16:16,800
我已经听够你那些废话了
I've heard all I want to from you.

227
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:18,252
什么意思，他们都占线？
What do you mean, they're engaged. //

228
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:19,952
我是总指挥。谢谢你
This is the Commandant. Thank you.

229
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,912
如果你打算跟警方通话，赶紧告诉他们...
If you're going to speak to the police,
then tell them that

230
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:26,816
机场现在有情况，可能会危及很多人的性命
there's something happening in this airport
that may endanger human lives.

231
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,720
是警方吗？我是总指挥
Hello police? Commandant.

232
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:31,312
请你们能不能立即派几个人过来
Would you send a couple of men down here at once please.

233
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:37,050
既然我马上就要被捕了，能不能提个最后的请求？
Since I'm obviously about to be arrested
may I make one last request?

234
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:39,728
就听我说一分钟
Listen to me for just one minute.

235
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,792
一秒钟也不听
Not for one second.

236
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,560
我已经听够了
I've heard all I want to hear about //

237
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,560
烧焦的纤维、射线枪、消失的尸体。。。
burnt fibres, ray guns, disappearing bodies...

238
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:49,200
但变色龙观光团的机库的确有过一具死尸！
But there was a dead body in the Chameleon Tours hangar!

239
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,448
你刚才是说“变色龙观光团”？
Did you say "Chameleon Tours"?

240
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,528
- 怎么，你知道它一些情况  - 哦，不知道
- Why, do you know something about it?  - Well, no.

241
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,752
但这位 Crossland 督察想要了解...
But the Inspector Crossland wanted to know... //

242
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,152
好了，Jean，我来处理吧
All right, Jean. I'll handle this.

243
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:57,456
啊，把这个人带走，锁起来
Ah, take this man away, put him under lock and key

244
00:16:57,548 --> 00:16:58,656
把他一直关在那儿！
and keep him there!

245
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,320
再走近一步，我就把你们炸成碎片！
One step nearer and I'll blow you all to smithereens!

246
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:04,208
接着！
Catch!

247
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:11,800
好了，去追！
All right, after him!

248
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,850
都相当清楚了吧，是不？
That's quite clear, is it?//

249
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,550
你知道怎么跟她说了？
You know what to tell her?

250
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
我知道
I do.

251
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:21,488
一旦你甩掉这个女孩，就把柜台关了
As soon as you've got rid of the girl, close the kiosk

252
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,360
登上下一班飞机
and get on the next flight.

253
00:17:29,168 --> 00:17:30,640
Briggs 小姐
Miss Briggs.

254
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,700
在，你查到什么了吗？
Yes. Have you found anything?

255
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,973
呃，是的，我查到了
Err, well yes, I have.

256
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:35,854
不过恐怕没有太大的帮助
But I'm afraid it doesn't help very much.

257
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,512
你弟弟的确是搭上了我们去罗马的航班
Your brother definitely did get on our flight to Rome,

258
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,200
但他下飞机之后做了什么，我就没法告诉你了
but what he did when he got off the plane,
I couldn't tell you.

259
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,696
啊，如果你不能，谁能？
Well, if you can't, who can?

260
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,040
Briggs 小姐，我们每周都要跟上千乘客打交道
Miss Briggs, We're dealing with
thousands of passengers every week.

261
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,136
我们不可能跟踪每一个人的行踪
We can't keep track of every single one.

262
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:51,136
如果我是你，就会回到利物浦去
If I were you, I'd go back to Liverpool.

263
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:53,744
我确信你弟弟最终会露面的
I'm sure your brother will turn up eventually.

264
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,704
现在，什么别的事情的话，我得关闭柜台了
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to close this kiosk.

265
00:17:57,888 --> 00:17:59,136
谢谢你什么事都没干
Thanks for nothing.

266
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,480
- 这事还真是有意思  - 为什么？
- There's something funny going on here.   - Why?

267
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,104
我弟弟不见了，而那家伙完全漠不关心
My brother's vanished, and that lot just couldn't care less.

268
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:56,336
你好，这个机场的总负责人叫什么？
Hello? What's the name of the man
who's in charge of this airport?

269
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,240
总指挥？
The Commandant?

270
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,784
好，你能帮我接到他的办公室吗，拜托？
Right, well look, can you put me
through to his office, please?

271
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:04,192
好了，那接航空控制塔台
All right, then Air Traffic Control

272
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:05,616
但我想跟我的一个朋友通话
but I want to speak to a friend of mine //

273
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:07,616
他现在应该跟总指挥在一起
who should be with the Commandant right now.

274
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,840
博士，我期望你见见这位年轻女士
Doctor, I'd like you to meet this young lady.

275
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,900
什么年轻女士？Polly 在哪儿？
What young lady? Where's Polly?

276
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,540
她还在里面
She's still inside.

277
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,440
啊，我一分钟就回来
Ah, I shan't be a minute.

278
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,540
Polly...​
Polly...

279
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,360
但你为什么不听他的？都是真的
But why wouldn't you listen to him? It's all true.

280
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:55,744
我现在在变色龙机库，而我刚刚发...
I'm in the Chameleon Hangar now and I've just f...

281
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,080
Ben！
Ben!

282
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,576
Ben，你能听到我吗？
Ben, can you hear me?

283
00:20:01,904 --> 00:20:03,616
Ben，你能听到我吗？
Ben, can you hear me?

284
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,616
Ben，你没事吧，能听到我说话吗？Ben！
Ben, are you all right, can you hear me? Ben!

285
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:17,936
Ben！
Ben!

286
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:22,784
Ben，你能听到我吗？
Ben, can you hear me?

287
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,920
他是谁？
Who is he?

288
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:27,740

- What happened?  - Ah, it was all a hoax.

他已经走了10分钟了
