1
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:20,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,810
- 都搞定了  - 很好
- All set.   - Good.

3
00:00:52,672 --> 00:00:56,192
你不是想知道变色龙观光游的秘密吗？
You wanted to know the secret of Chameleon Tours. 

4
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,128
好了，督察...
Well Inspector,

5
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:04,960
你自己看！
see for yourself!

6
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,784
- 博士！  - 他死了！
- Doctor!   - He's dead!

7
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:23,440
你跟我来
You're coming with me.

8
00:01:23,504 --> 00:01:24,768
我不会离开他
I'll not leave him.

9
00:01:24,928 --> 00:01:26,944
你有五秒钟改变主义
You have five seconds to change your mind.

10
00:01:27,024 --> 00:01:28,416
除非你先杀了我
You'll have to kill me then.

11
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,416
我说了五秒
I said five seconds.

12
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,416
五，四，三...
Five, four, three...

13
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:35,760
SAMANTHA!​
SAMANTHA!

14
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,700
我想问这飞机往哪儿开，估计问也白问
I suppose there's no use my asking
where this plane's going to?

15
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,390
你很快就能知道了
You will know soon enough.

16
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,936
三号飞机呼叫基地
This is Plane Number Three to Base.

17
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,728
告诉总管我已经按他吩咐给他找了一个替身
Inform the Director that I have
an original for him as ordered.

18
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:53,767
正在运送过来
I am delivering him now,

19
00:02:54,096 --> 00:02:57,104
然后会立刻返回盖特威克机场
and will return immediately to Gatwick Airport.

20
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:01,264
Jamie？你没事吧
Jamie? Are you all right?

21
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:05,480
没事。他们..没有伤到你吧，有吗？
Aye. Th... They've not harmed you, have they?

22
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,310
没有，但我动不了
No - but I can't move.

23
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:12,000
博士？
Doctor?

24
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:13,888
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

25
00:03:13,952 --> 00:03:15,892
发生什么了？我...我动不了了
What's happening? I... I can't move.

26
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:18,112
那是什么？
What's that?

27
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:22,096
我...我不知道，是一束光
I... I don't know. It's a beam of light.

28
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,168
是。博士，它...在朝我们移动！
Aye. Doctor, it... it's moving towards us!

29
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:31,916
这对于将要发生在我们身上的事来说，只是一道小小的开胃菜
That's just a small fore-taste
of what'll happen to us //

30
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:33,616
要是我们还不赶紧挪开的话
if we don't move and quickly.

31
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,432
- 但我动不了，博士！  - 我也动不了
- But I can't move, Doctor!  - Neither can I.

32
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,288
等一下，我可以移动一只胳膊
Wait a minute. I can move one arm.

33
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:42,640
但我移动不了！
But I can't move away!

34
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,592
噢博士！你不能想什么办法停掉它吗？
Oh Doctor! Can't you do anything to stop it?

35
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,856
没办法
No.

36
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:14,480
等等，有一个
Wait. One thing.

37
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,008
虽然机会不大，但也许能成功
It's a long chance but it just might work. 

38
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,400
你包里有镜子吗?
Have you got a mirror in that bag?

39
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,368
- 有  - 我看看
- Yes.   - Let's see.

40
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:23,104
嗯，这应该可以。把它给我
Yes, that'll do. Hand it to me.

41
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:26,128
- 给不了  - 我没法移动我的手
- I can't.  - I can't move my hand.

42
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,470
Jamie，你能拿到吗？
Jamie, can you take it?

43
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:30,880
- 你拿到了吗？  - 还没，小心！
- Have you got it?   - No, careful!

44
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,784
- 接着！ - 接到了！
- Take it!   - Got it!

45
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,888
现在，看看你能否把它对准那个射线枪
Right now, see if you can point it at that laser gun.

46
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:39,584
- 墙上的那个东西 - 我试试，博士。不过为啥？
- That thing on the wall.  
- I'll try, Doctor. But why? 

47
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:42,816
如果你能把光反射回去，我们就有机会了
If you can reflect the light back,
we've got a chance.

48
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,256
你不能拿什么东西撑住它吗
Can't you prop it up on something?

49
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:47,896
不，不行...我，我用手拿着吧
No, it won't work.
I'll... I'll have to hold it.//

50
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:49,496
但是你...你的手！
But your...your hand!//

51
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,632
这个风险我不得不担
It's a risk I'll have to take.

52
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,650
快 Jamie！赶紧！
Quick Jamie! Now!

53
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:00,310
噢，干得好！
Oh, well done!

54
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:05,344
为什么...我动不了！
Why... I can move!

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,296
我...我觉得可能...
I... I wonder if...

56
00:05:07,552 --> 00:05:10,592
你觉得 Ben 和 Polly 是不是也遭遇了这个，博士？
Do you think that's what happened
to Ben and Polly, Doctor?

57
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:12,640
- 不是  - 你肯定吗？
- No.   - Are you sure?

58
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:15,180
我觉得他们拿他俩有别的用途
I think they were needed for some purpose.

59
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,688
- 而我们没有？  - 显然我们对他们太危险了
- And we weren't. 
- We were obviously too dangerous for them.

60
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,256
竟然想干这样的事情，在光天化日之下！
But to try and do something like this,
in broad daylight!

61
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,232
是啊。这只可能意味着一件事情，恐怕
Yes. That means only one thing, I'm afraid.

62
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,048
他们的计划快要完成了
Their plans are almost complete.

63
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,672
我们必须赶紧行动，否则别想就 Polly 和 Ben 了
We'll have to act fast
if we're going to save Polly and Ben.

64
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:33,240
还有 Brian，你是不是已经忘记他了
And Brian, or have you forgotten about him.

65
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,912
没，我没有忘记他，Sam
No, I've not forgotten him Sam,

66
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:37,170
但如果我的猜测没错的话，他们都在同一个地方
but if my guess is right,
they're all in the same place.

67
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,184
- 在什么地方？  - 我不知道
- And where's that?  - I don't know.

68
00:05:39,248 --> 00:05:42,320
等等！急救站！
Wait! The first aid post!

69
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:45,600
我们在那个监视器里面看到了一个急救站
We saw a first aid post on that monitor.

70
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,312
我们必须找到它
We must find it.

71
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:50,384
快点，你没打算在这里坐一整天吧，有吗？
Come on, you're not going to
sit there all day are you?

72
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,528
等一下，我们不能全都涌去急救站
Just a minute. We can't all
go down to the Medical Unit.

73
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,490
好吧，我能干点什么？
All right. What can I do?

74
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,592
那个想杀我们的男人，你有没有看清楚？
Did you get a good look
at the man who tried to kill us?

75
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,768
应该有吧，我都用脖子勒住他脖子了
I'll say. I had my arms around his neck.

76
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:03,760
去变色龙的柜台，看看能否看到他进出
Go down to the Chameleon Kiosk
and see if he comes in or out.

77
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,368
- 好  - 但是小心点，别让他看见你
- Right!
- But be careful. Don't let him see you.

78
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:10,912
我小心点？你俩自己小心点吧，我肯定没事
Me be careful!? You two watch out
for yourselves! I'll be OK!

79
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:14,912
她很有勇气，那个小姑娘，博士
She's got a lot of courage,
that wee lass, Doctor.

80
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:19,152
是，我只是期望她不要太冒险了
Yes. I just hope she doesn't
try to be too adventurous.

81
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,660
你是谁？
Who are you?

82
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,016
Steven Christopher Jenkins​
Steven Christopher Jenkins

83
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,248
你住在哪里？
Where do you live?

84
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,310
跟我父母一起住在温布尔顿
With my parents in Wimbledon.

85
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,240
职业呢？
Employment?

86
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:34,432
我是个移民局官员，在盖特威克机场工作
I'm an Immigration Officer, at Gatwick Airport.

87
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,984
过来，慢点。你很快就没事了
Come along, easy. You'll be all right.

88
00:06:37,984 --> 00:06:39,568
过来，慢点
Now come along, take it easy.

89
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,360
我们马上会让你安然无恙
We'll have you as right as rain in a minute.

90
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:44,208
现在在这里坐下FIXME，就这里
Now just get you down here. There we are.

91
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:47,328
- 很好  - 我怎么样，博士？
- Splendid.   - How am I doing, Doctor?

92
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:49,392
很好，但不要装过头了
Very well but don't over do it.

93
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:52,672
是了，就是这个房间。我们在监视器上看到的
Yes, this is the room.
We see... saw on the TV monitor.

94
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:58,224
如果这些药片没作用，再过来找我
If the tablets do not help, come and see me again.

95
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,920
- 他这是怎么了？  - 是一种罕见的热带疾病
- What's the matter with him?
- It's a rare tropical disease,

96
00:07:01,952 --> 00:07:02,990
护士，我是他的医生
Nurse. I'm his doctor.

97
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,252
如果他...他不能很快恢复，我们就...
If he... if he doesn't rally soon we shall err... //

98
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,152
我们就得给他用点梭玛林
we shall have to use somnalin.

99
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:11,600
- 梭玛林？  - 是的...对，梭玛林
- Somnalin?  - Yes... yes, somnalin

100
00:07:11,888 --> 00:07:15,680
所以我得找个地方让他躺下
So l have to get him somewhere to lie down.

101
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,096
哦对了，这里应该很合适
Oh yes, this will do nicely.  

102
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,096
恐怕..你不能进里面去
I... I'm afraid you can't go there.

103
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:21,580
为什么不能？这只是个X光室，是吧？
Why not? It's just an X-ray room, isn't it?//

104
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:23,580
屏风后面不是张躺椅吗？
Isn't that a couch behind the screen.

105
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,040
抱歉，医生，你不能把你的病人带进去
I'm sorry, Doctor.
You can't take your patient in there.

106
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,288
- 你拒绝给我的病患帮助？  - 不，不是这样的
- You refuse to help my patient?
- Oh, it's not that.

107
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:33,984
- 我有一个病人要来拍X光片  - 哦，我明白了
- I have someone coming for an X-ray.  - Oh I see.

108
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:36,430
那你怎么不一开始就告诉我呢？
Well why didn't you tell me in the first place.

109
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,344
来把你扶出去
<i>Let's get you out of here.</i>

110
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,920
这个博士对我们的计划是个威胁
That Doctor is a menace to our plans.

111
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,420
那我们必须杀了他
Then we must kill him.

112
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:51,680
我试过了，他肯定是又逃掉了
I tried. He must have escaped.

113
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:53,840
- 他们从我这里逃不了  - 不，等等
- They won't escape me.  - No, wait.

114
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:57,952
这一次，让他们来找我
This time, let them to come to us.

115
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,030
我一直在联系他，警司，但他一直没接
I've been paging him, Superintendent,
but he hasn't responded.

116
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:09,728
是，很好，先生。我会继续尝试
Yes, very well sir. I'll keep on trying.

117
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:16,528
接线员。我订了一个到雅典的电话，现在怎样了
Operator. Look, I booked a call through
to Athens, now what happened?

118
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,610
对，好吧。我在电话旁边等着
Yes, very well, I'll stay near the phone.

119
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:20,432
这都是怎么回事？
What's all this about?

120
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,064
- 噢博士，你见到 Crossland 督察了吗？  - 没有，怎么了？
- Oh Doctor, have you seen Inspector Crossland?
- Well no. Why?

121
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,320
哦，苏格兰场在找他，但我们在哪里都找不到
Well, Scotland Yard are looking for him
and we can't find him anywhere.

122
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:28,080
还有，Briggs 小姐想找你
Also, your Miss Briggs wants to see you.

123
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:30,848
但我跟她说了...她现在在哪儿？
But I told her to... Where is she now?

124
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,944
她说要去什么变色龙柜台
Well she said something about
going to the Chameleon Kiosk.

125
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,972
你去看看情况，Jamie
Go down and join her, Jamie. 

126
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,672
她这个年轻女人很有主见
She's a very strong headed young woman.

127
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,536
- 确保她不会碰到什么麻烦  - 我会看着她的，博士
- See she doesn't come to any trouble. 
- I'll keep an eye on her, Doctor.

128
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,320
总指挥，督察说过他要去哪儿了吗？
Commandant, did the Inspector say
where he was going?

129
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:52,528
唔，他说他要去找变色龙观光游问问情况
Hmm, oh he said he was going to
make some enquires about Chameleon Tours.

130
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,672
但他现在不见了？
And now he's disappeared?

131
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,904
- 你这结论下得也太快了吧？  - 我没觉得
- Aren't you rather jumping to conclusions?
- I don't think so.

132
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,160
我的两个朋友牵涉进变色龙观光游，他俩都不见了
My two friends became involved with Chameleon Tours, 
and they've both disappeared.

133
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,020
你知道我的猜测是什么
However, you know what I think has happened.

134
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:08,432
是的，你也知道我对你那荒谬的想法是怎么看的
Yes, and you know what I think
about your ridiculous theory.

135
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:11,024
外太空来的人，真的是
People from outer space, indeed.

136
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:13,232
你这是怎么了
Something the matter with you?

137
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,128
总指挥，我发现是怎么回事了
Commandant, I've found out what's been happening.

138
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,400
好，朝着正确的方向迈近了一步
Well, that's a step in the right direction.

139
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,136
我的意思是，我擅做主张，给所有机场打了电话
Wh... what I mean is, I took the liberty
of phoning all the airports

140
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:23,184
所以变色龙飞去的地方
that ah... err... Chameleon Tours fly to.

141
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:24,720
最后打的是雅典
The last on my list was Athens.

142
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:26,136
你就没意识到到雅典的电话费...
Don't you realise the expense of phoning Ath... 

143
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,136
是的我知道，我很抱歉
Yes, I know, I'm sorry.

144
00:09:27,216 --> 00:09:31,504
但是我发现了，他们从来没有运送任何乘客
But what I found out is -
they never deliver any passengers.

145
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:34,272
你说的什么意思？从来没有运送任何乘客？
What do you mean? Never deliver any passengers...

146
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,880
绝对是真的，先生。他们说的全都一样
It's absolutely true, sir.
They all say the same thing.

147
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,432
杜布罗夫尼克，雅典，罗马
Dubrovnik, Athens, Rome.

148
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,696
他们说年轻乘客搭上飞机去其它地方，但是...
They say they pick up young passengers 
to take them off to other places but...

149
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,570
没有一个人到达任何地方！
none of them ever arrive anywhere!

150
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,776
要是这样的话，他们肯定把这些人运到了某个秘密的机场
Well in that case, they must be flying
these young people to some secret airfield.

151
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:52,160
- 但是为什么呢？ - 你仍然还是地球人的思维
- But why?
- You're still thinking in Earth terms. 

152
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:54,160
我还就打算坚持这种思维
And I intend to go on doing so.

153
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,864
- 变色龙的飞行员是谁？  - Blade 机长
- What was the name of that Chameleon Pilot? 
- Captain Blade.

154
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:59,568
- 飞机预计什么时候回来  - 还有半个小时，先生
- And what time is the plane due back? 
- About half an hour, sir.

155
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:02,688
好，等这次掉头了，我们派人跟踪他们
Right. After the turn-round
we'll have it followed this time.

156
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:05,072
我能跟你说句话吗，亲爱的？
Could I have a word with you, my dear?

157
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,232
给我接皇家空军曼斯顿站
Get me the RAF Station Manston.

158
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:11,120
我怀疑急救中心跟这一切有联系
I suspect that the Medical Centre
is connected with all this.

159
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:14,144
- 急救中心..得了  - 请不要跟他一样
- Medical Cen... Oh come on...  
- Now please don't get like him.

160
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:16,172
是的，这里绝对有联系
Oh yes, there is definitely a connection,

161
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,730
现在，我打算进里面去，看一圈
now, I would like to get in there
and have a look round.

162
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:20,112
任何人都可以进去啊
But anyone can go in there.

163
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,056
但我期望能先把那个护士引开
But I would like to get that nurse
out of the way first...

164
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,840
你觉得你能帮我搞定吗？
Do you think that you can manage it for me?

165
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:29,872
你会发现这是没问题的
You'll find that in order.

166
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:32,592
他说你会做些傻事
He said you'd do something silly.

167
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:34,512
是吗？他还说什么了？
Oh yeah, what else did he say?

168
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,624
- 他说你很有主见  - 很好，你可以告诉博士
- He said you were headstrong.
- Oh great. Look, you can tell the Doctor

169
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:40,992
他不可能说服我放弃这个，你也不能
he's not going to talk me out of this one,
and neither are you.

170
00:10:41,152 --> 00:10:44,380
我要登上变色龙的下一次航班，还有半小时起飞
I'm going on the next Chameleon flight,
that leaves in half an hour.

171
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,072
你还没有明白吗，这是我们能查到线索的唯一途径
Oh look don't you see, it's the only way 
we can find out anything.

172
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,744
哦，别担心，我会回来告诉把全部经过都告诉你的
Oh, don't worry. I'll come back
and tell you all about it.

173
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,152
- 那你得回得来  - 哦，只是去一趟罗马罢了
- If you do come back. 
- Oh, it's only going to Rome.

174
00:10:57,264 --> 00:11:00,240
凭什么你确信你能在罗马找到你弟弟？
And what makes you so sure 
you'll find your brother in Rome?

175
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,320
哦，我不知道。但那是他本来应该抵达的地方
Oh, I don't know. But that's where
he was supposed to be going.

176
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,096
至少我可以做点什么
At least I'll be doing something. //


00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:08,496
是。但你没有意识到这有多危险
Aye, but do you not realise
how dangerous it is.

177
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:10,784
你可能是害怕了，我可没有
Look if you're scared, I'm certainly not.

178
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,024
- 要是博士在这里就好了  - 噢
- I wish the Doctor were here. 
- Oh.

179
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:15,510
嘿，也许我可以和你一起去
Hey, maybe I could go with you.

180
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,688
嘿，这还差不多。
Hey, now you're talking.

181
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,288
你觉得你买得机票吗？
Do you think you can you raise the lolly?

182
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:20,864
- 机票？  - 费用，钱
- The lolly?  - The brass, the money.

183
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:23,968
会花费你28块钱，或者说英镑
Look it will cost you twenty-eight
quid - pounds to you.

184
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,904
哦，那是好大一笔钱。我从来没有这么多钱
Oh but that's a fortune.
I've never seen that much money in my life. 

185
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:32,448
- 我估计..我不能可以替你去吗？ - 不行
- I suppose I... I couldn't take your place?
- No!

186
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:39,424
博士说这可不是一个小姑娘能干的事情
The Doctor said it was er...
no job for a wee lassie...

187
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:43,104
- 一个小姑娘！你可以告诉博士... - 说再见吧
- A wee lassie! You can tell the Doctor... 
- I say goodbye.

188
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:49,648
嘿，小子！我可以照顾好自己，知道吧
Hey, kid! I can take care of myself, you know.

189
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,616
我只是不太放心
I just wanted to make sure.

190
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,627
唔，所以你可以安排人跟踪？
Hmm. So you can arrange to have it followed?

191
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:57,528
好，我会搞明白的
Good. Oh I'll find out.//

192
00:11:57,664 --> 00:12:00,128
变色龙的下一趟航班什么时候？
What time's the next Chameleon flight?

193
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,616
15:30飞罗马，先生
1530hrs to Rome, sir.

194
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,096
15:30 往南飞
1530hrs heading South.

195
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:07,776
好，等他们请求起飞的时候我会通知你
Right. And I'll let you know
when they request permission to start up.

196
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,190
再见老伙计，很是感谢
Cheerio old man and many thanks.

197
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,816
好了，都安排妥了
Well, that's settled that.

198
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:16,000
变色龙的下一趟航班就会有皇家空军跟在它后面了
The next Chameleon flight
will have an RAF fighter on its tail.

199
00:12:17,616 --> 00:12:22,896
老天，Jean，Jean！
Good grief. Jean. Jean!

200
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,048
这姑娘怎么了？找急救中心
What's the matter with the girl?
Get me the Medical Centre.

201
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,360
你的助手不能自己到这里来吗，总指挥？
Isn't it possible for your assistant
to come down here, Commandant.

202
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,216
但我不能离开这里啊
But I'm not supposed to leave here.

203
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,968
好吧，先生，既然你坚持的话
All right sir, if you insist.

204
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:38,864
我要下班了
I'm just going off duty, 

205
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,590
但这位先生会很高兴继续照顾你
but err this gentleman
will be pleased to attend to you.

206
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,440
- 你现在觉得怎样  - 不太好
- How do you feel now?  - Not too good.

207
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:52,780
我就不明白了，她从来没有这样过
I can't understand it. 
She's never done this on me before.

208
00:13:57,216 --> 00:13:59,328
谢谢你护士，我现在觉得好多了
Thank you Nurse. I feel much better now.

209
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,216
那就应该没有什么大事
Well there couldn't be much wrong then.

210
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:02,528
你吃过午饭了吗？
Have you had any lunch?

211
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,328
没，我今天一直很忙，连早饭都还没有吃
No I've been so busy today,
I haven't even had any breakfast.

212
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:07,578
那怪不得你会不舒服了
Then no wonder you didn't feel well.

213
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,200
真的总指挥，你必须得让你的下属有时间按时吃饭
Really Commandant. You must see that 
your staff have time for regular meals.

214
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:14,800
我从没阻止过她吃午饭！
I've never stopped her having her lunch!

215
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,656
我确信，总指挥，但这种事总还是会发生
I'm sure, Commandant. 
But it has been known to happen.

216
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:23,040
- 来看看这儿  - 做得很好！
- Now look here.   - Very well done!

217
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,960
- 我有没有给你足够时间  - 很多时间
- Did I give you enough time? - Ample time.

218
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,488
这都是怎么回事？你完全就没病，对不？
What is all this?
You weren't ill at all, were you?

219
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:30,400
没事了，总指挥，她是按我的指示在演戏
It's all right, Commandant. 
She was acting on my instructions.

220
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,544
- 按你的指示？ - 是。你对这些东西怎么看
- On your instructions?
- Yes. What do you think of these?

221
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,080
这些是什么？
Now, what are these?

222
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,624
我猜这里有人能告诉我们
I think there's somebody here who can tell us.

223
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,430
打扰了
Excuse me.

224
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,000
一直坐在这里的那个家伙哪里去了？
Where's the chap who usually sits there?

225
00:14:50,128 --> 00:14:51,568
哦他很可能是下班了
Well he's probably off duty.

226
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:54,352
如果是这样的话，他应该过几个小时就会回来上班了
In that case, he'll be back on shift
in a couple of hours.

227
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,808
我知道了。好吧，看来得等了
I see. Oh well, these'll have to wait.

228
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,346
变色龙青年观光游通知您//
Chameleon Youth Tours announce the departure

229
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,920
飞往罗马的419航班即将起飞
of their flight number Four-One-Nine to Rome.

230
00:15:05,232 --> 00:15:08,320
请所有旅客在候机室集合
Will all passengers please
assemble in the departure lounge.

231
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,016
不要忘了您的明信片
Don't forget your postcards. 

232
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:14,270
把它们交给我，我们将会帮你们寄出去...
Give them back to me
and we'll post them for you when...

233
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:17,430
你找到你的机票了吗？
Have you found your ticket yet?

234
00:15:17,504 --> 00:15:19,568
我不知道，好像是在某个地方弄丢了
I don't know. I seem to have lost it somewhere.

235
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,680
但你认得我的，对吧，我从你这里买的票
But you remember me, don't you?
I bought it off you.

236
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,900
又太多人了...名字是什么？
There are so many people...
what was the name?

237
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:26,248
呃，Samantha Briggs
Err, Samantha Briggs.//

238
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:27,648
噢，机票上写的是 S. Briggs
Oh, it had S. Briggs on the ticket.

239
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:29,600
S. Briggs has already checked in.
S. Briggs 已经检票进去了

240
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,016
哦不。到底是谁...
Oh no. Well, who the heck...

241
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,640
你记得那姑娘长什么样吗？
Look, can you remember what she looked like?

242
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:36,560
姑娘？我好像记得拿票的是个小伙子
She? I seem to remember a boy with that ticket.

243
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:39,792
Jamie! 他偷走了票。我说，你们必须要拦住他！
Jamie! He's pinched it.
Look you have to stop him!

244
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,540
我没法拦住飞机
I can't hold up the flight.

245
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:42,530
但是听着...
But look...

246
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:45,130
我很抱歉，我帮不了你什么了
I'm sorry, there's nothing more
I can do for you.

247
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:47,936
你好
Hello.

248
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:52,160
好了，没事了，你真是太好了
Yes, all right. That's very kind of you.

249
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:56,256
你很幸运，你的票找到了
You're very fortunate. 
Your ticket's just been found.

250
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,872
- 噢好，谁捡到了？ - 恐怕我们不能告诉你
- Oh good. Well who got it?
- We can't tell you that I'm afraid.

251
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:02,560
但我们经理想要见你，那就在那边
but our manager would like to see you.
He's just through there.

252
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,180
好，拜
Oh right, ta.

253
00:16:05,776 --> 00:16:08,896
现在，谁把明信片准备好了？
Now, who's got their postcards ready?

254
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,616
- 呃，是你想见我？ - 对，真的
- Er, you wanted to see me?  - Yes, indeed. 

255
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,896
你再也逃不了了！
You won't escape again!

256
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,960
变色龙419，准许出港
Chameleon Four-One-Nine. Clearance correct.

257
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,980
变色龙419，准许滑行
Chameleon Four-One-Nine. Taxi Clearance?

258
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,872
变色龙419，沿南滑行道滑行，
Chameleon Four-One-Nine.
Taxi following southern taxiway

259
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:35,472
- 准备离开27号跑道  - 收到
- for departure runway two-seven. - Roger.

260
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:38,304
这一次他们就有皇家空军跟在屁股后面了！
Well this time they'll have the RAF on their tail!

261
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:41,456
现在这些战斗机可以到达多高，总指挥？
How high can fighters go these days, Commandant?

262
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,560
- 哦，十英里以上  - 好逊
- Oh, ten miles plus. - How futile.

263
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,160
- 曼斯顿皇家空军基地，先生  - 哦好
- RAF Manston, sir.  - Oh, good.

264
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:56,848
你好，老小子。变色龙的罗马航班刚刚起飞
Hello, old boy.
The Chameleon Rome flight's just taken off.

265
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,096
他们在琥珀一号上，飞行高度210
They're on Amber One,
at flight level two-one-zero.

266
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:04,970
好，祝好
Right. Good man.

267
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:08,400
你们可以解开安全带了，谢谢
You can unfasten your seat belts now. Thank you.

268
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:09,696
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

269
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,480
- 啊，我会没事的  - 好
- Oh aye, I'll be all right. - Good.

270
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,200
他们正要跨越50英里的标记点
That's the fifty-mile mark they're passing now.

271
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,472
通常你们在这个距离看不到他们吧
Normally you don't plot them at this range?

272
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,024
看不到，有太多飞机需要控制了
No, there's too much traffic to control.

273
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:32,080
一旦他们起飞，进入空中走廊，就跟我们没关系了
Once they're up and away on their air corridor,
we're finished with them.

274
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,752
你好，盖特威克机场。这里是皇家空军241
Hello, Gatwick Airport. This is RAF Two-Four-One.//

275
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,752
你们可以听到吗？
How do you read me?

276
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,672
盖特威克机场呼叫RAF-241，我们可以清晰地听到
Gatwick Airport to RAF Two-Four-One.
We read you loud and clear.

277
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:42,624
变色龙的飞机正在视野内
Have the Chameleon aircraft in sight.

278
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:45,376
正在一万英尺高度尾随，朝南飞行
Am following at ten thousand feet, heading due south.

279
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,064
就是他，咬住尾巴。目前看来进展不错！
That's him. Right on the tail. So far so good!

280
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,400
都搞定了
All set.

281
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,960
有什么东西在跟着我们
Something's following us.

282
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,520
有另外一家飞机走同一路线？
Another airliner going the same way?

283
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,780
不，太小了
No, it's too small.

284
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:12,320
是架战斗机。给我雷达数据
It's a fighter. Give me a radar reading.

285
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:15,744
方位23-79​
Two-three decimal seven-nine.

286
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:27,392
Heslington, 战斗机偏离航线了！
Heslington, that fighter's off course!

287
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,780
盖特威克机场呼叫RAF-241，你可以听到吗？
Gatwick to RAF Two-Four-One. Do you read me?

288
00:18:31,616 --> 00:18:33,456
那飞机可不是简单地偏离航线
That plane isn't just off course.

289
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:35,600
- 有事情发生了  - 你说得对，它失控了
- Something's happened to it.  
- You're right. It's out of control. 

290
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,864
盖特威克机场呼叫RAF-241，你可以听到吗？
Gatwick to RAF Two-Four-One. Do you read me?

291
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:40,930
我觉得你收不到回答了
I don't think you'll get a reply. //

292
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:42,830
信号变弱了，已经要从雷达上消失了
It's fading, dropping out of our radar.

293
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,560
Jean，给我接皇家空军，那家飞机坠毁了
Jean, get me RAF Manston. That plane's crashed.

294
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:49,136
看变色龙的飞机！肯定也出什么事了
Look at the Chameleon plane! 
There's something wrong with that too.

295
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:49,776
唔
Hmmm?

296
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:51,696
它停止不动了！不可能啊
It's standing still! Impossible.

297
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,392
不，先生，光点是静止的
No sir, the blip's stationary.

298
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,152
这只意味着一件事情
That can only mean one thing...

299
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:58,390
它也坠毁了！
It's crashing too!

300
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,560
立即向飞行甲板汇报
Report to the flight deck immediately.

301
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,112
下一航班有多少人需要护照才能离开机场？
How many people require passports 
in order to leave the airport on the next flight?

302
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,912
- 25个  - 这里你漏了一个
- Twenty-Five.  - You missed this one here.

303
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:32,864
对不起
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,200
继续吧
Carry on.

305
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,290
海上救援队报告说没有找到，先生
Negative report from Air Sea Rescue, sir.

306
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,696
但有两架飞机掉了，肯定会有残骸的痕迹啊
But with two aircraft ditching
there must be some signs of wreckage.

307
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:54,730
你为什么觉得变色龙的飞机是坠落到海里了？
Why do you think the Chameleon plane
crashed into the sea?

308
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,264
因为它从我们的雷达屏幕上消失了！
Because it disappeared off our radar screen!

309
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:58,576
但它一开始是静止没动！
But it stood still first!

310
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:01,616
因为它肯定是跟空军的飞机撞上了，然后掉落下去
Because it must have collided with
the RAF plane and dropped like a stone.

311
00:20:01,872 --> 00:20:03,488
你为什么会这么想
Why do you think that?

312
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,664
要知道，当一架飞机像那样在雷达上静止不动
You see, when a plane on that radar
appears to stand still,

313
00:20:07,712 --> 00:20:10,352
那么它事实上就是直线下落了
it is in point of fact dropping straight down.

314
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,832
- 直线上升怎么样？  - 噢，我亲爱的博士
- What about straight up?
- Oh my dear Doctor!

315
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,712
要能像那样跑出我们雷达的范围
To get above our radar umbrella like that

316
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:19,568
它必须垂直爬上达到100英里高
it'd have to climb vertically
until it was a hundred miles high.

317
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,224
那该死的高度就是外太空了
The darned thing would be in outer space.

318
00:20:22,464 --> 00:20:23,664
正是这个！
Exactly!
