1
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:16,479
It's a flying beastie!

2
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:39,805
Hey, you! Stop!

3
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,360
Scatter!

4
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:52,926
- The pilot said what?
- A police box on the runway.

5
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:58,207
A likely story! Tell him to get back into stack
and await further instructions.

6
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:01,120
Miss Rock, get the airport police.

7
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:04,165
Control. Sugar Delta X-ray.

8
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:05,999
Return to stack.

9
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:08,158
Police? Commandant here.

10
00:03:08,327 --> 00:03:12,445
Reports of obstruction
on intersection of runways five and two.

11
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:15,280
Investigate and report back.

12
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:17,119
Police box

13
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:08,044
Jamie! Come over here with me.

14
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:11,998
Come on.

15
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:37,038
Just a minute.

16
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:40,125
Give me that envelope!

17
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:43,122
I would advise you to stop.

18
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:47,639
Agh!

19
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:32,762
Can you come quickly? Trouble.

20
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:34,918
<i>Trouble? What happened?</i>

21
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:37,555
The postcards. Someone found them.

22
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:39,285
<i>Right.</i>

23
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:42,722
All right. So you dumped it
by number four hangar, but what was it?

24
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:45,843
It WAS a police box?

25
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:49,362
Get me the police chief.

26
00:06:49,527 --> 00:06:54,681
All right. You can bring those planes down now.
The obstruction's been cleared.

27
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:58,356
Do you think it was a practical joke?

28
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:02,725
- Students or someone?
- They'll pay for it when I get my hands on them.

29
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:06,084
I won't have passengers' lives
endangered by anyone.

30
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:10,126
Superintendent Reynolds?
I have the commandant for you.

31
00:07:10,287 --> 00:07:14,565
What's all this about a police box on the runway?

32
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:21,081
Oh... Well, security's
got to be tightened up all round!

33
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:24,045
Four suspects were seen running away from it.

34
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:25,845
- Did they catch them?
- No!

35
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:29,443
Idiot of a policeman lost them.
They're miles away by now.

36
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:34,038
Get me Immigration.

37
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:38,758
Tell them to let me know
if any suspicious characters are seen there.

38
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,284
- There's Polly!
- Polly! Over here!

39
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:54,638
Doctor...

40
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,082
I've just seen a man killed!

41
00:07:57,247 --> 00:07:59,522
- Hit by one of the beasties?
- No.

42
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:13,402
There were two men in there. One of them
had a gun, and he shot the other one.

43
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:18,641
- The murderer - did he see you?
- He chased me but I managed to lose him.

44
00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:21,162
Could you find this hangar again?

45
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:24,000
Well, I think so...

46
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:28,285
I can remember the name.
It was Chameleon something or other.

47
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:32,842
- Where's Ben?
- We haven't seen him. Let's find this hangar.

48
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:37,239
- The bloke with the gun will be looking for me.
- We'll look after you.

49
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:40,160
- What about Ben?
- We'll find him. Come on.

50
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,724
- He found the postcards.
- His name?

51
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:58,756
I don't know. I caught him in the office.
He'd found evidence. I had to stop him.

52
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:10,806
You've killed Detective Inspector Gascoigne -
a policeman.

53
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:15,800
- Do you think a parent sent him?
- Possibly. It doesn't matter.

54
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:20,916
The important thing is
that nobody should find him. Arrange disposal.

55
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:34,598
All right. Get it over here as quickly as possible.

56
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:40,917
- A container is on the way.
- Right.

57
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:43,078
Destroy this.

58
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:45,715
Why have you left those suitcases there?

59
00:09:45,887 --> 00:09:48,321
The detective - he interrupted me.

60
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:07,925
Spencer!

61
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:10,078
<i>Look.</i>

62
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:13,316
<i>The bloke came out of that door there.</i>

63
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,160
<i>Is it locked? Is anyone in there?</i>

64
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,847
<i>It's locked. There's nobody there.</i>

65
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:31,199
This man who killed him.

66
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:36,157
- Would you recognise him again?
- He chased me. I'd recognise him anywhere.

67
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:38,884
Fool!

68
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:45,678
Polly, how would you say he was killed?

69
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:47,678
With a gun.

70
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,838
Can you describe it to me?

71
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:52,922
No. It was too far away. Why?

72
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:55,237
This man was electrocuted.

73
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:58,918
His clothes are all scorched.

74
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:02,238
It was definitely some kind of a gun, Doctor.

75
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:07,365
Maybe. But not one
that's been developed yet on this planet.

76
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:11,676
This man they call Doctor,
where does he get his knowledge?

77
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:13,838
He looks like a normal being.

78
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:18,319
More intelligent than most.
He's a threat to our operation.

79
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:22,765
- I'll kill him.
- No. Get the girl. She can identify you.

80
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:26,237
- We can deal with the man later.
- He may talk.

81
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:28,079
So?

82
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:30,238
Nobody will believe him.

83
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:36,086
- We must report this.
- That man who chased us. We could find him.

84
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:40,240
The policeman? No, we must find
the man in charge in this place.

85
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,637
We can't just leave him here.

86
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:47,198
There's nothing else we can do.
Let's find the main airport building.

87
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:54,566
- Is this is the right way?
- It seems to lead to the main building.

88
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:13,079
- What happened to me?
- A temporary disablement.

89
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:16,159
You'll be back to normal any second now.
Up here.

90
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:19,886
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.

91
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:29,321
- I've got her.
- Excellent. Did anybody see you this time?

92
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:33,685
- Her friends didn't notice anything.
- They'll come looking for me.

93
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:35,485
Sit down.

94
00:12:37,287 --> 00:12:39,278
Murderers!

95
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:43,520
You'll have to show us some respect
and answer my questions.

96
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:47,839
- Which airline do you work for?
- I don't understand.

97
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:52,637
You must belong to an airline
or the airport authority to be in this area.

98
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:57,437
I've got nothing to do with the airport.
We'd just arrived. We were lost.

99
00:12:57,607 --> 00:13:02,601
I was trying to find someone to help me,
and I saw him kill a man.

100
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,564
How did you get here?

101
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:09,847
We'll gain nothing by questioning her.
The important thing is that we've got her.

102
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:14,159
You don't think my friends
are just going to forget me, do you?

103
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:21,003
<i>Polly's nowhere to be seen.
Something must have happened to her.</i>

104
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,716
<i>That's locked, Jamie.
There's nobody there.</i>

105
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:32,799
We're wasting our time here. The sooner
we tell the authorities, the better. Come on.

106
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:37,959
You're right. Your friends ARE worried about you.

107
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:42,882
Then we shall have to do something
to stop them worrying.

108
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,078
This seems to be the way, Jamie.

109
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:05,597
Excuse me... We're looking
for someone in authority.

110
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:08,361
Just a moment, sir. All in good time.

111
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:10,518
Thank you, madam.

112
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,837
Now, sir. Your passport, please.

113
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:17,717
- We want to see someone in authority.
- I am in authority. Passport, please.

114
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:20,401
We have something important to report.

115
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:24,082
Yes, sir, when you've found your passport.
Next, please.

116
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:27,478
- What's a passport?
- Official mumbo-jumbo. Look!

117
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:31,162
We've just discovered a dead body out there.

118
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:35,246
Did you hear me?

119
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:40,083
- If I were you, I'd inform the police.
- Please tell me where we can find them.

120
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:43,080
- In the main concourse.
- And where is that?

121
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:47,479
- Through this door and turn to your left.
- Thank you very much.

122
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:49,763
May I see your passport, sir?

123
00:14:49,927 --> 00:14:53,806
We neither of us have passports!
Does that satisfy you?

124
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:58,324
You couldn't have
got on the aircraft without passports.

125
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:01,684
- What aircraft?
- The one you arrived on, sir.

126
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:05,920
- We didn't arrive on an aircraft.
- This joke's gone far enough.

127
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:10,877
You must have arrived on the last inbound flight -
flight 729 from Madrid.

128
00:15:11,047 --> 00:15:12,799
Tell him about the Tardis!

129
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:15,481
- What's that?
- It's the way we got here.

130
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:19,686
- Do you know anything about a police box?
- That's what I'm saying!

131
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:22,281
Our mode of conveyance is irrelevant.

132
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:27,237
We found a dead body out there
and we want to report it to someone in authority!

133
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:32,197
You'll have plenty of opportunity
to see someone in authority. Take a seat.

134
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:36,758
Thank you very much.

135
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:38,997
Give me the commandant, please.

136
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:45,437
Hello, sir. Jenkins here. Immigration desk five.
I've got two of your suspects here.

137
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:17,078
Anyone here?

138
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:20,637
There must be someone around. Anyone here?

139
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:27,400
- Hello. Is Captain Blade about?
- I don't know. I'm a bit lost.

140
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:31,480
- Are you looking for me?
- Yes, I have your flight schedules.

141
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:34,115
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

142
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:38,680
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for the way out.

143
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:44,240
This is private property. Visitors are not welcome.
Do you belong to the airport staff?

144
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:48,241
Yeah. I started today.
I didn't mean to come in here. I got lost.

145
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:52,241
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am.

146
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:55,641
Are you going to direct me or not?

147
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:00,365
Yes, of course. Come on.
I'll show you the way.

148
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:05,325
- You say this girl witnessed a murder?
- Yes. She saw the man killed!

149
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:07,955
He was electrocuted with a ray gun.

150
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,244
- A what?
- The point is that he was killed

151
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:14,604
- and my friend saw it happen.
- Where is she?

152
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,325
She's vanished.

153
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:19,957
People who vanish, ray guns...
Is this some sort of joke?

154
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,119
You wouldn't think it a joke if you saw the body.

155
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:25,278
What flight did they come in on?

156
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:31,397
They came in with the passengers from
flight 729 from Madrid, but they've no passports.

157
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:35,876
Perhaps you'd kindly explain
why you have no passports.

158
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:37,799
We're all wasting time!

159
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:43,041
Are you going to come and see that body,
or shall I find someone who really is in charge?

160
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:48,122
I am in charge, thank you. Now,
both accompany me to this hangar immediately.

161
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,802
Thank you very much. At last!

162
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:56,677
- Tell Air Traffic Control where I am.
- Yes, sir.

163
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,476
Immigration desk five here.

164
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:06,038
Number One's just gone to the hangar area.
He asked me to let you know.

165
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:11,156
He's just gone to look for a dead body
It's going to be one of those days, isn't it?

166
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:31,117
- Get her?
- She's being processed.

167
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:33,847
They can take another on the next flight.

168
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:36,237
Excellent.

169
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,399
The body - it's gone!

170
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:10,004
- Are you sure you've got the right hangar?
- Aye. The name's up outside.

171
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,442
The body was lying just here.

172
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:16,639
Well, let's see what we HAVE got, shall we?

173
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:25,596
- What exactly are you doing?
- For the police, of course.

174
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:29,601
- I can't tell them who he was.
- A mystery man, no doubt.

175
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:32,725
There was nothing
in his pockets to identify him.

176
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:37,563
- A man with nothing in his pockets
- Yes, I was rather surprised myself.

177
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:41,561
- Wait. There WAS one thing.
- What did he have in his pocket?

178
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:43,604
This.

179
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:47,555
- A postage stamp
- But it's Spanish and it hasn't been used.

180
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:53,085
- I'm sure that'll make all the difference
- Exactly. Hello... This is interesting.

181
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:54,726
What have you found now?

182
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:57,484
It's burnt fibres.

183
00:19:57,647 --> 00:20:01,959
What about this, Doctor?
This wasn't here before. It's a burn mark.

184
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:07,679
You're right. It's quite new. It's good
to see someone is using their intelligence.

185
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:10,407
I've had enough! You're coming with me.

186
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:15,357
- That was made by a ray gun.
- Ray gun, burnt fibres, foreign stamps...

187
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:18,917
- Unused foreign stamps.
- I must be as mad as you are

188
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:20,884
even to be listening to you!

189
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:23,800
You know what they've done with the body?

190
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:29,325
- Somewhere there's a large packing case.
- Right behind you, Doctor!

191
00:20:33,287 --> 00:20:36,962
- Can I help you?
- Are you connected with Chameleon Tours?

192
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:39,516
Yes. I'm Captain Blade - chief pilot.

193
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:43,441
These gentlemen think
there's an incident happened in here.

194
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:47,236
- An incident?
- Could we look in this packing case?

195
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:50,285
- May I ask who you are?
- I'm the commandant.

196
00:20:50,927 --> 00:20:52,918
Yes, of course.

197
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,078
What do you expect to find?

198
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:58,761
A dead man.

199
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:01,441
How very interesting.

200
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:14,518
Plastic cups! Now I'm going to do
some investigating of my own.

201
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:19,602
- I'm glad I've roused your interest!
- You have. I'm going to investigate you

202
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:22,281
and why you're both here in the airport.

203
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,519
- Come on, you two. Out.
- We'd better humour him.

204
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:38,598
Bring him down.

205
00:21:44,647 --> 00:21:46,638
It's all right.

206
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:53,921
Will he survive?
If we hurry.

207
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:58,002
There you are.

208
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:03,241
We've got to get you to the airport building
and you'll be safe.

209
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:08,246
He's reaching suffocation point. Hurry.

210
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:13,322
- You didn't let me search properly.
- That hangar is leased to a private company.

211
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:17,878
We have no right to search in there.
Now, will you sit down and keep quiet?

212
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:23,804
Get onto Superintendent Reynolds.
This is his job. These people are trespassing.

213
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,721
- We've another flight coming through.
- All right. I'll do it.

214
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:29,559
Doctor, look!

215
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:59,921
- This is the girl I was telling you about.
- I beg your pardon?

216
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,681
Do you know these gentlemen?

217
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:06,760
- No. Why? Should I?
- According to them, they know you.

218
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,725
- Where have you been, Polly?
- Polly?

219
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:12,959
My name isn't Polly.
You must have made a mistake.

220
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:15,800
I've never seen them before in my life.
