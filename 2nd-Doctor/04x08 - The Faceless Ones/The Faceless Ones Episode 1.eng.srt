1
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,380
It's a flying beastie!

2
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,320
Hey, you! Stop!

3
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,240
Scatter!

4
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,640
- The pilot said what?
- A police box on the runway.

5
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,765
A likely story! Tell him to get back into stack

6
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
and await further instructions.

7
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,720
Miss Rock, get the airport police.

8
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,760
Control. Sugar Delta X-ray.

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,590
Return to stack.

10
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,750
Police? Commandant here.

11
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:56,950
In-bound aircraft reports obstruction

12
00:01:57,024 --> 00:01:59,600
on intersection of runways five and two.

13
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:01,616
Investigate and report back.

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,710
Police box

15
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,980
Jamie! Come over here with me.

16
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,840
Come on.

17
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,840
Just a minute.

18
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,920
Give me that envelope!

19
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,520
I would advise you to stop.

20
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,030
Agh!

21
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,160
Can you come quickly? Trouble.

22
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,310
<i>Trouble? What happened?</i>

23
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,950
The postcards. Someone found them.

24
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,680
<i>Right.</i>

25
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:22,736
All right, all right.

26
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,144
So you dumped it by number four hangar, but what was it?

27
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,184
It WAS a police box?

28
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,760
Get me the police chief.

29
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
All right. You can bring those planes down now.

30
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,760
- The obstruction's been cleared.
- Right, sir.

31
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,940
Do you think it was a practical joke, sir? Students or someone?

32
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,120
Well, whoever it was, they'll pay for it when I get my hands on them.

33
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,800
I won't have passengers' lives
endangered by practical jokers or anyone else.

34
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,500
Superintendent Reynolds?
I have the commandant for you.

35
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,820
The Chief of Police.

36
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,620
Listen, what's all this about a police box on the runway?

37
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,480
Oh... Well, security's
got to be tightened up all round!

38
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,440
He reports that four suspects were seen running away from it.

39
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,920
- Did they catch them?
- No!

40
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,840
Idiot of a policeman lost them.
They're miles away by now.

41
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,430
Get me Immigration.

42
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:22,150
Tell them to let me know
if any suspicious characters are seen there.

43
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,680
- There's Polly!
- Polly! Over here!

44
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,030
Doctor...

45
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,480
I've just seen a man killed!

46
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,920
- Hit by one of the beasties?
- No.

47
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,300
There were two men in there.

48
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,800
One of them had a gun,
and he shot the other one.

49
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,540
The murderer,  did he see you?

50
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,040
He chased me but I managed to lose him.

51
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,560
Could you find this hangar again?

52
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,400
Well, I think so...

53
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,680
I can remember the name.
It was Chameleon something or other.

54
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,240
- Where's Ben?
- We haven't seen him. Let's find this hangar.

55
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,840
The bloke with the gun will be looking for me.

56
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,280
We'll look after you. Now, come on.

57
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,460
- What about Ben?
- We'll find him. Come on.

58
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,120
- He found the postcards.
- His name?

59
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,620
I don't know. I caught him in the office.

60
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,660
He'd found evidence. I had to stop him.

61
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,200
You've killed Detective Inspector Gascoigne -
a policeman.

62
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,191
Do you think a parent sent him?

63
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:59,200
Possibly. It doesn't matter.

64
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,020
The important thing is
that nobody should find him.

65
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,940
Arrange disposal.

66
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,990
All right. Get it over here as quickly as possible.

67
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,310
- A container is on the way.
- Right.

68
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,470
Destroy this.

69
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,110
Why have you left those suitcases there?

70
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,720
The detective - he interrupted me.

71
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,320
Spencer!

72
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,470
<i>Look.</i>

73
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,710
<i>The bloke came out of that door there.</i>

74
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,560
<i>Is it locked? Is anyone in there?</i>

75
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,240
<i>It's locked. There's nobody there.</i>

76
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,590
This man who killed him.

77
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,500
Would you recognise him again?

78
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,550
Yes! He chased me. I'd recognise him anywhere.

79
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,280
Fool!

80
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,440
Polly, how would you say he was killed?

81
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,470
With a gun.

82
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,630
Can you describe it to me?

83
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,980
No. It was too far away. Why?

84
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,030
This man was electrocuted.

85
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,710
His clothes are all scorched.

86
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,030
It was definitely some kind of a gun, Doctor.

87
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,160
Maybe. But not one
that's been developed yet on this planet.

88
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,470
This man they call Doctor,
where does he get his knowledge?

89
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,630
He looks like a normal being.

90
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,110
More intelligent than most.
He's a threat to our operation.

91
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,560
- I'll kill him.
- No. Get the girl. She can identify you.

92
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,030
- We can deal with the man later.
- He may talk.

93
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,870
So?

94
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,030
Nobody will believe him.

95
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,847
We must report this to the authorities.

96
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,880
That man who chased us. We could find him maybe.

97
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,080
The policeman?

98
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,040
No, no, Jamie, we must find
the man in charge in this place.

99
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,730
What about him? We can't just leave him here.

100
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,213
There's nothing else we can do.

101
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:27,240
Now let's find the main airport building. Come on.

102
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,540
Are you sure this is the right way, Doctor?

103
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,660
It seems to lead to the main airport building.

104
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,300
- What happened to me?
- A temporary disablement.

105
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,220
You'll be back to normal any second now.
Up here.

106
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,980
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.

107
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,420
- I've got her.
- Excellent. Did anybody see you this time?

108
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,953
She was following behind her friends, but they didn't notice.

109
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:16,580
- They'll come looking for me.
- Sit down.

110
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,370
Murderers!

111
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,620
You'll have to show us some respect
and answer my questions.

112
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,600
- Which airline do you work for?
- I don't understand.

113
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,060
You must belong to an airline
or the airport authority to be in this area.

114
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,130
I've got nothing to do with the airport.
We'd just arrived. We were lost.

115
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,300
I was trying to find someone to help me,
and I saw him kill a man.

116
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,260
You say you'd just arrived? How did you get here?

117
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,776
We'll gain nothing by questioning her.

118
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:50,112
The important thing is that we've got her.

119
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,904
You don't think my friends
are just going to forget me like that, do you?

120
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,335
<i>I don't understand it, Doctor. Polly's nowhere to be seen.</i>

121
00:12:00,335 --> 00:12:02,100
<i>Something must have happened to her.</i>

122
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,580
<i>That's locked, Jamie.
There's nobody there.</i>

123
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,114
I'm afraid we're wasting our time here, Jamie.

124
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:13,890
The sooner we find the authorities and tell it to them, the better. Come on.

125
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,050
Yes, you're right. Your friends ARE worried about you.

126
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,980
Then we shall have to do something
to stop them worrying.

127
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,670
This seems to be the way, Jamie.

128
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,190
Excuse me... We're looking
for someone in authority.

129
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,960
Just a moment, sir. All in good time.

130
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,110
Thank you, madam.

131
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,980
Now, sir. Your passport, please.

132
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,869
I've got no time for that.
We want to see someone in authority.

133
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,310
- I am in authority. Your passport, please.

134
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,000
We have something important to report.

135
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,680
Yes, sir, when you've found your passport.
Next one, please.

136
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,070
- What's a passport?
- Official mumbo-jumbo. Look!

137
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,760
We've just discovered a dead body out there.

138
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,840
Did you hear me?

139
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,140
Well, sir. If I were you, I'd inform the police.

140
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,880
Please tell me where we can find them.

141
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:16,880
There's probably a policeman in the main concourse.

142
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:19,936
- And where is that?
- Through this door and turn to your left.

143
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,192
Thank you, thank you very much. Come on, Jamie.

144
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,620
May I see your passport, sir?

145
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,580
We neither of us have passports!
Does that satisfy you?

146
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:30,496
I think you must be mistaken, sir.

147
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,920
You couldn't have got on the aircraft without passports.

148
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,280
- What aircraft?
- The one you arrived on, sir.

149
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,080
We didn't arrive on an aircraft.

150
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:40,784
Now, look here, this joke's gone far enough.

151
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:43,660
You know and I know 
that you must have arrived on the last inbound flight

152
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:47,390
- which was flight 729 from Madri
- Tell him about the Tardis!

153
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,664
- What's that?
- It's the way we got here.

154
00:13:50,128 --> 00:13:52,416
You gentlemen wouldn't know anything about a police box, would you?

155
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,280
That's what I'm saying! We're...

156
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,880
I really think that our mode of  conveyance is irrelevant.

157
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,687
The important thing is that we discovered a dead body out there!

158
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:01,830
And we want to report it to someone in authority!

159
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:05,456
I think you'll have plenty of opportunity
to see someone in authority.

160
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,680
- Well, thank you.  Thank you very much.
- Will you take a seat, over there

161
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,590
Give me the commandant, please.

162
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,088
Hello, sir. Jenkins here. Immigration desk five.

163
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,600
I've got two of your suspects here.

164
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,070
Anyone here?

165
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,630
There must be someone around. Anyone here?

166
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,470
Hello. Is Captain Blade about?

167
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,400
I don't know. I'm a bit lost.

168
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,984
Are you looking for me?

169
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:04,480
Yes, I have your flight schedules here. They're all in order.

170
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,110
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

171
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,312
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for the way out.

172
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,780
This is private property. Visitors are not welcome.

173
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,240
Do you belong to the airport staff?

174
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,008
Yeah. I started today.

175
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:21,240
I didn't mean to come in here. I got lost.

176
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,240
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am.

177
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,640
Are you going to direct me or not?

178
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,360
Yes, of course. Come on.
I'll show you the way.

179
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:37,280
You say this girl witnessed a murder?

180
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,752

- Yes. She saw the man killed!

181
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:40,950
He was electrocuted with a ray gun.

182
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,584
- A what?
- Oh, what does it matter what sort of gun.

183
00:15:43,616 --> 00:15:45,648
The point is he was killed  and my friend saw it happen.

184
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,792
Where is she? I'd like to talk to her.

185
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,504
Well, that's another thing. She's vanished.

186
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:53,184
Oh, people who vanish, ray guns...
Is this some sort of joke?

187
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:55,696
You wouldn't think it a joke if you saw the body.

188
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,448
What flight did they come in on?

189
00:15:58,512 --> 00:16:02,192
Well, sir, they came in with the passengers from
flight 729 from Madrid,

190
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,792
but they've no passports.

191
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,928
Perhaps you'd kindly explain
why you have no passports.

192
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,168
Oh, look, we're all wasting time!

193
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,057
Are you going to come and see that body,

194
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:16,290
or am I going to find someone who really is in charge in this place?

195
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,612
I am in charge of this place, thank you.

196
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:21,370
Now, you both accompany me to this hangar immediately.

197
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,050
Thank you! Thank you very much. At last!

198
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,920
- Tell Air Traffic Control where I am.
- Yes, sir.

199
00:16:32,256 --> 00:16:34,032
Immigration desk five here.

200
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,160
Number One's just gone to the hangar area.
He wanted me to let you know.

201
00:16:38,672 --> 00:16:41,168
As a matter of fact, he's just gone to look for a dead body.

202
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,400
Yes, It's gonna be one of those days, isn't it?

203
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,728
- Get her?
- She's being processed.

204
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,504
They can take another on the next flight.

205
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,856
Excellent.

206
00:17:33,664 --> 00:17:35,520
The body - it's gone!

207
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,112
- You're quite you've got the right hangar?
- Aye. The name's up outside.

208
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,250
The body was lying just here.

209
00:17:44,336 --> 00:17:47,152
Well, let's see what we HAVE got, shall we?

210
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,717
What exactly are you doing?

211
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:58,749
For the police, of course. The trouble is I can't tell them who he was.

212
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:00,576
- Some sort of mystery man, no doubt.

213
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,570
Yes, as a matter of fact he was.
There was nothing in his pockets to identify him.

214
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,410
- A man with nothing in his pockets
- Yes, I was rather surprised myself.

215
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,410
- Wait. There WAS one thing.
- What did he have in his pocket?

216
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,584
This.

217
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:18,400
- A postage stamp
- But it's Spanish and it hasn't been used.

218
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,080
I'm sure that'll make all the difference.

219
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,930
Exactly. Hello... This is interesting.

220
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,570
What have you found now?

221
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,330
It's burnt fibres.

222
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:30,144
What about this, Doctor?

223
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,544
This wasn't here before. It's a burn mark.

224
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,992
You're right, Jamie. It's quite new.

225
00:18:35,952 --> 00:18:38,520
It's good to see someone is using their intelligence.

226
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,488
Oh, I've had enough of this! You two coming with me.

227
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,120
Definitely made by a ray gun.

228
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,176
Ray gun, burnt fibres, foreign stamps...

229
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,672
- Unused foreign stamps.
- All right, unused foreign stamps.

230
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,344
I must be as mad as you are, even to be listening to you!

231
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,488
- You know what they've done with it ? - Done with what?

232
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:56,896
The body. Somewhere there's a large packing case.

233
00:18:57,248 --> 00:18:59,136

- Right behind you, Doctor!

234
00:19:04,032 --> 00:19:07,296
- Can I help you?
- Are you connected with Chameleon Tours?

235
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:09,600
Yes. I'm Captain Blade - chief pilot.

236
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:14,290
These gentlemen think
there's an incident happened in here.

237
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,648
- An incident?
- Would you mind if we have a look in this packing case?

238
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:20,448
- May I ask who you are?
- I'm the commandant.

239
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:22,864
Yes, of course.

240
00:19:24,576 --> 00:19:26,920
What do you expect to find?

241
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,800
A dead man.

242
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,290
How very interesting.

243
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,360
Plastic cups! Now I'm going to do
some investigating of my own.

244
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,960
I'm glad I've roused your interest!

245
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,984
Oh, you have. But what I'm going to investigate is you.

246
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:51,952
and why you're both here in the airport.

247
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:54,032
Thank you, Captain Blade Come on, you two. Out.

248
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,032
We'd better humour him.

249
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,440
Bring him down.

250
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,480
It's all right.

251
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,856
Will he survive?
If we hurry.

252
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,224
There you are.

253
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:33,472
We've got to get you to the airport building
and you'll be safe.

254
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,384
He's reaching suffocation point. Hurry.

255
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,992
- You didn't let me search properly.
- That hangar is leased to a private charter company.

256
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:47,280
I've have no right to search in there.
Now, will you kindly sit down and keep quiet?

257
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,752
Jenkins, get onto Superintendent Reynolds.

258
00:20:51,088 --> 00:20:53,480
This is his job. These people are trespassing.

259
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,368
- I've just got another flight coming through.
- All right. I'll do it.

260
00:20:57,376 --> 00:20:58,720
Doctor, look!

261
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,120
- Commandant, this is the girl I was telling you about.
- I beg your pardon?

262
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,144
Do you know these gentlemen?

263
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,720
- No. Why? Should I?
- According to them, they know you.

264
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,920
- Where have you been, Polly?
- Polly?

265
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,150
My name isn't Polly.
You must have made a mistake.

266
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,000
I've never seen them before in my life.
