1
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:36,244
<i>Somebody help me, please.</i>

2
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:38,238
<i>I'm suffocatingI</i>

3
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:41,919
<i>QuicklyI Somebody help me, pleaseI</i>

4
00:00:42,087 --> 00:00:43,679
<i>I'm suffocatingI</i>

5
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:49,878
<i>Help meI PleaseI</i>

6
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:17,477
Yeah, but what about me brother?

7
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:23,085
I've got to look into this first. It's possible
that my colleague has been murdered.

8
00:03:23,247 --> 00:03:26,319
- Doctor, this man wants to talk to you.
- Who is he?

9
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:28,125
There you are, sir.

10
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:31,597
"Detective Inspector Crossland. Scotland Yard. "

11
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:35,157
- I told him everything.
- Have you ever seen that man?

12
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:38,478
He was in the Chameleon Tours hangar.

13
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:03,479
The Doctor's body. Where is it?

14
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:06,559
He... escaped.

15
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:13,321
His intelligence is far above normal beings.

16
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:16,001
Above YOURS, perhaps

17
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:21,635
I must leave. The flight to Zurich
is ready to take off. You will remain here.

18
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:26,198
- For what purpose?
- To atone for your incompetence.

19
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:30,645
The Doctor must die, and you must do it.

20
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:38,803
We'll talk to the commandant.
I want him to hear your story.

21
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:43,563
- He wasn't very impressed with it the last time.
- This time, he'll believe you.

22
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:45,479
Well, if you think so.

23
00:04:45,647 --> 00:04:48,798
Jamie, keep an eye on the kiosk.
We shan't be long.

24
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:52,357
Don't worry about your brother.
We'll find him for you.

25
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:55,439
A fat lot of good that inspector's going to be!

26
00:04:55,607 --> 00:04:59,805
- But he believes us.
- That doesn't mean he'll do anything.

27
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:03,999
I think I'll look round that Chameleon hangar.

28
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:08,479
- Not by yourself.
- Well, it would be better if I had a man with me.

29
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:12,196
Aye. If only the Doctor hadn't told me
to watch this place.

30
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:17,077
- Do you always do everything you're told?
- No, but the Doctor trusts me.

31
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:22,765
That's your trouble! All right, stay here.
After all, they can only murder me. Ta-ra.

32
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:26,044
Wait. I don't suppose anything will happen here.

33
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:30,359
- They've closed the kiosk, so it's unlikely.
- And we won't be long.

34
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:33,963
That depends on what we find. Come on, kid.

35
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:38,086
In any case, you need me
to show you the way there!

36
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:45,725
All right, all right.
I'll accept that you found a body,

37
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:50,438
but I still want to know where you come from
and why you have no passport.

38
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:55,317
- Surely that's unimportant?
- It is not unimportant to break the law!

39
00:05:56,287 --> 00:05:59,199
I think we'll have to let him tell us in his own way.

40
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,517
Very well. Make it brief.

41
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:07,125
Thank you. I have just carried out a search
of the Chameleon Tours hangar.

42
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:21,044
- Who's this one?
- I think he's one of your employees.

43
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:25,837
- Indeed?
- In fact, I think he may be in here.

44
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:39,922
Taxi, following southern taxi way
for departure runway 27...

45
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:54,316
- Do you know what this is?
- It looks like a fountain pen.

46
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:58,400
Things are not always what they seem.
Careful! It's dangerous.

47
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:02,924
- Chameleon Tours aren't what they seem either.
- What's your theory?

48
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:07,080
I'm afraid you won't believe it
when you hear it. However...

49
00:07:07,247 --> 00:07:12,275
First, Inspector Gascoigne
was murdered with a ray gun.

50
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:15,803
- A ray gun?
- It has not yet been developed on Earth.

51
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,642
- Oh, really!
- I knew you wouldn't believe it.

52
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,800
Be patient, sir.
We are trying to understand you.

53
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:28,165
Next, I believe Chameleon Tours
to be merely a front - a cover.

54
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:30,397
For what?

55
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,320
For the mass kidnapping of young people.

56
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:37,366
And is all this supposed
to be taking place in my airport?

57
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:42,203
- Yes. At this very moment.
- That's quite enough! Can't you arrest him?

58
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:46,406
He's only broken immigration law,
which isn't my responsibility.

59
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,286
- Brian Briggs IS your responsibility!
- Who?

60
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:53,599
- He went on the Chameleon tour and vanished.
- We don't know that.

61
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:57,760
Well, he's nowhere to be found,
and neither are my two friends,

62
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:03,718
which proves my point - Chameleon Tours
are a cover for the abducting of young people.

63
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:06,959
And just where do you think they're taking them?

64
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:12,599
Well, in view of the facts - the ray gun,
this pen and one or two other things -

65
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:18,802
- I think these people are not from this planet.
- That hardly... What did you say?!

66
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:24,284
- I knew you wouldn't believe me.
- This is absolute arrant nonsense!

67
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:28,679
I think you ought to produce some evidence
to support all this.

68
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:32,681
- What about this pen?
- A pen! Do you call that evidence

69
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,042
I'll demonstrate it for you.

70
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:41,241
Excuse me.

71
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,884
- Would you mind helping us?
- I don't understand.

72
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:48,800
Could you hold this cup out in front of you?

73
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,958
Very well.

74
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:57,566
- Perhaps you've seen one of these before?
- No. Agh!

75
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:04,078
It's turned to ice!

76
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:09,838
Do you call that arrant nonsense?

77
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:32,126
"Dear Mum and Dad. Have arrived safely in the
Black Forest. Will write again soon. Love, Tim. "

78
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,405
"Dear Dad, I... "

79
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,683
"Dear Mum... "

80
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:38,640
Jamie!

81
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:44,286
Jamie! Look what I've found.

82
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,517
There must be 50 postcards here.

83
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:52,557
- That should make that inspector do something.
- You're right, and I know where to find him.

84
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,759
You're a brave wee lassie.
No time to greet now.

85
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:59,839
Get off! I've got something in me eye. Come on.

86
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:03,479
Where are we going?

87
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,036
The commandant's office.

88
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:12,679
Here are the remaining flight schedules
for Chameleon Tours.

89
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:17,238
- What a nasty little device.
- I'd better get that checked over, sir.

90
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,967
Samantha, down here.

91
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:24,006
- Postcards! Look.
- I will not have my control room invaded!

92
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:27,079
- Not even for these?
- What have you got there?

93
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:30,876
I think it's the further evidence
you require, Inspector.

94
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:34,323
Yes... Just as I thought.

95
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:38,480
- Where did you get these?
- In the office in that hangar.

96
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:42,845
It's falling into a pattern.
This is addressed to somewhere in Germany.

97
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:47,717
Yeah. "Dem Chameleon Reisen, Freiberg. "
That means Chameleon Tours.

98
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:49,798
What are you all talking about?

99
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:55,837
They give out these cards, and get the kids
to write home to their parents before they go.

100
00:10:56,007 --> 00:11:00,797
The Chameleon Tours lot take the cards abroad
and post them back to Britain.

101
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:04,916
So the parents think the children
have arrived safely.

102
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,681
Doctor, what do you think happens to them?

103
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:10,805
Now, now. This is all mere supposition!

104
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:14,516
To you, maybe, but one of those kids
happens to be my brother.

105
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:18,599
- Your brother?
- Aye, her brother is missing.

106
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:21,918
She got a card from him in Rome.

107
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:25,921
Why would anyone want
to abduct these young people?

108
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:29,318
If we knew that, we wouldn't be sitting here.

109
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:32,445
Inspector, can I have a word with you?

110
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:39,516
You don't think this fellow's
a little unbalanced, do you?

111
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:44,477
He may be a wee bit unorthodox,
but he's given us the only lead we've got so far.

112
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:47,445
- If you gave him a free hand...
- A free hand?

113
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,201
Just to poke around a little bit, sir.

114
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:54,440
Do you think it's safe
to let the fellow roam around the airport?

115
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:57,360
You can rely on us to keep an eye on him, sir.

116
00:11:57,527 --> 00:11:59,597
All right, but on your head be it.

117
00:11:59,767 --> 00:12:05,842
I will investigate Chameleon Tours, then
I'll report back to you if I've found out anything.

118
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:10,125
In the meantime,
if you could keep everything going as normal.

119
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:13,085
We don't want them to get wind of anything.

120
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:20,805
Doctor, I'm giving you the freedom
of the airport for 12 hours, heaven help me.

121
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:25,643
At the end of that time,
I shall expect you back here with some real facts.

122
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:28,002
Thank you, Commandant.

123
00:12:32,727 --> 00:12:35,400
- Did they believe the Doctor?
- I don't know.

124
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:38,240
- What do you mean?
- I think he suspects me.

125
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:41,922
He turned one of our own weapons on me.
Forced me to leave.

126
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:45,045
You fool. You should have stayed.

127
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:48,961
Now, we do not know
how much he has discovered.

128
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:53,678
Even if he has discovered the secret
of our mission, they won't believe him.

129
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:56,486
These Earth minds cannot stretch that far.

130
00:12:56,647 --> 00:13:01,437
Of course, the truth is beyond their intelligence,
except for that Doctor.

131
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:04,679
I know where he is. I could kill him.

132
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:11,036
You're going to, but not at the risk of your own
safety. We still need you in Air Traffic Control.

133
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:16,166
Take this. Attach it to him.

134
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:20,036
When you're ready,
I shall activate the mechanism with this.

135
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:24,405
- That should put paid to him once and for all.
- Very well.

136
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:26,558
Don't delay.

137
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:30,083
I want him dead before Captain Blade returns.

138
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:39,722
Doctor...

139
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:43,402
- Here are passes for you and your friends.
- Thank you.

140
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:46,479
There's a Chameleon flight coming in now.

141
00:13:47,847 --> 00:13:51,806
<i>Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima
calling Gatwick Airport Control.</i>

142
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:55,039
Gatwick Control
to Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima.

143
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:02,837
Gatwick Control
to Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima.

144
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,805
I will now give you your heading.

145
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:11,762
- How many flights do they use a day?
- Seven or eight.

146
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:13,645
How many planes do they use?

147
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:19,518
- Four. I could get their registration numbers.
- Eight flights a day and only four planes.

148
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:23,236
Is that normal?
Yes. They have a very quick turnaround.

149
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:28,117
They're only on short-haul flights -
Spain, Rome, Athens, the Black Forest.

150
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:31,802
- I need the winter schedules.
- Excuse me.

151
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:36,882
- Which is the Chameleon plane?
- That one. I shall hold him over Epsom

152
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:39,038
until I get landing clearance.

153
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:42,279
- What's the range of your radar?
- 130 miles. Why?

154
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:46,201
- I wondered when this plane first appeared.
- I've no idea.

155
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:50,042
We don't notice them until they start to call in.
Excuse me.

156
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:53,040
<i>Gatwick Control
to Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima.</i>

157
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:58,725
<i>Climb to 10,000 feet and hold in
Epsom control zone to await landing clearance.</i>

158
00:14:58,887 --> 00:15:03,517
<i>Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima.
Climbing to 10,000 feet and holding.</i>

159
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:09,000
- How long do you hold them after take-off?
- Once they've left Gatwick Control Zone,

160
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:14,366
- we've finished with them.
- I see. That means they might be anywhere.

161
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:19,282
Aren't you wasting your 12 hours
hanging around here, disturbing my people?

162
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:24,237
I don't think I've been wasting a minute,
but I'll go if you insist. Sam! Jamie!

163
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:27,558
- Sorry.
- It's all right. It's my fault.

164
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:31,322
- Haven't I met you somewhere before?
- I don't think so.

165
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:34,399
You must have a double!

166
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:52,118
Thank you.

167
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:56,803
- Excuse me, are you the manager?
- I'm looking after bookings. Can I help?

168
00:15:56,967 --> 00:16:00,198
- I'd rather like to speak to the manager...
- Er...

169
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:03,359
- I'm a police officer.
- Is there some trouble?

170
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:07,918
- I'd prefer to speak to the person in charge.
- That's Captain Blade.

171
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:13,241
- He's about to take off on another flight.
- Perhaps I could go out to the plane?

172
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:15,716
I'll have to see about that.

173
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,798
Just a moment, please.

174
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:28,158
A detective wants to see you.

175
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:30,318
<i>Does he suspect anything?</i>

176
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:32,478
I don't know.

177
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:37,926
<i>All right. Send him over to the plane.
We'll deal with him.</i>

178
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:46,195
Are you sure this is the right room?
Have I ever been mistaken?

179
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:47,686
Aye!

180
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:51,999
Watch out. That's the wall
the gas nozzles came out of.

181
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:54,635
There's nothing here now.

182
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:58,638
You're right.

183
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:00,798
That's very clever.

184
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:03,401
Oh, well, it makes life simpler for us.

185
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:06,479
Now, the man I froze came from here somewhere.

186
00:17:06,647 --> 00:17:11,641
- Aye, he would - a solid wall
- Somewhere in that solid wall, there's a door.

187
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:15,083
- Where do you think Ben and Polly are?
- I don't know.

188
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:20,196
Perhaps if we find that door, we'll find them.
You take that end, I'll take this.

189
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:25,601
We must hurry.
Inspector's Crossland's keeping them busy,

190
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:30,397
but he'll be no match for them
if he presses them too far.

191
00:17:31,687 --> 00:17:33,678
Thank you.

192
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:41,322
The plane conforms strictly
to the international standards of air safety.

193
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:44,638
I can't think why anybody
would complain about us.

194
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:47,765
I'm not enquiring about safety.

195
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:52,443
My enquiries are about a missing boy.
A passenger on one of your flights.

196
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:57,635
Also, my colleague, Detective Inspector
Gascoigne, was last seen in your hangar.

197
00:17:57,807 --> 00:18:02,437
- He's believed to have been murdered.
- That is indeed a serious matter.

198
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:07,886
I'm afraid I have to ask you some questions.
Would you come to the commandant's office?

199
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:13,724
If you'll just excuse me for a moment,
I have some arrangements to make.

200
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:17,798
- Excuse me, please.
- I'm sorry.

201
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:29,518
Captain Blade!

202
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,676
I shouldn't move any further if I were you.

203
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:50,762
This gun proved remarkably effective
in dealing with Inspector Gascoigne.

204
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:54,363
- You killed him.
- Unfortunately, an error.

205
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:58,597
You Earth men are more use to us alive.

206
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,883
Sit down there.

207
00:19:08,687 --> 00:19:10,678
That's better.

208
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:20,685
This Earth man is a particularly
fine specimen, don't you think?

209
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:23,839
- Perhaps the director himself.
- Exactly.

210
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:28,239
Whatever you're doing,
I must warn you of the long arm of the British law.

211
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:31,604
I don't think it will reach where you're going.

212
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:36,045
Chameleon Flight 4-1-3 to Control.
Request start-up.

213
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:44,278
Jamie, look!

214
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,678
What's that, Doctor?

215
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:10,117
For someone who's not used
to the Earth's atmosphere.

216
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:12,164
Very interesting.

217
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:16,002
Ah! A TV monitor set. Let's see what we can see.

218
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:20,166
What's that?

219
00:20:20,327 --> 00:20:22,477
It looks like a hospital.

220
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:28,478
We're getting warmer - which is a change
from the last time I was here!

221
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:33,323
Come on. Let's see if there's
a first aid post in Gatwick airport.

222
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:41,921
- Shall we clear up the mess, Doctor?
- No, let's get along to the first aid post.

223
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:51,958
Oh, my back!

224
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,197
Jamie, my back!

225
00:21:04,247 --> 00:21:07,762
Please take a barley sugar. Thank you.

226
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:11,886
You can unfasten your seatbelts now. Thank you.

227
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:15,958
A barley sugar? Everything all right?

228
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:33,645
- All set.
- Good.

229
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,761
You wanted to know
what was the secret of Chameleon Tours.

230
00:21:49,447 --> 00:21:51,597
Well, Inspector...

231
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:56,282
See for yourself.
