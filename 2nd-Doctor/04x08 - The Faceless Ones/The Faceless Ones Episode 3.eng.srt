1
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:35,377
<i>Somebody help me, please.</i>

2
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,230
<i>I'm suffocatingI</i>

3
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,910
<i>QuicklyI Somebody help me, pleaseI</i>

4
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,670
<i>I'm suffocatingI</i>

5
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:47,000
<i>Help meI PleaseI</i>

6
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:15,488
Yeah, but what about me brother?

7
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,066
I'm afraid I've got something 
more serious to look into first, Miss.

8
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:20,750
If this young man's telling the truth, 
a colleague of mine's been murdered.

9
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:24,377
- Doctor, this man wants to talk to you.
- Oh, Who is he?

10
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,666
There you are, sir.

11
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:29,222
"Detective Inspector Crossland. Scotland Yard. "

12
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:32,600
- I told him everything.
- Have you ever seen that man?

13
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,977
He was in the Chameleon Tours hangar.

14
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,933
The Doctor's body. Where is it?

15
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,311
He... escaped.

16
00:03:54,777 --> 00:04:01,022
His intelligence is far above normal beings.

17
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:03,577
Above YOURS, perhaps

18
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:07,422
I must leave. The flight to Zurich
is ready to take off.

19
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:09,200
You will remain here.

20
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:13,711
- For what purpose?
- To atone for your incompetence.

21
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:17,933
The Doctor must die, and you must do it.

22
00:04:23,155 --> 00:04:25,000
All right then, Doctor, we'll go and see the commandant.

23
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:26,155
I want him to hear your story.

24
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,355
Well, he wasn't very impressed with it the last time.

25
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,111
This time, he's gonna believe you.

26
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,200
Well, if you think so.

27
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,790
Jamie, stay here and keep an eye on the kiosk.
We shan't be long.

28
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,350
Don't worry about your brother, Miss.
We'll find him for you.

29
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:44,670
- A fat lot of good that inspector's going to be! 
- But he believes us.

30
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:47,800
Oh, year, but that doesn't mean to say he's going to do anything.

31
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,990
I think I'll go and have a look round that Chameleon hangar.

32
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:56,470
- Not by yourself.
- Well, I suppose it would be better if I had a man with me.

33
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,190
Aye. If only the Doctor hadn't told me
to watch this place.

34
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,070
- Oh, do you always do everything you're told?
- No, but the Doctor trusts me.

35
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,488
Yeah, that's your trouble, isn't it! 
All right, stay here.

36
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:10,760
After all, they can only murder me. Ta-ra.

37
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,466
No, wait a minute. 
I don't suppose anything will happen here, do you?

38
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:18,350
- Since they closed the kiosk, so it's hardly likely.
- And we won't be long, will we?

39
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,355
Well, that depends on what we find. Come on, kid.

40
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:25,355
In any case, you need me
to show you the way there!

41
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,720
All right, all right.
I'll accept that you found a body,

42
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,177
but I still want to know where you come from
and why you have no passport.

43
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:43,310
- Surely that's unimportant?
- It is not unimportant to break the law!

44
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,190
Sir, I think we'll have to let him tell us in his own way.

45
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,510
Very well. Make it brief.

46
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,120
Thank you. I have just carried out a search
of the Chameleon Tours hangar.

47
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,488
In a packing case, I found the body of a man. 

48
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:00,355
You never told me that, Doctor. 
Another dead man? 

49
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:04,820
No, he was in a stupefied state, a sort of coma. 

50
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,711
- Who's this one?
- I don't know his name.

51
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:09,733
But I have a feeling he's one of your employees.

52
00:06:09,755 --> 00:06:13,377
- Oh, indeed?
- In fact, I think he may be in here.

53
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,920
Taxi, following southern taxi way
for departure runway 27...

54
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:37,288
- Do you know what this is?
- It looks like a fountain pen to me.

55
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,377
Things are not always what they seem.
Careful! It's dangerous.

56
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,440
- Chameleon Tours aren't what they seem either.
- What's your theory?

57
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:48,533
I'm afraid you won't believe it
when you hear it....

58
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:55,066
First, Inspector Gascoigne
was murdered with a ray gun.

59
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:58,888
- A ray gun?
- A weapon that has not yet been developed on this Earth.

60
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:02,088
- Oh, really!
- You see, I knew you wouldn't believe it.

61
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:05,066
No, now be patient, sir.
We are trying to understand you.

62
00:07:05,244 --> 00:07:11,288
Very well. Next, I believe Chameleon Tours
to be merely a front - a cover.

63
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,844
For what?

64
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,488
For the mass kidnapping of young people.

65
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:20,577
And is all this supposed
to be taking place in my airport?

66
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,533
- Yes. At this very moment.
- That's quite enough!

67
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,755
Can't you take that fellow into custody? 

68
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,577
Well, I'm very sorry, sir, but you know he hasn't broken any law.

69
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,950
except for this immigration business,
and that's not my responsibility.

70
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:32,488
- Brian Briggs IS your responsibility!
- Who is he?

71
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,888
He's a young man who went on the Chameleon tour and vanished.

72
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,840
Come on Doctor, wait a minute. 
We're not certain of that yet. 

73
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:40,460
Well, he's nowhere to be found,
and neither are my two friends,

74
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:47,311
which proves my point - Chameleon Tours
are a cover for the abducting of young people.

75
00:07:47,355 --> 00:07:49,650
And just where do you think they're taking them?

76
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:52,888
Well, in view of the facts that I've already presented

77
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:56,444
the ray gun, this pen, 
and one or two other things -

78
00:07:57,288 --> 00:07:59,933
I think we're dealing with people who are not from this planet

79
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,577
That hardly answers my que... 
What did you say?!

80
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:07,800
- You see, I knew you wouldn't believe me.
- This is absolute arrant nonsense!

81
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:12,244
Look, Doctor, I think you ought to
 produce some evidence to support all this.

82
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,866
- Evidence? What about this pen?
- A pen! Do you call that evidence? 

83
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:18,422
I'll demonstrate it for you.

84
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:24,355
Excuse me.

85
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:29,288
- Would you mind helping us?
- I don't understand.

86
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:31,777
Could you hold this cup out in front of you?

87
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:33,888
Very well.

88
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:40,260
- Perhaps you've seen one of these before?
- No. Agh!

89
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:47,600
It's turned to ice!

90
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:52,933
Do you call that arrant nonsense?

91
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,844
"Dear Mum and Dad. 
Have arrived safely in the Black Forest."

92
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,240
"Will write again soon. Love, Tim. "

93
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:17,800
"Dear Dad, I... "

94
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,466
"Dear Mum... "

95
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:22,440
Jamie!

96
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:28,080
Jamie! Look what I've found.

97
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,933
There must be 50 postcards here.

98
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,066
That should make that inspector do something.

99
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:34,822
You're right, and I know where to find him.

100
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:40,555
You're a brave wee lassie.
No time to greet now.

101
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,630
Get off! I've got something in me eye. Come on.

102
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,270
Where are we going?

103
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,555
The commandant's office.

104
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,470
Doctor, here are the remaining flight schedules
for Chameleon Tours you wanted.

105
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,577
- What a nasty little device.
- I'd better get that checked over, sir.

106
00:10:00,644 --> 00:10:02,866
- What the devil...
- Samantha, down here.

107
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,200
- Postcards! Look.
- I will not have my control room invaded!

108
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:09,977
- Not even for these?
- What have you got there?

109
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,200
I think it's the further evidence
you required, Inspector.

110
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:17,911
Yes... Just as I thought.

111
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,244
- Where did you get these?
- In the office in that hangar.

112
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,244
- You see what they mean? 
- All falling into a pattern.

113
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,333
This envelope is addressed to somewhere in Germany.

114
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:31,060
Yeah. "Dem Chameleon Reisen, Freiberg. "
That means Chameleon Tours.

115
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:33,590
Just what are you all talking about?

116
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,400
You see, they give out these cards,

117
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:39,630
and get the kids to write home to their parents
 before they go.

118
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,590
The Chameleon Tours lot take the cards abroad
and THEY post them back to Britain.

119
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:47,777
So the parents think the children
have arrived safely.

120
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,480
Doctor, what do you think happens to them?

121
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,600
Now, now. This is all mere supposition!

122
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,422
Oh, to you, maybe, but one of those kids
happens to be my brother.

123
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,622
- Your brother?
- Aye, sir. This is the young lady whose brother's missing

124
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:04,711
and you see, she did get a card from him in Rome.

125
00:11:04,888 --> 00:11:09,088
But why would anyone want
to abduct these young people?

126
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:12,044
Well, if we knew that, 
we wouldn't be sitting here.

127
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:15,400
Inspector, can I have a word with you?

128
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,533
You don't think this fellow's
a little unbalanced, do you?

129
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:24,622
Oh maybe a wee bit unorthodox, sir. 

130
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:27,177
But after all, he's given us the only lead we've got so far.

131
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,200
If you could just see your way to giving him a free hand.

132
00:11:29,244 --> 00:11:32,311
- A free hand?
- Just to poke around a little bit, sir.

133
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,644
Do you think it's safe
to let the fellow roam around the airport?

134
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:39,755
You can rely on us to keep an eye on him, sir.

135
00:11:40,622 --> 00:11:42,911
All right, but on your head be it.

136
00:11:43,422 --> 00:11:46,197
I personally will investigate Chameleon Tours

137
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:49,044
then I'll report back to you if I've found out anything.

138
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:53,088
In the meantime, if you could keep everything
 going as normal, you understand?

139
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,488
- We don't want them to get wind of anything.
- No, no, no, no, no.

140
00:11:57,688 --> 00:12:04,511
Doctor, I'm giving you the freedom
of the airport for 12 hours, heaven help me.

141
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:09,440
At the end of that time,
I shall expect you back here with some real facts this time.

142
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,800
Thank you, Commandant.

143
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:16,377
- Did they believe the Doctor?
- I don't know.

144
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,822
- What do you mean?
- I think he suspects me.

145
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:22,533
He turned one of our own weapons on me.
Forced me to leave.

146
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:26,177
You fool. You should have stayed.

147
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:29,800
Now, we do not know
how much he has discovered.

148
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:34,622
Even if he has discovered the secret
of our mission, they won't believe him.

149
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,555
These Earth minds cannot stretch that far.

150
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:42,555
Of course, the truth is beyond their intelligence,
except for that Doctor.

151
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,755
I know where he is. I could kill him.

152
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,222
You're going to, but not at the risk of your own safety.

153
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:52,155
We still need you in Air Traffic Control.

154
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:56,733
Take this. Attach it to him.

155
00:12:57,466 --> 00:13:00,600
When you're ready,
I shall activate the mechanism with this.

156
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:04,844
- That should put paid to him once and for all.
- Very well.

157
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,222
Don't delay.

158
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:10,755
I want him dead before Captain Blade returns.

159
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:18,422
Doctor...

160
00:13:18,555 --> 00:13:22,044
-  I've made out a pass for you and your two friends.
- Thank you.

161
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,070
Excuse me, sir. 
There's a Chameleon flight coming in now.

162
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:31,177
<i>Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima
calling Gatwick Airport Control.</i>

163
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,630
Gatwick Control
to Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima.

164
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,666
Gatwick Control
to Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima.

165
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,377
I will now give you your heading.

166
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,511
- How many flights do they use a day?
- Seven or eight.

167
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:53,466
- How many planes do they use?
- Four.

168
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:57,333
I could get their registration numbers 
if you like. Why do you ask?

169
00:13:57,511 --> 00:13:59,955
Eight flights a day and only four planes.
 Is that normal?

170
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:01,830
Yes. They have a very quick turnaround.

171
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,955
 I mean, after all they're only on short haul flights

172
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,933
You know, all the holiday centres.
Spain, Rome, Athens, the Black Forest.

173
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:10,400
- Jean, where's the file on winter schedules.
- Excuse me.

174
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,466
- Which is the Chameleon plane?
- Oh that one, sir. 

175
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,088
Look, he's turning left at Dunsfold.

176
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,000
I shall hold him now over Epsom 
until I can give him landing clearance. 

177
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:21,711
- What's the range of your radar?
- 130 miles. Why?

178
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,200
- I wondered when this plane first appeared.
- I've no idea, sir.

179
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:28,640
We don't notice them until they start to call in.
Now excuse me a moment.

180
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,666
<i>Gatwick Control
to Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima.</i>

181
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:36,888
<i>Climb to 10,000 feet and hold in
Epsom control zone to await landing clearance.</i>

182
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:42,311
<i>Alpha Delta Sierra X-ray Lima.
Climbing to 10,000 feet and holding.</i>

183
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,666
- How long do you hold them after take-off?

184
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:49,111
Once they've left Gatwick Control Zone, 
 we've finished with them.

185
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,600
I see. That means they might be anywhere.

186
00:14:53,777 --> 00:14:58,600
Aren't you wasting your 12 hours
hanging around here, disturbing my people?

187
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,511
I don't think I've been wasting a minute,

188
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:03,800
but I'll go if you insist. Sam! Jamie!

189
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:06,750
- Sorry. 
- It's all right. It's quite my fault.

190
00:15:07,422 --> 00:15:10,600
- Haven't I met you somewhere before?
- I don't think so.

191
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,622
You must have a double!

192
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:32,777
- Excuse me, are you the manager?
- I'm looking after bookings. Can I help?

193
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,333
- I'd rather like to speak to the manager...
- Er...

194
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,450
- I'm a police officer.
- Is there some trouble?

195
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,755
- I'd prefer to speak to the person in charge.
- That's Captain Blade.

196
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:45,377
He's just returned from one flight, taking off for another.

197
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:48,688
- He's rather busy at the moment.
- Perhaps I could go out to the plane?

198
00:15:49,711 --> 00:15:52,377
I'll have to see about that. 
Just a moment, please.

199
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:03,733
A detective wants to see you.

200
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:05,977
<i>Does he suspect anything?</i>

201
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:07,622
I don't know.

202
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:12,888
<i>All right. Send him over to the plane.
We'll deal with him.</i>

203
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:16,666
Are you sure this is the right room, Doctor?

204
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:19,688
- Jamie, have you ever known me to be mistaken?
- Aye!

205
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:22,444
- Hey. Now watch out. 
- What?

206
00:16:22,577 --> 00:16:25,200
That's the wall the gas nozzles came out of.

207
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:27,200
There's nothing here now.

208
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:30,555
You're right.

209
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:33,133
That's clever, very clever.

210
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:35,644
Oh, well, it makes life simpler for us.

211
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:39,111
Now, the man I froze came from here somewhere.

212
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:43,777
- Aye, he would - a solid wall
- Somewhere in that solid wall, there's a door.

213
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,777
Aye, and we still haven't found Ben and Polly.

214
00:16:45,911 --> 00:16:48,180
- What do you think's happened to them?
-  I don't know. 

215
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,116
Perhaps if we find that door, we'll find them.

216
00:16:51,116 --> 00:16:53,290
Come on. You take that end, I'll take this.

217
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,380
We must hurry.

218
00:16:56,444 --> 00:16:59,222
Inspector's Crossland's keeping them busy at the moment,

219
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:03,490
but he'll be no match for them
if he presses them too far.

220
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,755
You'll find that the whole plane conforms strictly
to the international standards of air safety.

221
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,511
I can't think why anybody
would complain about us.

222
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:20,860
Did I say anyone had complained?
I'm not enquiring about safety.

223
00:17:21,444 --> 00:17:25,222
My enquiries are about a missing boy.
A passenger on one of your flights.

224
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,377
And there's also the business of a colleague of mine, 
Detective Inspector Gascoigne, 

225
00:17:28,488 --> 00:17:31,955
was last seen in your hangar.
 He's believed to have been murdered.

226
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,244
That is indeed a serious matter.

227
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,066
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to hold up this flight
 a while, while I ask you some questions.

228
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:40,980
Would you mind coming to the commandant's office?

229
00:17:41,111 --> 00:17:46,000
If you'll just excuse me for a moment, Inspector,
I have some arrangements to make.

230
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,111
- Excuse me, please.
- I'm sorry.

231
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,088
Captain Blade!

232
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:18,444
I shouldn't move any further if I were you.

233
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:24,666
This gun proved remarkably effective
in dealing with your colleague, Inspector Gascoigne.

234
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:27,711
- You killed him.
- Unfortunately, an error.

235
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:31,333
You Earth men are more use to us alive.

236
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:34,555
Sit down there.

237
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,644
That's better.

238
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:54,044
This Earth man is a particularly
fine specimen, don't you think?

239
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:57,311
- Perhaps the director himself.
- Exactly.

240
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,800
Whatever you two are planning for me,
I must warn you of the long arm of the British law.

241
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:04,444
I don't think it will reach where you're going.

242
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:10,666
Chameleon Flight 4-1-3 to Control.
Request start-up.

243
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,822
Jamie, look!

244
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:40,422
What's that, Doctor?

245
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:45,710
For someone who's not used
to the Earth's atmosphere.

246
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,760
Very interesting.

247
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,600
Ah! A TV monitor set. Let's see what we can see.

248
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:56,088
What's that?

249
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,266
It looks like a hospital.

250
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:03,866
Jamie, we're getting warmer - which is a change
from the last time I was here!

251
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,920
Come on. Let's see if there's
a first aid post in Gatwick airport.

252
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,533
- Shall we clear up the mess, Doctor?
- No.

253
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,520
Let's get along to the first aid post.

254
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,911
Oh, my back!

255
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:29,790
Jamie, my back!

256
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:44,000
Please take a barley sugar. Thank you.

257
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,866
You can unfasten your seat belts now. Thank you.

258
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:53,600
A barley sugar? Everything all right?

259
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:12,200
- All set.
- Good.

260
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,160
You wanted to know
what was the secret of Chameleon Tours.

261
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,990
Well, Inspector...

262
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:34,911
See for yourself.
