1
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:12,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:35,904
You're quite sure you've never met these men? They say they know you.

3
00:01:36,104 --> 00:01:39,083
But they can't know me. This is my first visit to England!

4
00:01:39,284 --> 00:01:41,922
But Polly, it's us, me and the Doctor!

5
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:44,979
Would you mind telling us your name?

6
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:48,655
I am Michelle Leuppi from Zurich.

7
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:49,846
You have a passport?

8
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:51,317
Yes, of course. Here.

9
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:54,980
Have I done something wrong?

10
00:01:55,275 --> 00:02:02,650
Oh no, I don't suppose there's anything for you to worry about, Miss. May I just ask what you're doing in England?

11
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:06,292
I have come here to work. Look, here is my work permit.

12
00:02:08,589 --> 00:02:14,077
Oh, yes, that's quite in order. Thank you. Excuse me.

13
00:02:15,443 --> 00:02:17,525
Where did you learn such excellent English?

14
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:22,168
I had an English governess. Would you mind telling me what's happening?

15
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:26,594
Nothing that need concern you, miss, everything's perfectly in order. Now if you'd just like to go through there?

16
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:27,671
Thank you.

17
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,631
Polly, wait!

18
00:02:30,092 --> 00:02:31,753
Just a minute young man.

19
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,044
But she's a friend of ours - and she saw the murder!

20
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,074
You're going to wait here until the Superintendent of police arrives - now understand that?

21
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:40,800
Ah, you're going to tell him about the dead body, very sensible.

22
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:45,950
No. I am going to tell him about you. Put me through to Superintendent Reynolds.

23
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:52,440
Jamie, I don't think we're very welcome here. When I say run, we run!

24
00:02:52,710 --> 00:03:00,431
Hello Super, Commandant. I've got a couple of illegal entrants here. Yes... Immigration Desk Number Five.

25
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:01,555
Run!

26
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:02,789
Commandant!

27
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:06,890
Situation changed. They've just made a run for it. I'll give you their description...

28
00:03:13,256 --> 00:03:14,907
Quick! He's suffocating.

29
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:17,087
You were twenty minutes late.

30
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,569
Who is he?

31
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:44,703
Meadows - Air Traffic Control.

32
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:48,454
Good! He may be useful to us.

33
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,518
They're still hunting for us, Doctor.

34
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:50,366
Yes. We'll have to keep out of their way until we can prove our story.

35
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,585
A fine chance we have of doing that - with Polly kidding on she doesn't know us!

36
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:58,497
I don't think Polly was kidding on. In fact I don't think that was Polly.

37
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,892
Of course, it was Polly! You saw her!

38
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,891
You don't want to believe everything you see, Jamie.

39
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:03,831
Doctor!

40
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:13,456
All clear, Doctor.

41
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:15,859
Doctor!

42
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:23,144
Yes, Chameleon Tours.

43
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:31,134
An advertisement for Chameleon Youth Tours. "Budget Tours for young people between the ages of eighteen and twenty five. "

44
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:32,445
What do they mean by budget?

45
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:39,904
Inexpensive, cheap! This could be the bait. Do you know what a chameleon is, Jamie?

46
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:41,518
It's just a name, I suppose?

47
00:05:41,683 --> 00:06:03,302
It is the name of a small animal, a lizard that can change it's colour to merge with it's background. But it's a name that could equally be applied to people as well. People who change their personalities to suit their own ends. Budget Tours... young people between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five. Oh yes, there's something strange going on here.

48
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:04,405
Doctor! Jamie!

49
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:05,623
Ben! Are you all right?

50
00:06:05,788 --> 00:06:06,489
Yeah, I'm okay.

51
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:07,298
Well that's a relief.

52
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,996
What happened to you two and where's Polly?

53
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:14,706
We can't talk here. We've got to find somewhere to hide. Something about passports.

54
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,136
I've got the very place. Come on.

55
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:41,500
Is he all right?

56
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:42,705
We'll see.

57
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:58,063
Read the first line!

58
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:06,309
Vocal control.

59
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:13,819
Try that.

60
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:19,889
H... X... O... A...

61
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:40,428
All complete.

62
00:07:45,563 --> 00:07:46,630
Who are you?

63
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:53,999
My name is George Meadows. I work at Air Traffic Control, Gatwick Airport.

64
00:07:55,402 --> 00:07:56,763
Where do you live?

65
00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:59,024
Number Ten, Sylvia Avenue.

66
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:01,235
Number Ten?

67
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:09,348
Until last week, We lived at Number Thirty-Four. I've been too busy to tell the Personnel Department of the change.

68
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,968
Excellent!

69
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,482
Look! There's Polly!

70
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:33,476
Yes, look who she's working for!

71
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:34,802
Chameleon Tours.

72
00:08:35,426 --> 00:08:37,108
Yes, leave this to me.

73
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,355
Polly.

74
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:45,759
Please go away.

75
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:51,600
Now, something has happened to you, Polly. I want you to try to remember up to the time we left the hangar.

76
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,637
I don't know what you're talking about.

77
00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:59,689
Now think, Polly. There were three of us in the hangar. You were showing us something. Now what was it?

78
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:01,721
I tell you, I don't know what you're talking about.

79
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,581
The hangar, Polly, The Chameleon Hangar. You said you'd seen the man who did it.

80
00:09:06,988 --> 00:09:12,659
I didn't see anything. I think you're mad. If I'd seen anyone shot, I'd have gone to the police...

81
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:13,742
Anyone shot?

82
00:09:14,206 --> 00:09:16,780
I... I mean murdered...

83
00:09:17,013 --> 00:09:19,876
I didn't say anyone was shot, or murdered, Polly.

84
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:21,588
Look, please, will you just leave me alone.

85
00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:26,911
What's happened to her, Doctor?

86
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:33,054
I don't know. But I mean to find out. Come on, let's find that place where we can talk.

87
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,494
Right.

88
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:40,169
Come in here.

89
00:09:45,237 --> 00:09:48,843
I was going to brief you for this assignment, but there isn't any purpose, now.

90
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:51,388
I have failed, then?

91
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:57,612
Circumstances are against you. I'll make arrangements for you to leave on the next flight.

92
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:00,287
Back to base?

93
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,385
Yes.

94
00:10:02,626 --> 00:10:05,738
What about that man? He's very persistent.

95
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,649
Don't worry about him. We have ways of dealing with such people...

96
00:10:40,394 --> 00:10:41,776
Are you sure you haven't seen him, sir?

97
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:48,349
I'm quite sure! Oh Jean, this is Detective Inspector Crossland. Give him any help you can. If you'll excuse me?

98
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:49,582
Yes, of course, sir.

99
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:52,859
Well now Inspector, what can I do for you?

100
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:54,984
Well, I think I'll need a pass for a start.

101
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:56,481
Well that's easily arranged.

102
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,706
Anything else?

103
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:01,557
Yes, I was supposed to meet a colleague of mine here, a Detective Inspector Gascoigne.

104
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:02,403
Yes?

105
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:08,217
Well, he was investigating a missing person off one of your charter flights. The funny thing is, he hasn't shown up!

106
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:10,038
Detective-Inspector Crossland...

107
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:11,437
What shall I say your business is?

108
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:15,889
Investigation into Chameleon Youth Tours.

109
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:35,307
What is this place?

110
00:11:35,503 --> 00:11:36,830
It's a machine that takes your photograph.

111
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:37,863
Photograph?

112
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:39,550
Well, you see you've got...

113
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,515
No Ben, not now. What puzzles me is this girl pretending to be Polly, yet... yet in a way, she is Polly.

114
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:45,995
Do you think she's been brainwashed?

115
00:11:46,311 --> 00:11:50,790
No, not in the time. Whatever happened to her happened to her in a few minutes. Look out!

116
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:06,022
All right. Now Ben, Jamie, we've got to find out more about Chameleon Youth Tours, but the trouble is, we're not free to move around with the authorities looking for us.

117
00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:07,634
Well, they're not looking for me.

118
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:11,210
Well, that's true. You could investigate the hangar.

119
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:12,565
Leave it to me. Now what about you?

120
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:16,564
I'm going back to the Commandant and try and convince him that there's a murderer abroad.

121
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:17,961
Well I'll go with Ben.

122
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:22,332
No, Jamie, I want you to find your way back to the Chameleon kiosk and keep an eye on Polly.

123
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:15,293
Oh! Err, are you in charge here?

124
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:17,112
Ah, yes. Can I help you?

125
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:20,459
Yes. I... I'm Samantha Briggs and I've come down from Liverpool.

126
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,902
Oh, really?

127
00:13:22,877 --> 00:13:25,061
It's about my brother, Brian Briggs -

128
00:13:25,657 --> 00:13:27,455
What about him?

129
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:31,096
He went on one of your tours, and now he's disappeared.

130
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:34,690
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

131
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:41,850
Well, it's really very simple. I tried to get the telephone number of the hotel you sent him to, and the operator said there was no such place.

132
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:44,781
Well, the operator must have been mistaken then.

133
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:53,201
So... I got in touch with the police and they said that Brian wasn't staying at any hotel in Rome.

134
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:58,574
Well, um, perhaps he changed his mind and decided to go on a different tour then.

135
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:05,382
Well what about this then? A post-card from Brian, posted in Rome!

136
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:11,849
Yes, that does seem odd, doesn't it. Erm, would you like me to make some enquiries, for you?

137
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:16,383
Well, what do you think I've come all the way down from Liverpool for?

138
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,254
Well - since you've put the matter with the police, why have you?

139
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:25,241
Police. They said that dozens of people go missing every week and they haven't got the men to go chasing after them all.

140
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:28,214
I see. What did you say your brother's name was?

141
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:34,085
Brian Briggs. Would you like me to spell it for you?

142
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:39,730
That won't be necessary, thank you. I'll see what I can find out, if you don't mind waiting.

143
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:51,264
Is Captain Blade there?

144
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:52,576
No.

145
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:57,098
Well, I must speak with him - urgently. Enquiries about a missing passenger.

146
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,453
I'll tell him to contact you. He shouldn't be long.

147
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:10,720
The gentleman I wanted to speak with wasn't available, they're trying to find him. Do you want to wait?

148
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:15,250
Well, I've got nothing else to do, have I? I'll be over there.

149
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:17,593
Oh blast!

150
00:15:22,314 --> 00:15:23,778
Is anything the matter?

151
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:25,240
Stuck up thing!

152
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:26,300
What?

153
00:15:26,588 --> 00:15:31,854
Not you. That girl! She just couldn't care less.

154
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:33,547
About finding your brother.

155
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:34,536
Yes.

156
00:15:34,845 --> 00:15:38,734
I couldn't help overhearing. Do you think something's happened to him.

157
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:46,074
Well, that's just it, I don't know. Oh, Brian can take care of himself all right, but still...

158
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:47,396
Aye, well I hope you're right.

159
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:49,064
What d'you mean?

160
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:55,520
I might just be able to help you. I can't tell you anything at the moment but later I'd like you to meet a friend of mine. I'm sure he'll know what's best.

161
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:10,048
Excuse me, sir.

162
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:13,099
There's a gentleman to see you.

163
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:14,451
Did he say what about?

164
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,980
Well yes. It's about a dead body.

165
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:21,368
Bring him in.

166
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:24,356
Would you come in, please?

167
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:25,294
Thank you.

168
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:29,413
Ah, Commandant. How nice to see you again.

169
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:31,953
Airport Police please.

170
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:35,119
At least hear what I have to say.

171
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:36,922
I've heard all I want to from you.

172
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:40,126
What do you mean, they're engaged. This is the Commandant. Thank you.

173
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:46,693
If you're going to speak to the police, then tell them that there's something happening in this airport that may endanger human lives.

174
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:50,983
Hello police? Commandant. Would you send a couple of men down here at once please.

175
00:16:53,489 --> 00:17:00,551
Since I'm obviously about to be arrested may I make one last request? Listen to me for just one minute.

176
00:17:00,807 --> 00:17:07,250
Not for one second. I've heard all I want to hear about burnt fibres, ray guns, disappearing people...

177
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:10,095
But there was a dead body in the Chameleon Tours hangar!

178
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,815
Did you say "Chameleon Tours"?

179
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:12,904
Why, do you know something about it?

180
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:14,596
Well no, but the Inspector Crossland wanted to know...

181
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:16,110
All right, Jean. I'll handle this.

182
00:17:16,323 --> 00:17:19,726
Ah, take this man away, put him under lock and key and keep him there!

183
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:23,537
One step nearer and I'll blow you all to smithereens!

184
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,064
Catch!

185
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,058
All right, after him!

186
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:36,809
That's quite clear, is it? You know what to tell her?

187
00:17:37,134 --> 00:17:38,131
I do.

188
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:45,617
As soon as you've got rid of the girl, close the kiosk and get on the next flight.

189
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:52,057
Miss Briggs.

190
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:53,951
Yes. Have you found anything?

191
00:17:54,190 --> 00:18:02,620
Err, well yes, I have. But I'm afraid it doesn't help very much. Your brother definitely did get on our flight to Rome, but what he did when he got off the plane, I couldn't tell you.

192
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:05,391
Well, if you can't, who can?

193
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:18,334
Miss Briggs, We're dealing with thousands of passengers every week. We can't keep track of every single one. If I were you, I'd go back to Liverpool. I'm sure your brother will turn up eventually. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to close this kiosk.

194
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,164
Thanks for nothing.

195
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:27,034
There's something funny going on here.

196
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:27,872
Why?

197
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:30,980
My brother's vanished, and that lot just couldn't care less.

198
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:30,368
Hello? What's the name of the man who's in charge of this airport? The Commandant? Right, well look, can you put me through to his office, please? All right, then Air Traffic Control but I want to speak to a friend of mine who should be with the Commandant, right now...

199
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:36,940
Doctor, I'd like you to meet this young lady.

200
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,158
What young lady? Where's Polly?

201
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:40,798
She's still inside.

202
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:42,696
Ah, I shan't be a minute.

203
00:19:46,803 --> 00:19:47,793
Polly...

204
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:19,360
But why wouldn't you listen to him? It's all true. I'm in the Chameleon Hangar now and I've just f...

205
00:20:19,574 --> 00:20:20,334
Ben!

206
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,633
Ben, can you hear me?

207
00:20:25,995 --> 00:20:27,774
Ben, can you hear me?

208
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:47,255
Ben, are you all right, can you hear me? Ben! Ben! Ben, can you hear me?

209
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:50,742
Who is he?

210
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:52,490
A friend of that Doctor on the screen.

211
00:20:53,645 --> 00:20:55,087
Did he see what happened in there?

212
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:56,429
He must have done.

213
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:02,597
Then he'll be coming here. We'd better be prepared for him. First, dispose of the body.

214
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:08,841
Who is he?

215
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:12,467
His name's Brian Briggs. Supposed to have come through here about a week ago, on holiday.

216
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:14,429
Thousands of people come through here a week.

217
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,738
Aye, well it was just a chance.

218
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:17,123
Do you remember that man?

219
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:21,162
Oh yes, I remember him. He had a pass. But I can't remember his name.

220
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:25,170
He's a colleague of mine, Detective Inspector Gascoigne. Now when did he come back?

221
00:21:25,804 --> 00:21:31,291
I couldn't tell you. There are so many faces. There was a bit of bother this morning, he could have slipped through then.

222
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:32,533
What sort of bother?

223
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:36,822
Two people without passports, who told some sort of story about a body in a hangar.

224
00:21:37,785 --> 00:21:38,948
What happened?

225
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:43,576
Ah, it was all a hoax. These two men they ran away. The airport police are still looking for them!

226
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:45,243
Can you describe them to me?

227
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:53,334
One was a scruffy-looking man, medium-height, wearing a frock-coat, the other was a Scots boy dressed in a kilt!

228
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,079
Oh, shouldn't be too hard to find.

229
00:22:01,797 --> 00:22:04,671
Hey, you think we should go after your friend? He's been gone about ten minutes now.

230
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:07,093
No, he said half a hour. Now, we'll do what he said.

231
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:11,506
Hey, he is a right weirdy, isn't he?

232
00:22:11,702 --> 00:22:14,299
No! I wish I had his brains.

233
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,951
You're all right as you are.

234
00:22:26,224 --> 00:22:36,826
Chameleon Youth Tours announce the departure of their flight Number Four-One-Three to Zurich. Will all passengers please assemble in the departure lounge. Chameleon Youth Tours ann...

235
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:39,277
Hey, look, they've opened up that kiosk now.

236
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:40,909
Aye, and where's Polly?

237
00:22:41,116 --> 00:22:44,204
...Will all passengers please assemble in the departure lounge.

238
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:21,972
Packing cases!

239
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:38,601
I'm quite sure the first thing you want to do when you get to Switzerland is write home to your parents... But in case you don't have time, Chameleon Tours have some postcards of Zurich ready for you to write here. When you've finished your postcards, give them back to me and we'll post them for you in Zurich.

240
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,643
Eh, do you mind?

241
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:42,863
No, go ahead.

242
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:48,961
Look! A postcard of Zurich, stamped with a Swiss stamp, all ready to post.

243
00:23:49,293 --> 00:23:50,006
Well?

244
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:58,339
Oh, you're a right one, aren't you. Don't you see. This could explain the card I got from Brian. It was posted in Rome, but that doesn't mean to say that he posted it!

245
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:04,223
Oh I see. We'd better tell the Doctor about this! Er, how long's he been gone?

246
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:05,759
Err, about half a hour, now.

247
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:07,074
Right, I'll go and find him.

248
00:24:07,308 --> 00:24:08,226
I'll come with you.

249
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:11,131
Just a minute, son. I want a word with you.

250
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:25,343
Somebody, help me... please... I'm suffocating...

251
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:39,321
Quickly, somebody help me please... I'm suffocating... Help me, please!
