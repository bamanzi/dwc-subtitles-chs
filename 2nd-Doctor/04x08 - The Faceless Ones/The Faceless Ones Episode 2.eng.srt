1
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:12,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,650
You're quite sure you've never met these men?
They say they know you.

3
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,830
But they can't know me. This is my first visit to England!

4
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,670
But Polly, it's us, me and the Doctor!

5
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,720
Would you mind telling us your name?

6
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:46,912
I am Michelle Leuppi from Zurich.

7
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:47,960
You have a passport?

8
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:49,584
Yes, of course. Here.

9
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:53,120
Have I done something wrong?

10
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:57,184
Oh no, I don't suppose there's anything
for you to worry about, Miss.

11
00:01:58,448 --> 00:02:01,400
May I just ask what you're doing in England?

12
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,496
I have come here to work. Look, here is my work permit.

13
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:11,984
Oh, yes, that's quite in order. Thank you. Excuse me.

14
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,424
Where did you learn such excellent English?

15
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,605
I had an English governess.

16
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:19,792
Would you mind telling me what's happening?

17
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,489
Nothing that need concern you, miss,
everything's perfectly in order.

18
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,304
Now if you'd just like to go through there?

19
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,200
Thank you.

20
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,130
Polly, wait!

21
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,250
Just a minute young man.

22
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:31,392
But she's a friend of ours - and she saw the murder!

23
00:02:31,456 --> 00:02:35,570
You're going to wait here until the Superintendent
of police arrives - now understand that?

24
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,300
Ah, you're going to tell him about the dead body, very sensible.

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,120
No. I am going to tell him about you.

26
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,616
Put me through to Superintendent Reynolds.

27
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:47,728
Jamie, I don't think we're very welcome here.

28
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,424
When I say run, we run!

29
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,583
Hello Super, Commandant.

30
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:54,448
I've got a couple of illegal entrants here.

31
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:57,360
Yes... Immigration Desk Number Five.

32
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:58,080
Run!

33
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,344
Commandant!

34
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,208
Situation changed. They've just made a run for it.

35
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,590
I'll give you their description...

36
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,600
Quick! He's suffocating.

37
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,780
You were twenty minutes late.

38
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,460
Who is he?

39
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:40,600
Meadows - Air Traffic Control.

40
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,350
Good! He may be useful to us.

41
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,910
They're still hunting for us, Doctor.

42
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,760
Yes. We'll have to keep out of their way
until we can prove our story.

43
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,980
A fine chance we have of doing that -
with Polly kidding on she doesn't know us!

44
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,890
I don't think Polly was kidding on.
In fact I don't think that was Polly.

45
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,290
Of course, it was Polly! You saw her!

46
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,976
You don't want to believe everything you see, Jamie.

47
00:04:57,056 --> 00:04:57,824
Doctor!

48
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,552
All clear, Doctor.

49
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:09,760
Doctor!

50
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,800
Yes, Chameleon Tours.

51
00:05:16,912 --> 00:05:20,480
An advertisement for Chameleon Youth Tours.

52
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,736
"Budget Tours for young people
between the ages of eighteen and twenty five. "

53
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,728
- What do they mean by budget?
- Inexpensive, cheap!

54
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:33,536
This could be the bait.
Do you know what a chameleon is, Jamie?

55
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:35,152
It's just a name, I suppose?

56
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,328
It is the name of a small animal, a lizard

57
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:40,176
that can change it's colour to merge with it's background.

58
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,912
But it's a name that could equally be applied to people as well.

59
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,072
People who change their personalities to suit their own ends.

60
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,648
Budget Tours... young people
between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five

61
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,272
Oh yes, there's something strange going on here.

62
00:05:56,336 --> 00:05:58,304
- Doctor! Jamie!
-Ben! Are you all right?

63
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,856
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Well that's a relief.

64
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:01,536
What happened to you two and where's Polly?

65
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,624
We can't talk here. We've got to find somewhere to hide.

66
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,504
Something about passports.

67
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:09,030
I've got the very place. Come on.

68
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:33,376
Is he all right?

69
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:34,400
We'll see.

70
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,760
Read the first line!

71
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:58,000
Vocal control.

72
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,008
Try that.

73
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:10,768
H... X... O... A...

74
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:31,088
All complete.

75
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,830
Who are you?

76
00:07:38,464 --> 00:07:40,720
My name is George Meadows.

77
00:07:41,264 --> 00:07:44,304
I work at Air Traffic Control, Gatwick Airport.

78
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,960
Where do you live?

79
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,220
Number Ten, Sylvia Avenue.

80
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,430
Number Ten?

81
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,072
Until last week, We lived at Number Thirty-Four.

82
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:59,540
I've been too busy to tell the Personnel Department of the change.

83
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,160
Excellent!

84
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:20,680
- Look! There's Polly!  - Yes.

85
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:22,800
Look who she's working for!

86
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:24,672
- Chameleon Tours.  - Yes.

87
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:26,768
Leave this to me.

88
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,350
Polly.

89
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,750
Please go away.

90
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,255
Now, something has happened to you, Polly.

91
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,600
I want you to try to remember up to the time we left the hangar.

92
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,630
I don't know what you're talking about.

93
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,824
Now think, Polly. There were three of us in the hangar.

94
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,528
You were showing us something. Now what was it?

95
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,384
I tell you, I don't know what you're talking about.

96
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,896
The hangar, Polly, The Chameleon Hangar.

97
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:55,580
You said you'd seen the man who did it.

98
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,720
I didn't see anything. I think you're mad.

99
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,136
If I'd seen anyone shot, I'd have gone to the police...

100
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:02,080
Anyone shot?

101
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
I... I mean murdered...

102
00:09:05,776 --> 00:09:08,128
I didn't say anyone was shot, or murdered, Polly.

103
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:10,272
Look, please, will you just leave me alone.

104
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:14,912
What's happened to her, Doctor?

105
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:17,287
I don't know. But I mean to find out.

106
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:20,330
Come on, let's find that place where we can talk.

107
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:28,256
Come in here.

108
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
I was going to brief you for this assignment,

109
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:36,780
but there isn't any purpose, now.

110
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:38,992
I have failed, then?

111
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:41,338
Circumstances are against you.

112
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,392
I'll make arrangements for you to leave on the next flight.

113
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,328
Back to base?

114
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:48,720
Yes.

115
00:09:50,032 --> 00:09:52,736
What about that man? He's very persistent.

116
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,072
Don't worry about him.

117
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,992
We have ways of dealing with such people...

118
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,400
Are you sure you haven't seen him, sir?

119
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:30,032
I'm quite sure!

120
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:34,016
Oh Jean, this is Detective Inspector Crossland.
Give him any help you can.

121
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:35,888
- If you'll excuse me? - Yes, of course, sir.

122
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:39,472
Well now Inspector, what can I do for you?

123
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,380
Well, I think I'll need a pass for a start.

124
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,880
Well that's easily arranged.

125
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,100
Anything else?

126
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:46,560
Yes, I was supposed to meet a colleague of mine here,

127
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:48,480
- a Detective Inspector Gascoigne.   - Yes?

128
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:52,475
Well, he was investigating a missing person
off one of your charter flights.

129
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:54,336
The funny thing is, he hasn't shown up!

130
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,952
Detective-Inspector Crossland...

131
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:57,680
What shall I say your business is?

132
00:10:57,776 --> 00:11:01,840
Investigation into Chameleon Youth Tours.

133
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:20,864
What is this place?

134
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:22,530
It's a machine that takes your photograph.

135
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:23,560
Photograph?

136
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:25,152
Well, you see you've got...

137
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,592
No Ben, not now. What puzzles me is
this girl pretending to be Polly, yet...

138
00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:30,210
yet in a way, she is Polly.

139
00:11:30,304 --> 00:11:31,690
Do you think she's been brainwashed?

140
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,028
No, not in the time.

141
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,144
Whatever happened to her happened to her in a few minutes. Look out!

142
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:46,304
All right. Now Ben, Jamie, we've got to find out
more about Chameleon Youth Tours,

143
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:51,248
but the trouble is, we're not free to
move around with the authorities looking for us.

144
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:52,720
Well, they're not looking for me.

145
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:56,176
Well, that's true. You could investigate the hangar.

146
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:57,344
Leave it to me. Now what about you?

147
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:58,892
I'm going back to the Commandant

148
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:01,472
and try and convince him that there's a murderer abroad.

149
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:02,832
Well I'll go with Ben.

150
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:07,056
No, Jamie, I want you to find your way back
to the Chameleon kiosk and keep an eye on Polly.

151
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,104
Oh! Err, are you in charge here?

152
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:00,896
Ah, yes. Can I help you?

153
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,808
Yes. I... I'm Samantha Briggs and I've come down from Liverpool.

154
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:05,648
Oh, really?

155
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:08,560
It's about my brother, Brian Briggs -

156
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,496
What about him?

157
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,590
He went on one of your tours, and now he's disappeared.

158
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,760
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

159
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,952
Well, it's really very simple.

160
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:23,248
I tried to get the telephone number of the hotel you sent him to,

161
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,350
and the operator said there was no such place.

162
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,016
Well, the operator must have been mistaken then.

163
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,560
So... I got in touch with the police

164
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:36,144
and they said that Brian wasn't staying at any hotel in Rome.

165
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:41,360
Well, um, perhaps he changed his mind
and decided to go on a different tour then.

166
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,320
Well what about this then?

167
00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:48,880
A post-card from Brian, posted in Rome!

168
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,056
Yes, that does seem odd, doesn't it?

169
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:55,340
Erm, would you like me to make some enquiries, for you?

170
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:58,704
Well, what do you think I've come all the way down from Liverpool for?

171
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:01,904
Well - since you've put the matter with the police, why have you?

172
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:05,600
Police. They said that dozens of people go missing every week

173
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:08,048
and they haven't got the men to go chasing after them all.

174
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:10,608
I see. What did you say your brother's name was?

175
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:16,560
Brian Briggs. Would you like me to spell it for you?

176
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,344
That won't be necessary, thank you.

177
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:22,144
I'll see what I can find out, if you don't mind waiting.

178
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,392
Is Captain Blade there?

179
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,570
No.

180
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:39,090
Well, I must speak with him - urgently.
Enquiries about a missing passenger.

181
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,450
I'll tell him to contact you. He shouldn't be long.

182
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,160
The gentleman I wanted to speak with wasn't available,

183
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,720
they're trying to find him. Do you want to wait?

184
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:55,104
Well, I've got nothing else to do, have I?

185
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:56,832
I'll be over there.

186
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:02,800
Oh blast!

187
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,104
Is anything the matter?

188
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,592
Stuck up thing!

189
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,448
- What?  - Not you.

190
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,056
That girl! She just couldn't care less.

191
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,680
About finding your brother.

192
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,808
- Yes.   - I couldn't help overhearing.

193
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:19,824
Do you think something's happened to him.

194
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:22,464
Well, that's just it, I don't know.

195
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:26,832
Oh, Brian can take care of himself all right, but still...

196
00:15:26,912 --> 00:15:28,272
Aye, well I hope you're right.

197
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:31,060
- What d'you mean?  - I might just be able to help you.

198
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,088
I can't tell you anything at the moment

199
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,880
but later I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

200
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:36,736
I'm sure he'll know what's best.

201
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,540
Excuse me, sir.

202
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,590
There's a gentleman to see you.

203
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,950
Did he say what about?

204
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:57,480
Well yes. It's about a dead body.

205
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:01,860
Bring him in.

206
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:04,850
- Would you come in, please?  - Thank you.

207
00:16:06,352 --> 00:16:09,910
Ah, Commandant. How nice to see you again.

208
00:16:10,384 --> 00:16:12,450
Airport Police please.

209
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,056
At least hear what I have to say.

210
00:16:15,136 --> 00:16:16,800
I've heard all I want to from you.

211
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:19,952
What do you mean, they're engaged.
This is the Commandant. Thank you.

212
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,912
If you're going to speak to the police, then tell them that

213
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:26,816
there's something happening in this airport
that may endanger human lives.

214
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,720
Hello police? Commandant.

215
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:31,312
Would you send a couple of men down here at once please.

216
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:37,050
Since I'm obviously about to be arrested
may I make one last request?

217
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:39,728
Listen to me for just one minute.

218
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,792
Not for one second.

219
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,560
I've heard all I want to hear about burnt fibres,
ray guns, disappearing bodies...

220
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:49,200
But there was a dead body in the Chameleon Tours hangar!

221
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,448
Did you say "Chameleon Tours"?

222
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,528
- Why, do you know something about it?  - Well, no.

223
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,152
- But the Inspector Crossland wanted to know...
- All right, Jean. I'll handle this.

224
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:58,656
Ah, take this man away,
put him under lock and key and keep him there!

225
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,320
One step nearer and I'll blow you all to smithereens!

226
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:04,208
Catch!

227
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:11,800
All right, after him!

228
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,550
That's quite clear, is it?
You know what to tell her?

229
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
I do.

230
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:21,488
As soon as you've got rid of the girl, close the kiosk

231
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,360
and get on the next flight.

232
00:17:29,168 --> 00:17:30,640
Miss Briggs.

233
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,700
Yes. Have you found anything?

234
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,973
Err, well yes, I have.

235
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:35,904
But I'm afraid it doesn't help very much.

236
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,512
Your brother definitely did get on our flight to Rome,

237
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,200
but what he did when he got off the plane, I couldn't tell you.

238
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,696
Well, if you can't, who can?

239
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,040
Miss Briggs, We're dealing with
 thousands of passengers every week.

240
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,136
We can't keep track of every single one.

241
00:17:49,328 --> 00:17:51,136
If I were you, I'd go back to Liverpool.

242
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:53,744
I'm sure your brother will turn up eventually.

243
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,704
Now, if you'll excuse me, 
I have to close this kiosk.

244
00:17:57,888 --> 00:17:59,136
Thanks for nothing.

245
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,480
- There's something funny going on here.   - Why?

246
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,104
My brother's vanished, 
and that lot just couldn't care less.

247
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:56,336
Hello? What's the name of the man
 who's in charge of this airport?

248
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,240
The Commandant?

249
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,784
Right, well look, can you put me 
through to his office, please?

250
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:04,192
All right, then Air Traffic Control

251
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:07,616
but I want to speak to a friend of mine 
who should be with the Commandant, right now...

252
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,840
Doctor, I'd like you to meet this young lady.

253
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,900
What young lady? Where's Polly?

254
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,540
She's still inside.

255
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,440
Ah, I shan't be a minute.

256
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,540
Polly...

257
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,360
But why wouldn't you listen to him? It's all true.

258
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:55,744
I'm in the Chameleon Hangar now and I've just f...

259
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,080
Ben!

260
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,576
Ben, can you hear me?

261
00:20:01,904 --> 00:20:03,616
Ben, can you hear me?

262
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,616
Ben, are you all right, can you hear me? Ben!

263
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:17,936
Ben!

264
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:22,784
Ben, can you hear me?

265
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,920
Who is he?

266
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:27,740
A friend of that Doctor on the screen.

267
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,330
Did he see what happened in there?

268
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,670
He must have done.

269
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,056
Then he'll be coming here. 
We'd better be prepared for him.

270
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:37,840
First, dispose of the body.

271
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:43,632
Who is he?

272
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:45,104
His name's Brian Briggs.

273
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,392
Supposed to have come through here 
about a week ago, on holiday.

274
00:20:47,568 --> 00:20:49,310
Thousands of people come through here a week.

275
00:20:49,392 --> 00:20:50,736
Aye, well it was just a chance.

276
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,104
- Do you remember that man? 
- Oh yes, I remember him.

277
00:20:53,248 --> 00:20:55,984
He had a pass. But I can't remember his name.

278
00:20:56,032 --> 00:20:58,704
He's a colleague of mine, Detective Inspector Gascoigne.

279
00:20:58,752 --> 00:21:00,128
Now when did he come back?

280
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,816
I couldn't tell you. There are so many faces.

281
00:21:03,088 --> 00:21:05,840
There was a bit of bother this morning, 
he could have slipped through then.

282
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,976
What sort of bother?

283
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,504
Two people without passports, 
who told some sort of story about a body in a hangar.

284
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,464
- What happened?
- Ah, it was all a hoax.

285
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:17,408
These two men they ran away. 
The airport police are still looking for them!

286
00:21:17,536 --> 00:21:18,848
Can you describe them to me?

287
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:24,800
One was a scruffy-looking man, 
medium-height, wearing a frock-coat,

288
00:21:25,232 --> 00:21:27,520
the other was a Scots boy dressed in a kilt!

289
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,792
Oh, shouldn't be too hard to find.

290
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:38,624
Hey, you think we should go after your friend? 
He's been gone about ten minutes now.

291
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,344
No, he said half a hour. Now, we'll do what he said.

292
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:45,104
Hey, he is a right weirdy, isn't he?

293
00:21:45,248 --> 00:21:48,032
No! I wish I had his brains.

294
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,632
You're all right as you are.

295
00:21:59,216 --> 00:22:04,240
Chameleon Youth Tours announce the departure 
of their flight Number Four-One-Three to Zurich.

296
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:08,416
Will all passengers please assemble in the departure lounge.

297
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:10,080
Chameleon Youth Tours ann...

298
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,448
Hey, look, they've opened up that kiosk now.

299
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:14,208
Aye, and where's Polly?

300
00:22:14,352 --> 00:22:18,416
...Will all passengers please assemble in the departure lounge.

301
00:22:53,152 --> 00:22:54,624
Packing cases!

302
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,072
I'm quite sure the first thing you want to do
 when you get to Switzerland

303
00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:00,520
is write home to your parents...

304
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,356
But in case you don't have time,

305
00:23:02,356 --> 00:23:06,144
Chameleon Tours have some postcards of Zurich 
ready for you to write here.

306
00:23:06,224 --> 00:23:08,288
When you've finished your postcards,

307
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:10,752
give them back to me and we'll post them for you in Zurich.

308
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:13,856
Eh, do you mind?

309
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,200
No, go ahead.

310
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,464
Look! A postcard of Zurich,

311
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,240
stamped with a Swiss stamp, all ready to post.

312
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:23,904
- Well?   - Oh, you're a right one, aren't you.

313
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:26,848
Don't you see. This could explain the card I got from Brian.

314
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:30,580
It was posted in Rome, but that doesn't 
mean to say that he posted it!

315
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,400
Oh I see. We'd better tell the Doctor about this!

316
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,208
Er, how long's he been gone?

317
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:37,680
Err, about half a hour, now.

318
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,776
- Right, I'll go and find him.
- I'll come with you.

319
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:42,592
Just a minute, son. 
I want a word with you.

320
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,952
Somebody, help me... please... 
I'm suffocating...

321
00:23:56,704 --> 00:24:00,496
Quickly, somebody help me please...

322
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,784
I'm suffocating...

323
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:06,444
Help me, please!
