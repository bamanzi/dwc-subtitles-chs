1
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:05,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:50,361
What do we do now?

3
00:00:51,015 --> 00:00:55,299
We slip away and see if we can find all these young people. Come on.

4
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:05,564
Ah, Captain Blade, we're following your instructions, trying to find the accommodation centre.

5
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:11,198
My instructions don't apply to you. You two won't be needing living space.

6
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:24,282
Captain Blade, what is this? I don't understand. We're here to stay, aren't we?

7
00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:27,688
Oh yes, you're here to stay - but not in your present state.

8
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:30,636
I'm very sorry, I simply don't understand what you mean.

9
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:44,173
I checked with the Medical Centre. You're both human. We want you intact. That's why I allowed you to come here. I want your brain.

10
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:56,702
I've told you, I don't know where they are. You're wasting your time with me.

11
00:01:57,656 --> 00:01:59,232
I think he's telling the truth.

12
00:01:59,505 --> 00:02:01,567
I'm afraid he is. Get him out of here!

13
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:06,634
They must be here somewhere.

14
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:19,454
We have completely searched this area. I've now got fifty men going through this part and the Metropolitan Police are sending help. But time is running short. I have to cover the entire airfield. I need volunteers now!

15
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:34,924
Get me the public address room. Heslington, divert all in-bound aircraft. Public Address Room, this is the Commandant. Switch me through to the P.A. system and stop all other announcements until further instructions.

16
00:02:40,114 --> 00:02:42,740
This is the Airport Commandant speaking...

17
00:02:43,416 --> 00:03:04,261
Please pay attention. I want all available Airport personnel to assist in a special duty. Will they please report to the Airport Police, who will issue instructions. I would like to assure passengers that there's no cause for alarm, and to apologise for the temporary suspension of all outward flights.

18
00:03:57,546 --> 00:03:58,226
Oh.

19
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,441
What did you hope to achieve here?

20
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:07,889
A chance to plead with you for the lives of fifty thousand young people.

21
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:09,947
They're only human beings.

22
00:04:10,153 --> 00:04:11,156
And what are you?

23
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:13,269
We are the most intelligent race in the universe.

24
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:14,301
Director?

25
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:15,190
Yes?

26
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,267
Freiburg flight has just taken off.

27
00:04:17,545 --> 00:04:19,023
Why, Jamie!

28
00:04:19,273 --> 00:04:20,443
You wish to speak to me?

29
00:04:20,705 --> 00:04:24,643
Oh no, of course, it's... it's not Jamie. You're a Chameleon.

30
00:04:25,323 --> 00:04:27,274
Well, I don't think you've done a very good job on him.

31
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:28,142
Why not?

32
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:31,939
Well you lost his Scots accent in the processing. Oh I much preferred the original.

33
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:35,258
If you're looking for your friend's original, Doctor, you won't find it in here.

34
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:35,923
Really?

35
00:04:36,113 --> 00:04:36,985
No, it's...

36
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,572
...in a safe place. Not far from here. What are we waiting for?

37
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:44,893
Dubrovnik and Athens. They're waiting to collect our personnel.

38
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:49,428
We're well ahead of schedule. We can wait. Proceed with the processing.

39
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:57,130
By the way Captain Blade, congratulations on bringing this man here. I personally will decide which of our people is to have his identity.

40
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,162
It'll be one of your friends, I've no doubt!

41
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:07,845
Well it's understandable. The... the special people up here feel more secure if their originals are actually in the satellite.

42
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:20,682
And where's yours?

43
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:29,520
That's enough! Their originals are perfectly safe. Hidden on Gatwick Airport, where they will never be found.

44
00:05:46,782 --> 00:05:48,464
What did you mean about our originals?

45
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:55,288
Well, as I see it, there are two categories. People like your Director and that man over there...

46
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:07,643
...whose originals are safe on board here. And then there are people like you two, whose originals have been left behind at Gatwick airport. If they're tampered with... you're finished!

47
00:06:08,432 --> 00:06:12,967
He's lying. Come on, let's get him into the machine before the Director returns.

48
00:06:13,144 --> 00:06:18,179
Yes, you'd better process me quickly, because any minute now you'll cease to exist. You're first on the list!

49
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,205
What list?

50
00:06:21,623 --> 00:06:33,189
Oh surely you understand! We've found all of the originals. The Commandant at the Airport is going to deprocess them one by one, starting with you, unless I stop him.

51
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:35,509
He's bluffing.

52
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,171
Wait! Where did you find the originals?

53
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:49,622
Ah, that I can't tell you. But they'd been searching for some time and just as I was about to board the aircraft I got a signal, which meant that they'd been successful. Otherwise I wouldn't have come.

54
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:55,163
Well, if you don't believe me, check with Gatwick Airport. I imagine you know its radio frequency?

55
00:07:01,532 --> 00:07:04,509
Contact Gatwick Air Control.

56
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:16,608
I've got two dozen men moving down here looking for any signs of the soil having been disturbed. There are twenty men here, with fifty volunteers going through these hangars.

57
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,695
Commandant.

58
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:18,509
Yes.

59
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:19,782
Someone's crashing our frequency.

60
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:20,740
Who is it?

61
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:23,679
I don't know sir. It's an unidentified station, asking for you.

62
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,634
This is Chameleon Headquarters calling Gatwick Airport. How do you read me?

63
00:07:32,616 --> 00:07:36,718
This is Gatwick Airport, Commandant speaking. We are reading you loud and clear.

64
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:42,533
We understand you have found some property in which we have an interest. Will you confirm?

65
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:45,105
Yes, we have that property.

66
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,210
State where you found it.

67
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:54,483
Does that matter. The important thing is we have found it, and can now destroy you.

68
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:56,439
Please stay by your receiver.

69
00:07:57,661 --> 00:07:59,443
The Doctor must be trying some sort of bluff.

70
00:07:59,654 --> 00:08:01,557
And we are not being much help to him.

71
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:11,748
Where d'you think you left them?

72
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:16,486
I don't know, I left them in here somewhere. Anyway, none of that Chameleon lot are looking 'cos they've all gone.

73
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:17,169
Here, look!

74
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:22,020
Yeah. You see it suddenly dawned on me - what would they be doing with so many coaches?

75
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:23,590
Oh, why didn't that occur to me?

76
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:31,346
Oh, you haven't got all the brains in London you know. Twenty-five! There you are, twenty-five car numbers, twenty-five people!

77
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:41,087
This is Chameleon Headquarters. Explain your reluctance to state where you found the property.

78
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,786
It is not a question of reluctance.

79
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:46,896
Say the police haven't told you yet.

80
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:52,669
The property is in the hands of the police, who have not yet informed me where the hiding place was.

81
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:56,976
Message understood. Please stay by your receiver.

82
00:08:57,655 --> 00:08:59,083
I'll get that.

83
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:08,290
Air Traffic Control. Hold on a minute. It's the girl and your assistant. They think they've got a clue.

84
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:11,006
Right, I'll try and stall them.

85
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:15,739
Chameleon Headquarters to Gatwick Airport. We are closing down now.

86
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:19,669
Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Headquarters, are you receiving me?

87
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:28,030
Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Headquarters, are you receiving me? Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Headquarters, are you receiving...

88
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:29,333
Turn it off.

89
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:31,795
Put that gun away.

90
00:09:34,563 --> 00:09:36,599
He said he'd found our originals.

91
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:37,960
And had he?

92
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,118
No, he was bluffing.

93
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:48,192
Proceed with the processing. In future, take your orders only from me.

94
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:52,485
You're going to get a surprise when twenty-five of your people disintegrate!

95
00:09:52,673 --> 00:09:55,637
What a pity you won't be able to see it. The Nurse.

96
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:01,427
Now then, now... what is it you want me to do?

97
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:02,653
Sit down.

98
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:13,131
Tell me, what happens if ah, you disintegrate in the middle of my being processed? I mean, will that do me any harm, being suspended between one thing and an other, so to speak...

99
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:14,449
Sit down!

100
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:17,488
Oh, very well,

101
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,684
Oh dear.

102
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:30,498
You should have been watching him. Send for a new unit. You haven't averted your fate, only postponed it.

103
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,824
At last. Now Doctor...

104
00:10:57,176 --> 00:10:59,194
You're quite sure it's safe now?

105
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,499
Is everything ready now?

106
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:31,897
Just one moment, sir.

107
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:35,484
Director. Gatwick Control calling us again.

108
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:36,817
Ignore them.

109
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:39,518
They claim they have found the originals.

110
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:41,354
They're bluffing again, I said ignore them!

111
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:51,555
Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Head Quarters. Do you read me?

112
00:12:53,894 --> 00:12:55,305
It's no good sir.

113
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:58,746
Very well. We'll have to give them a demonstration.

114
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:00,157
Right Super.

115
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,104
Sergeant Erskine?

116
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:29,868
They have found them! They weren't bluffing.

117
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:31,911
His equipment could have gone wrong.

118
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,056
All right, what could have gone wrong with it?

119
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:36,751
That is a question for our scientists.

120
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:43,213
By the time they tell you that there's nothing wrong with it, you'll all have disintegrated, except of course the Director.

121
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:45,008
Be quiet, this has nothing to do with you.

122
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:48,395
Yes, you're quite right, it only concerns these two. I'll keep my mouth shut.

123
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,986
We'd better contact Gatwick Air Control.

124
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,713
We've finished with Gatwick Airport.

125
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:54,684
And what if they haven't finished with us?

126
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:07,280
That would be your own fault, wouldn't it. You told me that all the originals were hidden. Where they could not possibly be found until the life have been drained from them. Are you now telling me that you were careless?

127
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,901
Contact Gatwick Air Control.

128
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:22,268
Destroy the transmitter.

129
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:25,095
All right.

130
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:34,892
This is Chameleon Head Quarters calling Gatwick Airport. How do you read me?

131
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:42,239
Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Head Quarters. We are reading you loud and clear.

132
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:45,447
Can you now state where you found the originals?

133
00:14:47,488 --> 00:14:55,652
The originals were discovered in a car park. To prove it, we have already eliminated one of your personnel. A man.

134
00:14:56,513 --> 00:15:05,616
I now wish to speak to the Doctor. Unless I hear his voice immediately, the next to be eliminated will be Captain Blade.

135
00:15:07,896 --> 00:15:09,381
Release him!

136
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:13,650
I said release him.

137
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:22,920
Get to that microphone!

138
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:24,760
Release the Nurse first.

139
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:33,211
I said I wished to speak to the Doctor, otherwise the next will be Captain Blade.

140
00:15:33,855 --> 00:15:36,599
Doctor, the microphone.

141
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,907
Are you quite all right, my dear.

142
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:40,183
Yes, I think so.

143
00:15:40,381 --> 00:15:40,951
Good.

144
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:49,338
Commandant, this is the Doctor speaking.

145
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:50,765
Ar, what a relief.

146
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:53,869
Stand by while I negotiate.

147
00:15:55,699 --> 00:16:06,968
Now then, I will tell you my terms. I will guarantee your continued existence, if you will return to Earth all the young people you abducted.

148
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:10,303
No use. They've all been miniaturised.

149
00:16:10,682 --> 00:16:12,049
Then reverse the process.

150
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,985
I'm afraid that's impossible, the equipment for that is on our home planet.

151
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:21,462
He's lying. The planes themselves are the miniaturisation chambers and they work both ways.

152
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:28,936
What kind of continued existence would we have, Doctor?

153
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:35,679
In your former state, I'm afraid. Your scientists will have to find some other way out of your dilemma.

154
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:37,918
It's better than death.

155
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:39,696
We accept.

156
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:43,583
All right, we accept.

157
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,092
You fools, how can you trust him?

158
00:16:49,115 --> 00:16:50,532
Look out! Ahh...

159
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:04,824
Commandant, are you still there?

160
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:05,738
Yes.

161
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:11,253
Negotiations have been successfully concluded as arranged.

162
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:17,043
Good. I'll leave the people in the car park as they are until you arrive back.

163
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:24,696
Good. Please stay listening out on this frequency. I am leaving Captain Blade in charge of the radio.

164
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:25,720
Can you trust him?

165
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,324
Yes, I think I can now.

166
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:28,906
What are you going to do?

167
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:33,083
I'm going to try and find my three friends and the Inspector. You know where they are?

168
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:33,869
Yes.

169
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:36,924
You will take me to them. I will call you again.

170
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:38,209
Roger.

171
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:48,919
Well, Heslington, flap over. Let's get back to normal as quickly as we can.

172
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:55,203
Over here.

173
00:17:55,443 --> 00:17:56,476
I don't know which one.

174
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:00,654
Doctor!

175
00:18:00,986 --> 00:18:03,617
Jamie! Ha, I'm glad to see you alive.

176
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,436
How... how do you mean?

177
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:13,432
I'll explain to you one day. Well come along out. You look like a soldier in a sentry box standing there! Sit down.

178
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:14,721
Sit down.

179
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:17,987
It's all right, he's a friend. Now sit down while I find the others.

180
00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:26,769
Ah! Inspector Crossland.

181
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,986
There we are. Now, Ben, Polly and back to Gatwick.

182
00:18:54,673 --> 00:19:00,538
Doctor, the first plane is ready for take-off. We've got all the processed personnel including your three young friends aboard.

183
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:01,646
Ah, good.

184
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:03,153
Are you going with us, Doctor.

185
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:05,973
Yes, I'm going with Nurse Pinto.

186
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:08,136
Are you going Inspector?

187
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:13,931
No, I think I'd better stay here just for a while, to... tidy things up. Are you ready nurse?

188
00:19:14,124 --> 00:19:15,441
Oh yes, Inspector.

189
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:16,849
I'll see you to the plane.

190
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,871
I'll see you on the plane Nurse.

191
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:25,204
What will our future be Doctor?

192
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:41,048
So long as you keep your side of the bargain, you may return to your own planet unharmed. Perhaps your scientists will be able to find some way out of their dilemma. I may be able to give them one or two ideas of my own.

193
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,701
Yes, yes, I know, all flights were suspended as well as yours.

194
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,283
Hello Doctor. All down safely.

195
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:55,319
Yes. Yes.

196
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:57,789
Splendid, Splendid. I'll take that Brussels call now.

197
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,753
There's just one thing Commandant.

198
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,240
Yes, yes, right.

199
00:20:01,424 --> 00:20:03,816
Our TARDIS. Our police box.

200
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:05,708
Ah Bruxelles. Oui, j'...

201
00:20:05,968 --> 00:20:07,829
The police box on the runway.

202
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:13,326
Of course, Jean, see that the Doctor gets his property back, will you? Goodbye Doctor and thank you so much.

203
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:14,464
Thank you Commandant.

204
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:15,582
Goodbye scottie.

205
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:21,097
Goodbye Samantha. Come along Jamie, we must find Ben and Polly and get to the TARDIS.

206
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:25,703
I'd better say goodbye.

207
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:29,524
Oh, well I'll see you around then?

208
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:30,988
Around where?

209
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:37,011
Well, you know, around... Ah you're not just going off like that?

210
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:42,514
Aye, I must go. The Doctor'll be... Well your brother will be here any moment.

211
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:43,481
Yeah.

212
00:20:45,074 --> 00:20:46,463
Well, ta-ra then!

213
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:51,527
Aye, well can...

214
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:53,811
Hey, thanks for everything.

215
00:20:54,597 --> 00:20:56,258
I'll say goodbye.

216
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:02,150
Goodbye Jamie.

217
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,932
This will do. My thanks to the Commandant.

218
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:17,113
Thank you every much.

219
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:19,431
Hey, Doctor, where are you going?

220
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:20,805
Hey, come back.

221
00:21:35,246 --> 00:21:36,185
Doctor.

222
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,057
What are you doing?

223
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:39,985
Doing. I'm looking for the TARDIS.

224
00:21:40,185 --> 00:21:43,817
Oh no, can't we stay in London a bit?

225
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:45,782
Yeah, it's good to feel normal again.

226
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:47,680
Normal? What do you mean, Ben?

227
00:21:47,854 --> 00:21:51,999
Well, no monsters, or Cybermen. All this - it's normal. I understand it.

228
00:21:52,202 --> 00:21:55,211
Do you? What about Chameleon Tours?

229
00:21:55,612 --> 00:21:57,259
Oh yeah, that was different!

230
00:21:57,428 --> 00:22:02,397
Oh I'll be glad to get away from here. Can you not land us in a nice civilised place like 1750?

231
00:22:02,598 --> 00:22:05,147
What's so uncivilised about 1966?

232
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:06,310
Oh, you can keep it!

233
00:22:06,878 --> 00:22:09,204
Did you say 1966.

234
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:09,962
Yes.

235
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:11,175
What month is it?

236
00:22:11,453 --> 00:22:14,799
It's July. July the 20th, to be precise.

237
00:22:15,232 --> 00:22:17,237
What are you getting at?

238
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:25,552
Don't you see, Duchess? July the 20th, 1966 is when it all began! We're back to when it all started! Well, I think...

239
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:29,372
That means it's as... it's as if we've never been away!

240
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,256
You really want to go, don't you.

241
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:36,945
Well, we won't leave, Doctor, if you really need us.

242
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:43,356
The thing is, it... it is our world.

243
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:48,526
Yes, I know. You're lucky, I never got back to mine...

244
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,878
All right, then. Off you go!

245
00:22:54,927 --> 00:23:01,661
Now go on, Ben can catch his ship and become an Admiral and you Polly, you can look after Ben.

246
00:23:03,012 --> 00:23:04,146
I will.

247
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:08,769
You will be safe, won't you?

248
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:10,419
I'll look after him.

249
00:23:10,814 --> 00:23:12,363
I'm sure you will, mate.

250
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:15,216
Goodbye Doctor.

251
00:23:15,766 --> 00:23:16,149
Ben.

252
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,874
We might see you sometime. Take care.

253
00:23:19,821 --> 00:23:22,183
Well you'd better hurry. The Commandant's car's waiting.

254
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:36,463
I'm sad to see them go.

255
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,825
Yes Jamie, so am I.

256
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,909
Well, we've got things to do.

257
00:23:44,746 --> 00:23:45,595
What things?

258
00:23:45,814 --> 00:23:49,306
Well, I didn't tell the others but... we've lost the TARDIS!

259
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:50,451
We can't have done.

260
00:23:50,718 --> 00:23:52,171
It was outside - it's not there now.

261
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:53,962
You mean somebody's stolen it?

262
00:23:54,145 --> 00:23:57,495
I don't know, but that's what we're going to find out! Come on!
