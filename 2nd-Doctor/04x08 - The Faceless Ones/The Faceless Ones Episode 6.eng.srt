1
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:05,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:34,896
What do we do now?

3
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,416
We slip away and see if we can find all these young people. Come on.

4
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,656
Ah, Captain Blade, we're following your instructions,

5
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:47,088
We're looking for the accommodation centre.

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,552
My instructions don't apply to you.

7
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,216
You two won't be needing living space.

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,744
Captain Blade, what is this?

9
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:04,656
I don't understand. We're here to stay, aren't we?

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,048
Oh yes, you're here to stay - but not in your present state.

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,730
I'm very sorry, I simply don't understand what you mean.

12
00:01:10,848 --> 00:01:14,800
I checked with the Medical Centre. You're both human.

13
00:01:16,448 --> 00:01:22,608
We want you intact. That's why I allowed you to come here. I want your brain.

14
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,360
I've told you, I don't know where they are.

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,088
You're wasting your time with me.

16
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:37,360
I think he's telling the truth.

17
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:39,680
I'm afraid he is. Get him out of here!

18
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,048
They must be here somewhere.

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,016
We have completely searched this area.

20
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:50,096
I've now got fifty men going through this part
 and the Metropolitan Police are sending help.

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,536
But time is running short. I have to cover the entire airfield.

22
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,980
I need volunteers now!

23
00:01:58,128 --> 00:01:59,952
Get me the public address room.

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,280
Heslington, divert all in-bound aircraft.

25
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,000
Public Address Room, this is the Commandant.

26
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:07,688
Switch me through to the P.A. system 

27
00:02:07,696 --> 00:02:10,320
and stop all other announcements until further instructions.

28
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,720
This is the Airport Commandant speaking...

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,888
Please pay attention.

30
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:24,192
I want all available Airport personnel to assist in a special duty.

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,072
Will they please report to the Airport Police, who will issue instructions.

32
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:33,456
I would like to assure passengers that there's no cause for alarm,

33
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,872
and to apologise for the temporary suspension of all outward flights.

34
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh.

35
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,224
What did you hope to achieve here?

36
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:37,312
A chance to plead with you 
for the lives of fifty thousand young people.

37
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,656
They're only human beings.

38
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,240
And what are you?

39
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,416
We are the most intelligent race in the universe.

40
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,904
- Director?  - Yes?

41
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
Freiburg flight has just taken off.

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,776
Why, Jamie!

43
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:49,840
- You wish to speak to me?  - Oh no, of course

44
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,912
It's... it's not Jamie. You're a Chameleon.

45
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,032
- Well, I don't think you've done a very good job on him.  - Why not?

46
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:58,080
Well you lost his Scots accent in the processing.

47
00:03:58,128 --> 00:03:59,408
Oh I much preferred the original.

48
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:03,104
If you're looking for your friend's original, Doctor, you won't find it in here.

49
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:04,400
- Really?  - No, it's...

50
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,448
...in a safe place.

51
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:08,928
Not far from here. What are we waiting for?

52
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:12,176
Dubrovnik and Athens. They're waiting to collect our personnel.

53
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,176
We're well ahead of schedule. We can wait.

54
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:16,448
Proceed with the processing.

55
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:20,208
By the way Captain Blade, congratulations on bringing this man here.

56
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,552
I personally will decide which of our people is to have his identity.

57
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:26,496
It'll be one of your friends, I've no doubt!

58
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,936
Well it's understandable. The... the special people up here...

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,520
feel more secure if their originals are actually in the satellite.

60
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:36,752
- Be quiet.
 - The Director has nothing to worry about

61
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:40,800
because his original, Detective Inspector Crossland is actually on board.

62
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,032
But where's your original?

63
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,480
And where's yours?

64
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,296
That's enough! Their originals are perfectly safe.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,600
Hidden on Gatwick Airport, where they will never be found.

66
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,616
What did you mean about our originals?

67
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:14,680
Well, as I see it, there are two categories.

68
00:05:14,944 --> 00:05:18,272
People like your Director and that man over there...

69
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,800
...whose originals are safe on board here.

70
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,432
And then there are people like you two,

71
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,728
whose originals have been left behind at Gatwick airport.

72
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,488
If they're tampered with... you're finished!

73
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,488
He's lying.

74
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,570
Come on, let's get him into the machine before the Director returns.

75
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,416
Yes, you'd better process me quickly,

76
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:39,536
because any minute now you'll cease to exist. You're first on the list!

77
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:44,048
- What list?  - Oh surely you understand! 

78
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,928
We've found all of the originals.

79
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,800
The Commandant at the Airport is going to deprocess them one by one,

80
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,990
starting with you, unless I stop him.

81
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,400
- He's bluffing.  - Wait!

82
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:59,440
- Where did you find the originals?
- Ah, that I can't tell you. 

83
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,696
But they'd been searching for some time 

84
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,496
and just as I was about to board the aircraft I got a signal,

85
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,416
which meant that they'd been successful.

86
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:08,840
Otherwise I wouldn't have come.

87
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,064
Well, if you don't believe me, check with Gatwick Airport.

88
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:14,200
I imagine you know its radio frequency?

89
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,544
Contact Gatwick Air Control.

90
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,802
I've got two dozen men moving down here 

91
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,320
looking for any signs of the soil having been disturbed.

92
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,208
There are twenty men here, with fifty volunteers going through these hangars.

93
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:35,440
- Commandant.  - Yes?

94
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:36,944
Someone's crashing our frequency.

95
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:38,256
- Who is it?  - I don't know sir.

96
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:40,688
 It's an unidentified station, asking for you.

97
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,952
This is Chameleon Headquarters calling Gatwick Airport.

98
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:45,800
How do you read me?

99
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,456
This is Gatwick Airport, Commandant speaking.

100
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:53,500
We are reading you loud and clear.

101
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,152
We understand you have found some property in which we have an interest.

102
00:06:57,344 --> 00:07:01,400
-  Will you confirm? - Yes, we have that property.

103
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,104
- State where you found it.  - Does that matter?

104
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:09,472
The important thing is we have found it, and can now destroy you.

105
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:11,680
Please stay by your receiver.

106
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:14,384
The Doctor must be trying some sort of bluff.

107
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:16,384
And we are not being much help to him.

108
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,360
- Where d'you think you left them?  
- I don't know, I left them in here somewhere. 

109
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:30,944
Anyway, none of that Chameleon lot are looking 'cos they've all gone.

110
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,728
Here, look!

111
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,448
Yeah. You see it suddenly dawned on me -

112
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:36,220
what would they be doing with so many coaches?

113
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:37,376
Why didn't that occur to me?

114
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,952
Oh, you haven't got all the brains in London you know.

115
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:45,120
Twenty-five! There you are, twenty-five car numbers, twenty-five people!

116
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,048
This is Chameleon Headquarters.

117
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,680
Explain your reluctance to state where you found the property.

118
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,380
It is not a question of reluctance.

119
00:07:56,992 --> 00:07:59,136
Say the police haven't told you yet.

120
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,648
The property is in the hands of the police,

121
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:04,680
who have not yet informed me where the hiding place was.

122
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:08,448
Message understood. Please stay by your receiver.

123
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,368
I'll get that.

124
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,472
Air Traffic Control. Hold on a minute.

125
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,344
It's the girl and your assistant. They think they've got a clue.

126
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:21,936
Right, I'll try and stall them.

127
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:26,224
Chameleon Headquarters to Gatwick Airport. We are closing down now.

128
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:30,288
Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Headquarters, are you receiving me?

129
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,432
Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Headquarters, are you receiving me?

130
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,192
- Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Headquarters...  - Turn it off.

131
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:41,152
Put that gun away.

132
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,720
- He said he'd found our originals.  - And had he?

133
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:49,152
No, he was bluffing.

134
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,896
Proceed with the processing.

135
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,072
In future, take your orders only from me.

136
00:08:57,696 --> 00:09:00,976
You're going to get a surprise when twenty-five of your people disintegrate!

137
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,768
What a pity you won't be able to see it.

138
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:03,936
The Nurse.

139
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,264
Now then, now... what is it you want me to do?

140
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,816
- Sit down.  - Tell me...

141
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,816
what happens if ah, you disintegrate in the middle of my being processed?

142
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,382
I mean, will that do me any harm,

143
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:20,480
being suspended between one thing and an other, so to speak...

144
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:21,760
Sit down! 

145
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,280
Oh dear.

146
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:27,952
You should have been watching him.

147
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:30,752
Send for a new unit.

148
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:37,072
You haven't averted your fate, only postponed it.

149
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:01,136
At last. Now Doctor...

150
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,040
You're quite sure it's safe now?

151
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,540
Is everything ready now?

152
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:26,816
Just one moment, sir.

153
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:30,112
Director. Gatwick Control calling us again.

154
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,536
- Ignore them.  - They claim they have found the originals.

155
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,016
They're bluffing again, I said ignore them!

156
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,664
Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Head Quarters. Do you read me?

157
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,940
It's no good sir.

158
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:52,144
Very well. We'll have to give them a demonstration.

159
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,632
Right Super.

160
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:55,520
Sergeant Erskine?

161
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,200
They have found them! They weren't bluffing.

162
00:12:21,776 --> 00:12:23,344
His equipment could have gone wrong.

163
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:26,256
All right, what could have gone wrong with it?

164
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,840
That is a question for our scientists.

165
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,992
By the time they tell you that there's nothing wrong with it,

166
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:34,080
you'll all have disintegrated, except of course the Director.

167
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:35,760
Be quiet, this has nothing to do with you.

168
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Yes, you're quite right, it only concerns these two. I'll keep my mouth shut.

169
00:12:39,088 --> 00:12:41,216
We'd better contact Gatwick Air Control.

170
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,768
We've finished with Gatwick Airport.

171
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,768
And what if they haven't finished with us?

172
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,648
That would be your own fault, wouldn't it.

173
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:50,704
You told me that all the originals were hidden.

174
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:54,416
Where they could not possibly be found until the life have been drained from them.

175
00:12:54,912 --> 00:12:56,880
Are you now telling me that you were careless?

176
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,312
Contact Gatwick Air Control.

177
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:10,770
Destroy the transmitter.

178
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:13,600
All right.

179
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,328
This is Chameleon Head Quarters calling Gatwick Airport.

180
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:23,020
How do you read me?

181
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,424
Gatwick Airport to Chameleon Head Quarters.

182
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:29,328
We are reading you loud and clear.

183
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:32,864
Can you now state where you found the originals?

184
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:37,456
The originals were discovered in a car park.

185
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:42,144
To prove it, we have already eliminated one of your personnel. A man.

186
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,472
I now wish to speak to the Doctor.

187
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,160
Unless I hear his voice immediately,

188
00:13:48,512 --> 00:13:51,584
the next to be eliminated will be Captain Blade.

189
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,976
Release him!

190
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:58,784
I said release him.

191
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:07,664
Get to that microphone!

192
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,504
Release the Nurse first.

193
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:14,448
I said I wished to speak to the Doctor,

194
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:17,710
otherwise the next will be Captain Blade.

195
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,270
Doctor, the microphone.

196
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,040
Are you quite all right, my dear.

197
00:14:23,104 --> 00:14:24,944
- Yes, I think so.   - Good.

198
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:33,000
Commandant, this is the Doctor speaking.

199
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:34,544
Ar, what a relief.

200
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:37,530
Stand by while I negotiate.

201
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:41,907
Now then, I will tell you my terms.

202
00:14:42,736 --> 00:14:45,824
I will guarantee your continued existence,

203
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,728
if you will return to Earth all the young people you abducted.

204
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:52,784
No use. They've all been miniaturised.

205
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,648
- Then reverse the process.  - I'm afraid that's impossible,

206
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:59,008
The equipment for that is on our home planet.  - He's lying. 

207
00:14:59,152 --> 00:15:03,104
The planes themselves are the miniaturisation chambers and they work both ways.

208
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,390
What kind of continued existence would we have, Doctor?

209
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,816
In your former state, I'm afraid.

210
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,576
Your scientists will have to find some other way out of your dilemma.

211
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,816
It's better than death.

212
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:20,528
We accept.

213
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:24,176
All right, we accept.

214
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:27,216
You fools, how can you trust him?

215
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:30,736
Look out! Ahh...

216
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,040
- Commandant, are you still there?  - Yes.

217
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:50,048
Negotiations have been successfully concluded as arranged.

218
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,440
Good. I'll leave the people in the car park as they are until you arrive back.

219
00:15:56,096 --> 00:16:00,020
Good. Please stay listening out on this frequency.

220
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:02,688
I am leaving Captain Blade in charge of the radio.

221
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:04,928
- Can you trust him? - Yes, I think I can now.

222
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:06,528
What are you going to do?

223
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:09,792
I'm going to try and find my three friends and the Inspector.

224
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,088
- You know where they are?  - Yes.

225
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:13,840
You will take me to them. I will call you again.

226
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,696
Roger.

227
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,720
Well, Heslington, flap over.

228
00:16:22,992 --> 00:16:25,440
Let's get back to normal as quickly as we can.

229
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,560
Over here. I don't know which one.

230
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:37,728
- Doctor!  - Jamie! Ha!

231
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:39,632
I'm glad to see you alive.

232
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,024
How... how do you mean?

233
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,672
I'll explain to you one day. Well come along out.

234
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:47,584
You look like a soldier in a sentry box standing there!

235
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:48,912
Sit down.

236
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:50,912
It's all right, he's a friend.

237
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,056
Now sit down while I find the others.

238
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,328
Ah! Inspector Crossland. There we are. 

239
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:07,760
Now, Ben, Polly and back to Gatwick.

240
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,529
Doctor, the first plane is ready for take-off.

241
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,848
We've got all the processed personnel including your three young friends aboard.

242
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:33,936
Ah, good.

243
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:35,328
Are you going with us, Doctor.

244
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:38,080
Yes, I'm going with Nurse Pinto.

245
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:40,208
Are you going Inspector?

246
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,480
No, I think I'd better stay here just for a while, to... tidy things up.

247
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:46,976
- Are you ready nurse?   - Oh yes, Inspector.

248
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,808
- I'll see you to the plane.  - I'll see you on the plane Nurse.

249
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,110
What will our future be Doctor?

250
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,731
So long as you keep your side of the bargain,

251
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:02,384
you may return to your own planet unharmed.

252
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,688
Perhaps your scientists will be able to find some way out of their dilemma.

253
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:11,296
I may be able to give them one or two ideas of my own.

254
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,024
Yes, yes, I know, all flights were suspended as well as yours.

255
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:24,464
- Hello Doctor. All down safely.  - Yes, yes.

256
00:18:24,496 --> 00:18:27,040
Splendid, Splendid. I'll take that Brussels call now.

257
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,176
- There's just one thing Commandant.   - Yes, yes, right.

258
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,736
Our TARDIS. Our police box.

259
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,416
Ah Bruxelles. Oui, j'...

260
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:36,336
The police box on the runway.

261
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,840
Of course, Jean, see that the Doctor gets his property back, will you?

262
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:41,744
Goodbye Doctor and thank you so much.

263
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:44,160
Thank you Commandant. Goodbye scottie.

264
00:18:44,544 --> 00:18:45,856
Goodbye Samantha.

265
00:18:46,112 --> 00:18:48,980
Come along Jamie, we must find Ben and Polly and get to the TARDIS.

266
00:18:51,728 --> 00:18:53,200
I'd better say goodbye.

267
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:56,464
Oh, well I'll see you around then?

268
00:18:56,656 --> 00:18:58,256
Around where?

269
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,912
Well, you know, around...

270
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,648
Ah you're not just going off like that?

271
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,496
Aye, I must go. The Doctor'll be...

272
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:09,824
Well your brother will be here any moment.

273
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:12,864
Well, ta-ra then!

274
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,792
Hey, thanks for everything.

275
00:19:20,304 --> 00:19:21,744
I'll say goodbye.

276
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:27,904
Goodbye Jamie.

277
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,600
This will do. My thanks to the Commandant.

278
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,780
Thank you every much.

279
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:43,632
Hey, Doctor, where are you going?

280
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,280
Hey, come back.

281
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,888
Doctor.

282
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,472
What are you doing?

283
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,760
Doing. I'm looking for the TARDIS, of course.

284
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:06,912
Oh no, can't we stay in London a bit?

285
00:20:06,976 --> 00:20:08,832
Yeah, it's good to feel normal again.

286
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:10,064
Normal? What do you mean, Ben?

287
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,384
Well, no monsters, or Cybermen.

288
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:14,512
All this - it's normal. I understand it.

289
00:20:14,608 --> 00:20:17,936
Do you? What about Chameleon Tours?

290
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:19,120
Oh yeah, that was different!

291
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,088
Oh I'll be glad to get away from here.

292
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,368
Can you not land us in a nice civilised place like 1750?

293
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,990
What's so uncivilised about 1966?

294
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,160
Oh, you can keep it!

295
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,376
- Did you say 1966.  - Yes.

296
00:20:31,504 --> 00:20:32,496
What month is it?

297
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:36,192
It's July. July the 20th, to be precise.

298
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,368
What are you getting at?

299
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:43,136
Don't you see, Duchess? 
July the 20th, 1966 is when it all began!

300
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,448
We're back to when it all started! Well, I think...

301
00:20:46,768 --> 00:20:50,320
That means it's as... it's as if we've never been away!

302
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:52,896
You really want to go, don't you.

303
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:57,088
Well, we won't leave, Doctor, if you really need us.

304
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:02,960
The thing is, it... it is our world.

305
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,512
Yes, I know.

306
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:08,110
You're lucky, I never got back to mine...

307
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:13,300
All right, then. Off you go!

308
00:21:13,952 --> 00:21:18,172
Now go on, Ben can catch his ship and become an Admiral

309
00:21:18,368 --> 00:21:20,208
and you Polly, you can look after Ben.

310
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:22,912
I will.

311
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,832
You will be safe, won't you?

312
00:21:27,104 --> 00:21:30,144
- I'll look after him.  - I'm sure you will, mate.

313
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:33,648
Goodbye Doctor.

314
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,784
We might see you sometime. Take care.

315
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,712
Well you'd better hurry. The Commandant's car's waiting.

316
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,960
I'm sad to see them go.

317
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:55,136
Yes Jamie, so am I.

318
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,464
Well, we've got things to do.

319
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,328
- What things?  - Well, I didn't tell the others but...

320
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,136
We've lost the TARDIS!

321
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:06,432
We can't have done.

322
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,192
It was outside - it's not there now.

323
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,656
- You mean somebody's stolen it?  - I don't know, 

324
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:13,504
But that's what we're going to find out! Come on!
