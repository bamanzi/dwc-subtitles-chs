1
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:58,961
You know, I can't tell you how much
I was looking forward to this reunion.

2
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:02,119
A chance of re-meeting old friends.

3
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:04,277
There was one chap
we tried to get hold of.

4
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:07,598
What was his name?
Used to be your scientific advisor.

5
00:01:07,687 --> 00:01:09,757
-Oh, the Doctor.
-Yes, that's right.

6
00:01:09,847 --> 00:01:12,486
Wonderful chap. All of them.

7
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:14,922
Them?

8
00:01:19,727 --> 00:01:21,046
Yes?

9
00:01:21,127 --> 00:01:23,721
<i>Excuse me, sir,
sorry to interrupt. Someone's arrived.</i>

10
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:25,160
I'm not expecting anyone.

11
00:01:25,247 --> 00:01:27,920
Insists on seeing
Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart.

12
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:29,918
<i>How did he know he was here?</i>

13
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,804
I'm sorry, sir,
you're not allowed in there.

14
00:01:31,887 --> 00:01:34,640
Not allowed? Me? I'm allowed everywhere.

15
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:38,442
Oh, thank you. Brigadier.

16
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:42,560
Good heavens, is it you?

17
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:47,277
Yes, yes. For once, I was able
to steer the Tardis and here I am.

18
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:49,198
-Oh, it's all right, Sergeant.
-Very good, sir.

19
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:51,642
-I'm not too late, am I?
-What for?

20
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:54,082
For your speech, as guest of honour.

21
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:56,362
<i>-How did you know?
-I saw it in the Times.</i>

22
00:01:56,447 --> 00:01:59,723
That's impossible.
The reporter's still here.

23
00:01:59,807 --> 00:02:01,445
<i>Tomorrow's Times.</i>

24
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:04,477
And who is this?

25
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:06,523
That's Colonel Crichton, my replacement.

26
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:10,600
Ah. Yes, mine was
pretty unpromising, too.

27
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:16,396
Come along, Doctor. We'll take a stroll
round the grounds, shall we?

28
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:18,557
Awfully sorry about this.
Do excuse me for a moment.

29
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:20,717
You've had this place redecorated,
haven't you?

30
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,002
-Hmm. Don't like it.
-Come on, Doctor.

31
00:02:23,087 --> 00:02:24,600
-After you.
-What?

32
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:26,200
-After you.
-Oh.

33
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:42,762
Everything all right, sir?

34
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:46,086
What the blazes is going on?

35
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,237
Who was that strange little man?

36
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:51,160
-The Doctor.
-Who?

37
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:58,236
Yes, Yeti, Cybermen,
we've seen some times, Doctor.

38
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:01,682
And Omega, don't forget Omega.

39
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:05,396
-As if I could!
-And the terrible Zodin.

40
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:06,556
Who?

41
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:09,241
Oh, you weren't concerned with her,
were you?

42
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:12,046
No. She happened in the future.

43
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:16,325
They were covered in hair,
and used to hop like kangaroos.

44
00:03:16,407 --> 00:03:19,319
Well, I must say goodbye, Brigadier.

45
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,284
I really shouldn't be here at all.

46
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,918
I'm not exactly breaking the laws
of time, but I am bending them a little.

47
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,316
You never did bother much about rules,
as I remember.

48
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:32,519
What's the matter?

49
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:35,166
What is it?

50
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:39,559
Brigadier, I think our past
is catching up on us.

51
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:42,605
Or maybe it's our future. Come on, run!

52
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:47,005
Doctor, I'm too old
for this sort of thing.

53
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:48,281
Where's it gone?

54
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:51,803
We must get back to the Tardis
before it's too late.

55
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:53,002
Run!

56
00:04:18,747 --> 00:04:20,260
Charming spot, Doctor.

57
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:23,145
My dear Brigadier,
it's no use blaming me.

58
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:33,301
You attract trouble, Doctor.
You always did.

59
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:36,424
-Where the devil are we?
-I'm not sure.

60
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:39,226
But I have some very nasty suspicions.

61
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:42,379
-What's that?
-Eh?

62
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:44,139
Over there.

63
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,201
Get down.

64
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,915
Don't worry, Brigadier.

65
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:03,882
Run!

66
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:14,938
Great balls of fire!

67
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:35,585
Good old Bessie.

68
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:52,085
It's just as I feared.
We're on Gallifrey, in the Death Zone.

69
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:55,555
-You know this place?
-To my shame.

70
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,361
Yes, mine, Brigadier,
and that of every other Time Lord.

71
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,599
In the days before Rassilon,
my ancestors had tremendous powers,

72
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:06,917
which they misused disgracefully.

73
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:09,237
They set up this place, the Death Zone,

74
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,637
and walled it around
with an impenetrable force field.

75
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:15,446
And then they kidnapped other beings
and set them down here.

76
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:18,121
-But what for?
-I'll explain as we go.

77
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:21,756
-Where are we going?
-To the Tower. To Rassilon.

78
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:26,316
The greatest single figure
in Time Lord history.

79
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:30,286
-Is that where he lives?
-Not exactly, Brigadier. It's his tomb.

80
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:37,656
I wonder, could Rassilon himself
have brought us here?

81
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:43,065
Hang on a minute, Doctor.
You said this chap Rassilon was dead.

82
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:45,980
-You did say that was his tomb?
-Oh, it is.

83
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:50,178
But no one really knows
how extensive his powers were.

84
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,939
He could still be alive?

85
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:54,541
Watching us at this very moment.

86
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:57,095
Didn't you say he was supposed
to be rather a good type?

87
00:06:57,187 --> 00:06:58,984
So the official history says.

88
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:02,025
But there are many rumours
and legends to the contrary.

89
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:05,941
Some say his fellow Time Lords
rebelled against his cruelty

90
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:08,336
and locked him in the Tower
in eternal sleep.

91
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:13,182
-And now he's woken up again?
-Well, it would explain a great deal.

92
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,417
-Oh, dear.
-Mmm?

93
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:19,546
We could be playing the Game of Rassilon
at this very moment.

94
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:22,266
Your tone doesn't inspire
much confidence.

95
00:07:22,347 --> 00:07:24,815
I assume we're not expected to win?

96
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:30,021
Come on.

97
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:48,543
# To Rassilon's Tower would go

98
00:07:48,627 --> 00:07:49,696
# Must choose...

99
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:50,776
No, no, no.

100
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:53,222
# Who unto to Rassilon's Tower would go

101
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,821
# Must choose above, between, below #

102
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:57,386
You in pain, Doctor?

103
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:00,379
Age has not mellowed you,
has it, Brigadier?

104
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:02,935
I was recalling, in point of fact,
an old nursery rhyme

105
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:04,062
about the Dark Tower.

106
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:07,059
-Does it help?
-Considerably more than you do.

107
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:10,184
It describes the different ways
to enter the Tower.

108
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:14,385
A nursery rhyme?
I've never heard anything so ridiculous.

109
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:17,459
Nevertheless,
I propose to put it to the test.

110
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,100
Come along.

111
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:37,939
We should be at the Tower very soon.
The tunnel's rising all the time.

112
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:40,700
Is that supposed to cheer me up?

113
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:44,061
What was that?

114
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:46,422
It sounded like something very large
and very fierce,

115
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:47,986
and probably very hungry.

116
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,420
Come on.

117
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:54,457
Whatever that creature is,
it's got our scent.

118
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:56,219
It's hunting us!

119
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:07,905
In here.

120
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,503
Doctor, look!

121
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,586
Trapped!

122
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:32,986
Hold this.

123
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:43,144
Oh, hurry up, Doctor,
it's trying to dig us out!

124
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:04,015
-What was that?
-Pardon?

125
00:10:04,107 --> 00:10:07,224
-What was that?
-It's a Galactic Glitter.

126
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:13,423
-It's a Yeti!
-Where did it come from?

127
00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:15,179
It must have been left over
from the Games.

128
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:18,105
You maddened it!

129
00:10:24,947 --> 00:10:29,145
-Well, at least it can't get at us.
-Yes, and now we're trapped.

130
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:31,866
-Buried alive.
-Yes, I'm afraid we are.

131
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,061
On the other hand,

132
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:39,821
where there's a wind, there's a way.

133
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,361
Well, I think we've arrived.

134
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:14,857
I don't like this at all.

135
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:18,323
Someone or something
wants us to go inside.

136
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,278
After you, Brigadier.

137
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,437
No, no, after you, Doctor.

138
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:40,924
I don't like it, Doctor.
I feel rather unwell, touch of nausea.

139
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:45,444
What you feel is fear, Brigadier,
projecting from the mind of Rassilon.

140
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:46,642
Fear?

141
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:53,279
Doctor! Help me!
-No! It may be a trap.

142
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:57,284
-I'll go and see. You wait here.
-Certainly not. I'm coming with you.

143
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,165
Oh, very well. But don't get in the way!

144
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:11,118
Take this.

145
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:17,167
-What was that?
-We'll go and see.

146
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:27,442
-Good grief!
-Jamie! Zoe!

147
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:30,246
-Stay back, Doctor!
-Why, what's happening?

148
00:12:30,327 --> 00:12:33,205
Don't come any closer.
There's a force field.

149
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:36,723
A force field?
We'll soon see about that.

150
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:40,641
No, don't, Doctor! If the force field
is disturbed, it'll destroy us!

151
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:43,195
-You must go back!
-Well, Doctor, what are we going to do?

152
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:45,084
-Get them out of it!
-No, no, please don't, Doctor!

153
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,476
Oh, go back. Save yourselves.

154
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,797
-I can't! I can't leave you there!
-You must!

155
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:51,684
We could find another way
into the Tomb area.

156
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:54,235
But Zoe and Jamie
would still be trapped!

157
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:57,125
-The Brigadier's right!
-Or would they?

158
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:00,446
Just a minute.

159
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:04,243
It's a matter of memory.

160
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:10,360
-Stay away!
-Why? I can't harm you.

161
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:13,917
-But one step nearer and we're dead!
-You can't kill illusions.

162
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:17,283
- But, Brigadier...
-You're not real.

163
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:20,443
When you were returned
to your own people,

164
00:13:20,527 --> 00:13:24,122
the Time Lords erased your memory
of the period you spent with me.

165
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:27,358
So, how do you know who we are? Answer!

166
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:39,475
-They're gone.
-Yes, yes, it's sad.

167
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:45,636
I still don't like it, Doctor.
I don't fully understand why we're here.

168
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:47,285
-You want to get home?
-Of course.

169
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:51,485
That is why we are here.
Have faith, Brigadier.

170
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:55,242
-Have I ever led you astray?
-On many occasions.

171
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,922
Yes, well, this will be the exception.
Come along.

172
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:12,517
-Hmm, fascinating.
-What's happened to the little fellow?

173
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:16,600
The little fellow is perfectly
all right, thank you very much.

174
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:19,884
Of course I'm here!

175
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:23,277
You don't imagine anything
you two can do would stump me, do you?

176
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:26,200
-Let's have a look. What's this?
Brigadier?

177
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:27,402
Good heavens!

178
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:32,082
It's Miss Smith, isn't it?
And Miss Jovanka.

179
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:36,743
Lethbridge-Stewart? Oh, my dear fellow,
how very nice to see you again.

180
00:14:36,827 --> 00:14:38,704
-Great heavens, you as well.
-Yes.

181
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:41,620
Though I can't exactly say it's nice to
be here. Do you know, I was enjoying...

182
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:42,935
You'll have to excuse me, old chap.

183
00:14:43,027 --> 00:14:45,018
We have a very important inscription
to translate

184
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:48,986
and I think they'll get it all wrong
without me. Move.

185
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:55,180
-Typical. Absolutely typical.
-Oh, I know, I know.

186
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:57,781
Drag you through time and space
without so much as a by-your-leave,

187
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:59,664
then leave you out
when things get interesting.

188
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:03,262
-My version isn't any better.
-Well, which one's yours?

189
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:09,095
So, that's what it's all about.
I never dreamed...

190
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:12,145
It changes nothing, absolutely nothing.

191
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:14,866
We lower the force field,
get the young fellow back from Gallifrey

192
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:20,305
and all go home.
This doesn't concern us, it mustn't.

193
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:23,424
-What does the inscription say?
-Yes, I'd quite like to know as well.

194
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:25,577
Yes, we've all been through
a great deal to get here.

195
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,419
You. Tell them.

196
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:32,980
It's Old High Gallifreyan,
the ancient language of the Time Lords.

197
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,705
Not many people understand it
these days...

198
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:36,140
Fortunately, I do.

199
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:40,140
All very interesting, I'm sure, Doctors,
but what does it say?

200
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:45,620
That this is the Tomb of Rassilon,
where Rassilon lies in eternal sleep.

201
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:48,426
It also says
that anyone who has got this far

202
00:15:48,507 --> 00:15:53,262
has passed a number of dangers and
shown great courage and determination.

203
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:54,700
What does this bit mean?

204
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,665
To lose is to win,
and he who wins shall lose.

205
00:15:57,747 --> 00:15:58,816
I know what it says. What does it mean?

206
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:02,662
It also promises that whoever takes
the ring from Rassilon's hand

207
00:16:02,747 --> 00:16:06,103
and puts it on
shall get the reward he seeks.

208
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:08,303
-What reward?
-Immortality.

209
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:12,380
-What, live forever? Never die?
-That is what the word means, young man.

210
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,822
-But that's impossible.
-Apparently not.

211
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,501
It seems Rassilon possesses it now

212
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:20,545
and is willing to share it
with whoever takes the ring.

213
00:16:20,627 --> 00:16:24,461
Thank you, gentlemen,
that is exactly what I needed to know.

214
00:16:25,707 --> 00:16:29,495
I came here to help you,
a little unwillingly, but I came.

215
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:32,818
My services were scorned,
my help refused.

216
00:16:32,907 --> 00:16:37,822
Now, I shall help myself to immortality.

217
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:39,022
Out of the question.

218
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:40,540
You're hardly a suitable candidate.

219
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:41,855
For anything.

220
00:16:44,947 --> 00:16:47,256
The decision is scarcely yours.

221
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:51,507
Killing you once
was never enough for me, Doctor.

222
00:16:51,587 --> 00:16:55,500
How gratifying to do it
three times over!

223
00:16:55,587 --> 00:16:56,861
Nice to see you again.

224
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:05,944
I've reversed the polarity
of the neutron flow

225
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:08,336
so the Tardis should be free
of the force field now.

226
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,146
I'll try to get through to the Capitol.

227
00:17:21,827 --> 00:17:24,660
<i>Can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Doctor?</i>

228
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:31,977
<i>Calling the Capitol,
calling the Capitol.</i>

229
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:35,784
<i>This is the Doctor speaking.
Well, one of them.</i>

230
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:39,056
<i>Can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Doctor?</i>

231
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:44,865
<i>Is there anybody there?
Calling the Capitol.</i>

232
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:49,579
<i>-Yes, I'm here.
-Ah, there I am. I mean, there you are.</i>

233
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:52,696
We've reached the Tower, we're all safe,

234
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:55,096
the barriers are down
and the Tardis is here.

235
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:58,065
And I say, we've made
the most extraordinary discovery.

236
00:17:58,147 --> 00:18:00,615
<i>I know what you have discovered.</i>

237
00:18:00,707 --> 00:18:04,859
<i>Do not transmit further.
Stay where you are and touch nothing.</i>

238
00:18:04,947 --> 00:18:08,098
<i>President Borusa is arriving
to take full charge.</i>

239
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:12,221
Touch nothing, indeed?
Who does he think he is?

240
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:16,619
He didn't want us to mention
the Ring of Rassilon. Natural enough.

241
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:21,267
-Something's wrong, you know.
-You haven't changed.

242
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:22,939
Still finding menace in your own shadow.

243
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:26,736
-I feel the same.
-Oh. Well, we shall soon see, won't we?

244
00:18:38,227 --> 00:18:44,097
-Doctor, are you all right?
-Be silent. Be silent, all of you.

245
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:47,065
Do not move or speak
until I give you leave.

246
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:51,659
Gentlemen, I owe you my thanks.

247
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:54,705
You have served the purpose
for which I brought you here.

248
00:18:54,787 --> 00:18:56,539
You brought us here?

249
00:18:56,627 --> 00:19:00,415
He's after the Ring of Rassilon.
He wants immortality.

250
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,418
And you were the one
who didn't sense anything was wrong.

251
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:06,022
He's a renegade,
no better than that villain down there.

252
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:08,941
We can't allow it, you know.

253
00:19:09,027 --> 00:19:11,222
The Tomb was sealed
for the best of reasons.

254
00:19:11,307 --> 00:19:13,741
And as soon as we're back
to our own time streams,

255
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:16,705
it must be sealed again, permanently!

256
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:25,258
Doctor, we need you. Join us.

257
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:29,339
He can't. Some kind of mind lock.

258
00:19:30,507 --> 00:19:33,146
Fight it, my boy. Fight it.

259
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:37,019
Concentrate. We must be one.

260
00:20:03,747 --> 00:20:07,535
You see, Borusa?
Together, we're a match for you.

261
00:20:07,627 --> 00:20:10,346
Perhaps, but you will never overcome me.

262
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:11,906
We don't need to.

263
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:14,342
Soon, Chancellor Flavia will be here
with her guards,

264
00:20:14,427 --> 00:20:16,418
or can you overcome
the whole High Council?

265
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:20,705
Why not?
I am Lord President of Gallifrey

266
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:26,783
and you are the notorious renegades.
We shall see who is believed.

267
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:29,984
<i>This is the Game of Rassilon.</i>

268
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:39,581
No, wait, my boy.
That was the voice of Rassilon.

269
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,418
It's out of our hands now.

270
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:47,483
I am Borusa,
Lord President of Gallifrey.

271
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:53,005
<i>-Why have you come here?
-I come to claim that which is promised.</i>

272
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:58,085
<i>-You seek immortality?
-I do.</i>

273
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:02,240
<i>Be sure. Be very sure.</i>

274
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:07,280
<i>Even now,
it is not too late to turn back.</i>

275
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,686
I am sure.

276
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:13,043
<i>And these others?</i>

277
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:16,915
<i>-These are my servants.
-Is this so?</i>

278
00:21:17,007 --> 00:21:19,396
-It most certainly is not.
-Don't believe him.

279
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:23,480
-It's nonsense.
-Don't listen to them, Lord Rassilon.

280
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:26,365
President Borusa speaks the truth.

281
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:31,646
<i>You believe that Borusa deserves
the immortality he seeks?</i>

282
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,126
Indeed, I do!

283
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:35,838
<i>He shall have it.</i>

284
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:40,279
<i>Take the Ring.</i>

285
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:54,156
<i>You claim immortality, Lord Borusa.
You will not turn back?</i>

286
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:59,359
<i>-Never!
-Then put on the Ring.</i>

287
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:05,596
<i>Others have come to claim immortality
through the ages.</i>

288
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:09,885
<i>It was given to them
as it shall be given to you.</i>

289
00:22:17,247 --> 00:22:22,002
<i>Your place is prepared,
Lord President Borusa.</i>

290
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:26,845
No! No!

291
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:55,920
<i>And what of you, Doctors?
Do you claim immortality, too?</i>

292
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,963
No! No, thank you!
-No, my lord.

293
00:22:58,047 --> 00:23:01,437
All we ask is that we be returned
to our proper place in time and space.

294
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:03,883
<i>It shall be done.</i>

295
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:09,121
<i>-One of us is trapped.
-I know. He, too, shall be freed.</i>

296
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:13,257
<i>So shall the one who is bound.</i>

297
00:23:13,347 --> 00:23:17,226
<i>His sins will find their punishment
in due time.</i>

298
00:23:19,587 --> 00:23:23,865
<i>It is time
for your other selves to depart.</i>

299
00:23:23,947 --> 00:23:26,586
<i>Let them make their farewells and go.</i>

300
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:33,625
<i>You have chosen wisely, Doctor.
Farewell.</i>

301
00:23:43,187 --> 00:23:45,018
Did you know what would happen?

302
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:50,340
Hmm? Oh, I'm so sorry. I suddenly
realised what the old proverb meant.

303
00:23:50,427 --> 00:23:54,579
''To lose is to win,
and he who wins shall lose.''

304
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:59,457
It was all part of Rassilon's trap
to find out who wanted immortality

305
00:23:59,547 --> 00:24:01,538
and put him out of the way.

306
00:24:01,627 --> 00:24:06,257
He knew very well that immortality
was a curse, not a blessing.

307
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:11,457
Well. Now it seems we must part,
just as I was getting to know me.

308
00:24:11,547 --> 00:24:14,425
So, you're the latest model, hmm?

309
00:24:14,507 --> 00:24:18,261
-Yes, and the most agreeable.
-Certainly the most impudent.

310
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:20,656
And our dress sense
hasn't improved much, has it?

311
00:24:20,747 --> 00:24:24,865
Neither our manners.
Well, goodbye, my boy.

312
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:27,859
You did quite well, quite well.

313
00:24:27,947 --> 00:24:31,462
It's reassuring to know
that my future is in safe hands.

314
00:24:33,147 --> 00:24:35,786
-Come along, Susan.
-Goodbye, everybody.

315
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:37,664
-Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Susan.

316
00:24:37,747 --> 00:24:41,945
-Time to go, Brigadier. Well, goodbye.
-Goodbye.

317
00:24:45,187 --> 00:24:48,702
-Goodbye, fancy pants.
-Scarecrow.

318
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:53,263
-Doctor, don't you want your coat?
-Bring it along, would you, Brigadier?

319
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:57,863
-Certainly. Well, goodbye, Doctor.
-Goodbye.

320
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:00,862
-Doctors.
-Brigadier.

321
00:25:00,947 --> 00:25:03,256
Splendid fellows, all of you.

322
01:25:06,467 --> 01:25:08,059
Well, goodbye, my dear chap.

323
01:25:08,147 --> 01:25:09,978
I must say I've had
the time of my lives.

324
01:25:10,067 --> 01:25:11,261
Haven't we, Sarah Jane?

325
01:25:11,347 --> 01:25:15,101
Have we? Well, I only have one life
and I think I've had too much already.

326
01:25:15,187 --> 01:25:18,099
Goodbye.
Yes, it was really nice meeting you.

327
01:25:18,187 --> 01:25:20,303
Thank you, Sarah Jane,
it was nice meeting you, too.

328
01:25:20,387 --> 01:25:22,378
-What?
-I'll explain later.

329
01:25:22,467 --> 01:25:24,503
Oh. Bye.

330
01:25:26,347 --> 01:25:30,465
I'm definitely not the man I was.
Thank goodness.

331
01:25:32,587 --> 01:25:35,943
-Are we all going home together?
-Watch.

332
01:25:53,707 --> 01:25:57,495
Temporal fission.
Old Rassilon is very clever.

333
01:26:26,187 --> 01:26:30,703
You are safe, Doctor.
I feared President Borusa had...

334
01:26:30,787 --> 01:26:34,382
-Where is President Borusa?
-Unavailable.

335
01:26:34,467 --> 01:26:37,186
It seems the legend
about Rassilon is true.

336
01:26:37,267 --> 01:26:39,383
You must make a full statement
to the High Council.

337
01:26:39,467 --> 01:26:40,536
Oh, must I?

338
01:26:40,627 --> 01:26:43,858
It can form
part of your inaugural address.

339
01:26:43,947 --> 01:26:45,380
My what?

340
01:26:45,467 --> 01:26:49,983
Doctor, you have evaded
your responsibilities for far too long.

341
01:26:50,067 --> 01:26:52,535
The disqualification of President Borusa

342
01:26:52,627 --> 01:26:56,302
leaves a gap at the very summit
of the Time Lord hierarchy.

343
01:26:56,387 --> 01:26:59,185
There is only one
who can take this place.

344
01:27:00,107 --> 01:27:02,985
Yet again, it is my duty
and my pleasure to inform you

345
01:27:03,067 --> 01:27:06,503
that the full Council has exercised
its emergency powers

346
01:27:06,587 --> 01:27:09,624
to appoint you
to the position of President,

347
01:27:09,707 --> 01:27:13,541
-to take office immediately.
-Oh, no.

348
01:27:13,627 --> 01:27:16,460
This is a summons
no Time Lord dare refuse!

349
01:27:16,547 --> 01:27:21,496
To disobey the will of the High Council
will attract the severest penalties.

350
01:27:21,587 --> 01:27:23,578
Very well, Chancellor Flavia.

351
01:27:23,667 --> 01:27:28,138
You will return to Gallifrey immediately
and summon the High Council.

352
01:27:28,227 --> 01:27:30,741
You have full deputy powers
until I return.

353
01:27:30,827 --> 01:27:32,658
-I shall travel in my Tardis.
-Oh, but, Doctor...

354
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:35,705
You will address me by my proper title.
I am President, am I not?

355
01:27:35,787 --> 01:27:38,381
You will obey my commands.
Into the Tardis.

356
01:27:38,467 --> 01:27:42,062
You will escort Chancellor Flavia
back to her duties.

357
01:27:42,147 --> 01:27:43,626
Doctor, wait!

358
01:27:50,227 --> 01:27:51,580
Hold tight.

359
01:28:02,507 --> 01:28:06,898
-It'll soon be goodbye, then.
-Will it?

360
01:28:06,987 --> 01:28:10,297
Well, you're off to Gallifrey
to be President.

361
01:28:10,387 --> 01:28:13,185
I suppose your Time Lord subjects
will find a Tardis that really works

362
01:28:13,267 --> 01:28:15,986
-and get us both home?
-Who said anything about Gallifrey?

363
01:28:16,067 --> 01:28:17,102
You told Chancellor Flavia...

364
01:28:17,187 --> 01:28:18,905
I told her she had full powers
until I returned.

365
01:28:18,987 --> 01:28:20,340
You're not going back?

366
01:28:20,427 --> 01:28:23,976
You know, sometimes, Tegan,
you take my breath away!

367
01:28:24,067 --> 01:28:26,137
-Won't the Time Lords be very angry?
-Furious!

368
01:28:26,227 --> 01:28:28,980
You mean you're deliberately choosing
to go on the run from your own people

369
01:28:29,067 --> 01:28:30,864
in a rackety old Tardis?

370
01:28:30,947 --> 01:28:35,498
Why not?
After all, that's how it all started.

371
01:54:16,907 --> 01:54:21,059
One day, I shall come back.
Yes, I shall come back.

372
01:54:22,387 --> 01:54:27,097
Until then, there must be no regrets,
no tears, no anxieties.

373
01:54:28,387 --> 01:54:30,981
Just go forward in all your beliefs

374
01:54:31,067 --> 01:54:34,423
and prove to me
that I am not mistaken in mine.

375
01:56:38,707 --> 01:56:39,856
Finished?

376
01:56:39,947 --> 01:56:42,586
Yes. Looks rather splendid, doesn't it?

377
01:56:43,307 --> 01:56:45,377
But will the Tardis work properly?

378
01:56:45,467 --> 01:56:47,776
Of course, once everything's run in.

379
01:56:47,867 --> 01:56:49,585
Didn't you repair anything?

380
01:56:49,667 --> 01:56:53,137
Well, the Tardis is more than a machine,
Tegan. It's like a person.

381
01:56:53,227 --> 01:56:56,060
It needs coaxing,
persuading, encouraging.

382
01:56:56,147 --> 01:56:58,536
You mean it's just as unreliable.

383
01:56:59,267 --> 01:57:01,542
You have little faith, Tegan.

384
01:57:06,507 --> 01:57:08,145
Do you blame me?

385
01:57:51,387 --> 01:57:55,346
It's marvellous here.
I feel so calm and relaxed.

386
01:57:56,507 --> 01:57:59,783
It's the high bombardment
of positive ions.

387
01:58:02,547 --> 01:58:04,777
It's like Earth after a thunderstorm.

388
01:58:04,867 --> 01:58:07,586
-Same cause and reason.
-It's beautiful.

389
01:58:08,427 --> 01:58:11,817
For some, the Eye of Orion is
the most tranquil place in the universe.

390
01:58:11,907 --> 01:58:13,625
Can't we stay here?

391
01:58:14,427 --> 01:58:17,817
Why not? For a while.
We could all do with a rest.

392
01:58:28,987 --> 01:58:31,057
Doctor? What is it?

393
01:58:32,987 --> 01:58:35,945
It's fading. It's all fading.

394
01:58:37,107 --> 01:58:38,938
What's fading?

395
01:58:39,027 --> 01:58:43,384
Great chunks of my past, detaching
themselves like melting icebergs.

396
01:58:45,507 --> 01:58:46,860
Do something. Help him!

397
01:58:46,947 --> 01:58:51,418
Oh, no! No, don't look so worried.
I'll have it all worked out soon.

398
01:58:51,507 --> 01:58:53,418
Everything's all right.

399
01:58:53,507 --> 01:58:55,737
Everything's quite all right.

400
01:59:35,667 --> 01:59:37,339
Are you all right?

401
01:59:38,107 --> 01:59:40,905
Just a twinge of cosmic angst.

402
01:59:40,987 --> 01:59:42,215
Cosmic?

403
01:59:44,907 --> 01:59:46,977
As if I'd lost something.

404
01:59:50,547 --> 01:59:52,697
What's happening to him?
What are we going to do?

405
01:59:52,787 --> 01:59:56,416
He seems to be under some kind of
psychic attack.

406
01:59:53,867 --> 01:59:55,744
-Right.
-Thank you.

407
01:59:56,507 --> 02:00:00,386
I am being diminished.
Whittled away, piece by piece.

408
01:59:58,587 --> 02:00:01,340
-Well, to civilian life.
-Hmm.

409
02:00:01,347 --> 02:00:04,305
A man is the sum of his memories,
you know,

410
02:00:04,387 --> 02:00:06,378
a Time Lord even more so.

411
02:00:07,307 --> 02:00:09,775
What can we do to help you?

412
02:00:09,867 --> 02:00:11,778
Get me into the Tardis.

413
02:00:26,067 --> 02:00:29,218
I have to find... To find...

414
02:00:30,267 --> 02:00:31,620
Find what?

415
02:00:33,827 --> 02:00:35,579
My other selves.

416
02:00:41,427 --> 02:00:44,225
<i>Mistress, do not go out.
-What's the matter?</i>

417
02:00:44,307 --> 02:00:46,377
<i>-Danger, mistress.
-What?</i>

418
02:00:46,467 --> 02:00:48,298
<i>I can sense danger, mistress.</i>

419
02:00:48,387 --> 02:00:52,858
<i>Telepathic trace faint but rapidly
increasing in strength. Do not go out.</i>

420
02:00:53,867 --> 02:00:57,985
<i>-What kind of danger?
-Positive data not yet available.</i>

421
02:00:59,987 --> 02:01:02,296
Well, I can't stay home.
You have to give me a reason.

422
02:01:02,387 --> 02:01:06,221
<i>Negative, mistress.
Data analysis shows too many variables.</i>

423
02:01:06,307 --> 02:01:09,424
<i>Danger readings
now becoming much higher, mistress.</i>

424
02:01:09,507 --> 02:01:12,305
<i>Suggestion, take me with you.</i>

425
02:01:12,387 --> 02:01:14,901
I can't. Honestly, I can't.

426
02:01:14,987 --> 02:01:17,023
The car's in dock,
so I've got to go by bus.

427
02:01:17,107 --> 02:01:21,623
<i>There is danger, mistress.
My sensors indicate it is now extreme,</i>

428
02:01:21,707 --> 02:01:23,857
<i>and the Doctor is involved.</i>

429
02:01:24,867 --> 02:01:27,301
Well, now I know
you're imagining things.

430
02:01:27,387 --> 02:01:28,900
See you later.

431
02:01:37,987 --> 02:01:42,777
<i>Danger! Doctor! Danger! Mistress!</i>

432
02:01:44,267 --> 02:01:45,495
Wordsworth.

433
02:01:47,107 --> 02:01:48,540
Rutherford.

434
02:01:51,027 --> 02:01:52,779
Christopher Smart.

435
02:01:53,667 --> 02:01:55,259
Andrew Marvell.

436
02:01:56,827 --> 02:01:58,465
Judge Jeffreys.

437
02:02:00,227 --> 02:02:01,865
Owen Chadwick.

438
02:02:01,947 --> 02:02:03,744
-Who?
-Owen Chadwick.

439
02:02:03,827 --> 02:02:06,500
Oh, yes, some of the greatest labourers

440
02:02:06,587 --> 02:02:09,863
in the history of Earth
have thought here.

441
02:02:09,947 --> 02:02:11,062
Newton, of course.

442
02:02:11,147 --> 02:02:13,707
Oh, definitely Newton.

443
02:02:14,627 --> 02:02:18,336
''For every action, there is an equal
and opposite reaction.''

444
02:02:18,427 --> 02:02:19,496
That's right.

445
02:02:19,587 --> 02:02:21,100
So, Newton invented punting.

446
02:02:21,187 --> 02:02:24,338
Oh, yes.
There was no limit to Isaac's genius.

447
02:02:26,987 --> 02:02:29,979
Isn't it wonderful
how something so primitive can be so...

448
02:02:30,067 --> 02:02:31,580
Restful?

449
02:02:31,667 --> 02:02:33,146
No, simple.

450
02:02:33,227 --> 02:02:37,106
You just push in one direction
and the boat goes in the other.

451
02:02:37,187 --> 02:02:42,136
Oh, I do love the spring.
All the leaves and colours.

452
02:02:42,227 --> 02:02:43,785
It's October.

453
02:02:43,867 --> 02:02:46,097
I thought that you said
we were coming here for May Week.

454
02:02:46,187 --> 02:02:49,862
I did. May Week's in June.

455
02:02:51,427 --> 02:02:52,940
I'm confused.

456
02:02:53,507 --> 02:02:55,304
So was the Tardis.

457
02:02:57,587 --> 02:03:02,422
Oh, I do love the autumn.
All the leaves, the colours.

458
02:03:02,507 --> 02:03:07,581
Yes. Well, at least with something as
simple as a punt nothing can go wrong.

459
02:03:07,667 --> 02:03:11,421
No co-ordinates.
No dimensional stabilisers. Nothing.

460
02:03:12,827 --> 02:03:15,705
Just the water, a punt,

461
02:03:17,947 --> 02:03:21,383
a strong pair of hands and a pole.

462
02:03:49,547 --> 02:03:50,775
Oh, no!

463
02:04:36,107 --> 02:04:37,506
Two hearts.

464
02:04:38,787 --> 02:04:42,257
Well, his body's all right.

465
02:04:42,347 --> 02:04:45,305
He just seems to be fading away.

466
02:04:49,147 --> 02:04:50,899
Why did he have
to set the Tardis moving?

467
02:04:50,987 --> 02:04:53,296
We were safe before he did that!

468
02:04:54,707 --> 02:04:55,856
Look!

469
02:04:58,067 --> 02:04:59,386
Doctor?

470
02:05:09,227 --> 02:05:11,263
What's going on?

471
02:05:11,347 --> 02:05:12,826
We've landed.

472
02:05:39,227 --> 02:05:43,140
According to the instruments,
we're nowhere, in no time.

473
02:05:45,027 --> 02:05:47,860
The Doctor must have forgotten
to reconnect something.

474
02:05:47,947 --> 02:05:49,062
No.

475
02:05:54,387 --> 02:05:56,617
The instruments
are all working perfectly.

476
02:05:56,707 --> 02:06:01,064
They just won't tell us anything.
The Tardis is paralysed.

477
02:06:01,147 --> 02:06:03,820
How did we get here? What do we do now?

478
02:06:06,267 --> 02:06:10,055
We wait until the Doctor recovers.

479
02:06:10,147 --> 02:06:11,865
And if he doesn't?

480
02:06:40,507 --> 02:06:42,145
Well?

481
02:06:42,227 --> 02:06:43,740
He has arrived.

482
02:06:45,747 --> 02:06:48,466
Involving this person
does not please me.

483
02:06:48,547 --> 02:06:51,937
The constitution clearly states
that when in emergency session

484
02:06:52,027 --> 02:06:54,302
the members of
the Inner Council are unanimous!

485
02:06:54,387 --> 02:06:57,265
-Which, indeed, we are.
-The President of the Council

486
02:06:57,347 --> 02:07:00,783
may be overruled.
What a ridiculous clause.

487
02:07:02,187 --> 02:07:04,462
Very well, have him enter.

488
02:07:06,187 --> 02:07:08,018
With all due respect, Lord President,

489
02:07:08,107 --> 02:07:11,463
your regeneration
has not helped your stubbornness.

490
02:07:18,187 --> 02:07:23,341
Lord President, Castellan,
Chancellor Flavia.

491
02:07:25,027 --> 02:07:28,906
This is a very great and,
may I say, a most unexpected honour.

492
02:07:35,267 --> 02:07:39,260
I may be seated?
Now, then, what can I do for you?

493
02:07:40,547 --> 02:07:43,300
You are one of the most evil
and corrupt beings

494
02:07:43,387 --> 02:07:46,345
this Time Lord race has ever produced.

495
02:07:46,427 --> 02:07:50,659
Your crimes are without number
and your villainy without end.

496
02:07:50,747 --> 02:07:55,867
Nevertheless, we are prepared
to offer you a full and free pardon.

497
02:07:58,067 --> 02:08:00,661
What makes you think
I want your forgiveness?

498
02:08:00,747 --> 02:08:04,422
We can offer you an alternative
to your renegade existence.

499
02:08:04,507 --> 02:08:08,056
Regeneration.
A complete new life cycle.

500
02:08:11,067 --> 02:08:12,625
What must I do?

501
02:08:14,707 --> 02:08:17,505
-Rescue the Doctor.
-What?

502
02:08:46,027 --> 02:08:51,260
-Susan? Surely it's Susan.
-Grandfather? Oh, Grandfather!

503
02:08:51,347 --> 02:08:55,386
Thank goodness I've found you!
How did you get here?

504
02:08:55,467 --> 02:08:58,743
-What's happening?
-I wish I knew, my dear.

505
02:08:58,827 --> 02:09:00,738
As soon as I found myself
in this horrible place,

506
02:09:00,827 --> 02:09:03,978
I started looking for you.
Somehow I knew I'd find you here.

507
02:09:04,067 --> 02:09:07,980
Well, the important question now is
where are we? And why?

508
02:09:10,267 --> 02:09:12,906
- We must be on Skaro.
-We were brought here.

509
02:09:12,987 --> 02:09:15,057
Perhaps the Dalek was, too.

510
02:09:16,707 --> 02:09:17,742
Run, Grandfather!

511
02:09:17,827 --> 02:09:23,823
<i>Halt, at once.
Halt, or you will be exterminated.</i>

512
02:09:23,907 --> 02:09:29,061
<i>It is the Doctor.
The Doctor must be destroyed.</i>

513
02:09:29,147 --> 02:09:34,858
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

514
02:09:39,627 --> 02:09:41,185
The Death Zone.

515
02:09:41,267 --> 02:09:46,295
Ah, the black secret at the heart
of your Time Lord paradise.

516
02:09:46,387 --> 02:09:49,185
Recently, the Zone
has become reactivated.

517
02:09:50,307 --> 02:09:53,219
Somehow, it is draining energy
from the Eye of Harmony.

518
02:09:53,307 --> 02:09:57,095
To an extent
which endangers all Gallifrey.

519
02:09:57,187 --> 02:09:59,621
We must know what is happening there.

520
02:09:59,707 --> 02:10:01,345
Did it occur to you to go and look?

521
02:10:01,427 --> 02:10:05,705
Two of the High Council went
into the Zone, and neither returned.

522
02:10:05,787 --> 02:10:07,539
So you sent for the Doctor?

523
02:10:07,627 --> 02:10:11,097
We looked for the Doctor,
but he no longer exists.

524
02:10:11,187 --> 02:10:13,223
Not in any of his regenerations.

525
02:10:13,307 --> 02:10:15,901
The Doctor has been taken out of time.

526
02:10:15,987 --> 02:10:17,215
We believe
the attempt to lift him

527
02:10:17,307 --> 02:10:19,980
from his time stream was unsuccessful.

528
02:10:21,147 --> 02:10:25,060
There he must stay until we can find
and free his other selves.

529
02:10:26,147 --> 02:10:27,865
And if you cannot?

530
02:10:30,147 --> 02:10:33,981
A cosmos without the Doctor
scarcely bears thinking about.

531
02:10:36,187 --> 02:10:39,020
What makes you think his other selves
are in the Zone?

532
02:10:39,107 --> 02:10:41,826
Their time traces. They converge there.

533
02:10:44,187 --> 02:10:46,781
And you can get me into the Zone?

534
02:10:46,867 --> 02:10:49,904
We have a power-boosted,
open-ended transmat beam.

535
02:10:49,987 --> 02:10:51,340
Ah!

536
02:10:52,667 --> 02:10:54,464
Why me?

537
02:10:54,547 --> 02:10:58,665
Because we need someone determined,
experienced, ruthless, cunning.

538
02:11:00,107 --> 02:11:02,063
And disposable?

539
02:11:02,147 --> 02:11:06,698
Not at all.
You would be useless to us dead.

540
02:11:06,787 --> 02:11:09,301
-Will you go?
Will you?

541
02:11:12,107 --> 02:11:13,984
And rescue the Doctor.

542
02:11:18,867 --> 02:11:21,779
Come on, Doctor.
Hold on!

543
02:11:27,947 --> 02:11:30,222
What's happening to you?

544
02:11:32,227 --> 02:11:36,140
I'm being sucked into a Time Vortex.
Part of me there already.

545
02:11:36,227 --> 02:11:38,787
It's pulling the rest.

546
02:11:38,867 --> 02:11:41,176
-I must send a signal.
-What signal?

547
02:11:41,267 --> 02:11:45,977
I must send a signal, find them.
I must be whole.

548
02:11:50,307 --> 02:11:55,062
<i>Halt at once. You will be exterminated.</i>

549
02:11:55,147 --> 02:11:58,139
<i>Halt! Halt!</i>

550
02:12:03,227 --> 02:12:09,985
<i>Obey. Obey the Daleks.
You will be exterminated.</i>

551
02:12:10,067 --> 02:12:14,697
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

552
02:12:17,867 --> 02:12:19,266
Oh, it's a dead end!

553
02:12:19,347 --> 02:12:21,144
That may be precisely what we need.

554
02:12:21,227 --> 02:12:24,424
-Grandfather, come on, please!
-No, no, no. Don't argue, Susan.

555
02:12:24,507 --> 02:12:25,940
Listen to me.

556
02:12:26,027 --> 02:12:30,066
When I say, ''Now,'' help me
to push the Dalek down that alley

557
02:12:30,147 --> 02:12:33,059
and when I say, ''Drop,'' drop.
Understood?

558
02:12:38,267 --> 02:12:40,303
Now! Susan!

559
02:12:40,387 --> 02:12:42,537
<i>Under attack!</i>

560
02:12:42,627 --> 02:12:43,855
Drop!

561
02:12:43,947 --> 02:12:48,577
<i>Under attack! Exterminate!</i>

562
02:12:48,667 --> 02:12:53,821
<i>Under attack! Exterminate!</i>

563
02:12:53,907 --> 02:12:59,220
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

564
02:13:16,107 --> 02:13:20,180
It's very dangerous to fire
energy weapons in an enclosed space.

565
02:13:22,187 --> 02:13:23,302
Look!

566
02:13:27,027 --> 02:13:28,904
The Dark Tower.

567
02:13:28,987 --> 02:13:30,739
We're on Gallifrey!

568
02:13:30,827 --> 02:13:32,419
The Death Zone.

569
02:13:32,507 --> 02:13:33,906
Why were we brought here?

570
02:13:33,987 --> 02:13:38,299
Instinct, my dear, tells me that
the answer to that lies in the Tower.

571
02:18:39,587 --> 02:18:40,906
Now what?

572
02:18:52,387 --> 02:18:55,777
Oh, K9, why didn't I listen to you?

573
02:18:55,867 --> 02:18:58,062
Hang on a minute.

574
02:19:06,987 --> 02:19:08,215
Catch hold of this.

575
02:19:41,267 --> 02:19:47,183
Oh! I never thought
I'd be so pleased to see anyone.

576
02:19:47,267 --> 02:19:50,418
I think we should come away
from the ledge, don't you?

577
02:19:50,507 --> 02:19:52,463
Wait a moment.

578
02:19:52,547 --> 02:19:54,936
-It's you.
-Of course it's me.

579
02:19:55,027 --> 02:19:56,096
Hello, Sarah Jane.

580
02:19:56,187 --> 02:19:59,896
-No, no, but it's you, you.
-That's right.

581
02:19:59,987 --> 02:20:02,342
No, no, you changed, remember?

582
02:20:03,267 --> 02:20:07,021
-You became all... Uh... Um...
-Teeth and curls?

583
02:20:07,107 --> 02:20:08,699
-Yes.
-Yes, maybe I did,

584
02:20:08,787 --> 02:20:10,903
-but I haven't yet.
-Oh, I see.

585
02:20:10,987 --> 02:20:13,182
No, I don't. Never mind.

586
02:20:13,267 --> 02:20:15,656
Yes, well, thank you very much
for rescuing me, Doctor.

587
02:20:15,747 --> 02:20:18,102
Now perhaps you'll explain
why I'm here to need rescuing.

588
02:20:18,187 --> 02:20:21,577
Steady on, Sarah Jane. I'm not exactly
here by choice either, you know.

589
02:20:21,667 --> 02:20:25,421
-Then what are we doing here?
-Well, I'll try and explain. Come on.

590
02:20:25,507 --> 02:20:27,065
Get in the car.

591
02:20:40,707 --> 02:20:42,186
I've got to...

592
02:20:43,387 --> 02:20:44,740
What is it I've got to do?

593
02:20:44,827 --> 02:20:48,058
-You said something about a signal?
-About being whole.

594
02:20:48,147 --> 02:20:50,707
Oh, yes, of course. A recall signal.

595
02:20:52,107 --> 02:20:55,099
What's the signal for, Doctor?
Who's it to?

596
02:20:55,187 --> 02:20:59,578
I must send the signal.
They'll hear it. That'll bring them.

597
02:20:59,667 --> 02:21:03,740
Doctor, tell us where the signal control
is so we can help you.

598
02:21:03,827 --> 02:21:06,978
It's... It's...

599
02:21:26,107 --> 02:21:29,258
It's no good. I shall have to rest.

600
02:21:29,347 --> 02:21:33,818
Oh, yes, of course, Grandfather.
I'll just go and take another look.

601
02:21:33,907 --> 02:21:35,181
Yes, yes.

602
02:21:39,827 --> 02:21:44,537
-Look! Come and see.
-Hmm? What?

603
02:21:47,907 --> 02:21:50,580
Goodness me! The Tardis!

604
02:21:50,667 --> 02:21:54,023
-What's it doing here?
-I suggest we go and find out.

605
02:21:57,387 --> 02:21:59,264
He's only just about conscious.

606
02:21:59,347 --> 02:22:02,145
If only he'd managed
to send that signal.

607
02:22:09,947 --> 02:22:11,539
Who are you?

608
02:22:11,627 --> 02:22:15,745
More to the point, what are you
young people doing inside my Tardis?

609
02:22:15,827 --> 02:22:17,579
-It's his Tardis.
-And who might he be?

610
02:22:17,667 --> 02:22:20,704
-The Doctor.
-Hmm? Good grief!

611
02:22:23,627 --> 02:22:27,381
-You're here. You're here.
-Yes, evidently.

612
02:22:27,467 --> 02:22:31,176
Now, take it steadily, my boy,
and let me help you up.

613
02:22:29,987 --> 02:22:32,182
You're talking nonsense, my boy.

614
02:22:32,267 --> 02:22:35,020
We must send the signal as planned
and wait for the others.

615
02:22:32,747 --> 02:22:34,738
I tried to send a recall signal.

616
02:22:34,827 --> 02:22:37,261
Yes, it doesn't matter.
How do you come to be here?

617
02:22:35,107 --> 02:22:36,938
No, there's no time.
We must leave immediately.

618
02:22:37,027 --> 02:22:38,779
Temporal instability
is already affecting me.

619
02:22:37,347 --> 02:22:41,420
Well, the Tardis was... I don't know.

620
02:22:38,867 --> 02:22:41,939
And without our other selves,
we'll be of little use out there.

621
02:22:41,507 --> 02:22:43,225
-Never mind that.
-Is he really...

622
02:22:42,027 --> 02:22:43,824
Well, they'll never make it.

623
02:22:43,307 --> 02:22:48,506
Me? Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so.
Uh, regeneration?

624
02:22:43,907 --> 02:22:45,738
-There is evil at work.
-Evil?

625
02:22:46,947 --> 02:22:48,903
We're in the Death Zone on Gallifrey.

626
02:22:48,987 --> 02:22:51,057
How can you be so sure?

627
02:22:49,267 --> 02:22:50,586
-Fourth.
-Goodness me!

628
02:22:50,667 --> 02:22:55,183
So, there are five of me now!
Oh, this is Susan.

629
02:22:51,147 --> 02:22:53,615
Well, the Tomb of Rassilon.

630
02:22:53,707 --> 02:22:54,935
Can we really afford to wait,

631
02:22:55,027 --> 02:22:56,585
especially if someone
is tapping his power?

632
02:22:55,267 --> 02:22:58,862
Yes, I know. And, uh, you two are...

633
02:22:56,667 --> 02:22:58,464
What do you intend to do, young man?

634
02:22:58,547 --> 02:23:02,381
-I shall go to the Tower.
-But there could be great danger.

635
02:22:58,947 --> 02:23:02,019
-Turlough.
-And I'm Tegan Jovanka.

636
02:23:02,467 --> 02:23:07,018
Help me set up the computer scanner,
we can at least see what is out there.

637
02:23:02,827 --> 02:23:03,942
Who might you be?

638
02:23:04,027 --> 02:23:06,621
I might be any number of things,
young lady.

639
02:23:06,707 --> 02:23:11,656
As it happens, I am the Doctor.
The original, you might say.

640
02:23:11,747 --> 02:23:14,864
But you shouldn't be here at
the same time, with him.

641
02:23:14,947 --> 02:23:16,778
-Should you?
-Certainly not.

642
02:23:16,867 --> 02:23:18,539
It only happens
in the gravest emergencies.

643
02:23:18,667 --> 02:23:20,259
-Like now.
-Yes, unfortunately.

644
02:23:20,347 --> 02:23:22,861
Now, look young lady.
Make yourself useful.

645
02:23:23,547 --> 02:23:26,061
This young fellow looks as though
he needs some refreshment,

646
02:23:26,147 --> 02:23:28,024
and I know that Susan and I do, too.

647
02:23:28,107 --> 02:23:31,656
-Hang on a minute.
-Tegan, Tegan, Tegan, uh, humour him.

648
02:23:29,027 --> 02:23:31,541
All this was the setting for the games.

649
02:23:31,627 --> 02:23:33,936
But old Rassilon put a stop to it
in the end.

650
02:23:31,747 --> 02:23:34,136
You know, I sometimes
used to get a little tetchy.

651
02:23:34,027 --> 02:23:37,940
He sealed off the entire Zone
and forbade the use of the Time Scoop.

652
02:23:34,227 --> 02:23:37,856
Fortunately, one mellows with age.
Turlough will help.

653
02:23:38,027 --> 02:23:39,301
Until now.

654
02:23:39,387 --> 02:23:42,424
Why don't they just tell us
why we're here?

655
02:23:42,067 --> 02:23:43,420
Thank you.

656
02:23:47,147 --> 02:23:51,265
And now, young fellow,
tell me all about it.

657
02:23:48,187 --> 02:23:50,985
Because they delight in deviousness,
that's why.

658
02:23:51,067 --> 02:23:52,819
It amuses them,
chucking us in the deep end,

659
02:23:52,907 --> 02:23:54,226
watching us sink or swim.

660
02:23:54,307 --> 02:23:55,660
Why have we stopped?

661
02:23:55,747 --> 02:23:59,296
So I can get my bearings.
A-ha! There it is.

662
02:23:58,587 --> 02:24:00,817
The Seal of the High Council.

663
02:23:59,387 --> 02:24:01,184
-What?
-The Tomb of Rassilon!

664
02:24:01,267 --> 02:24:03,303
That's where we're going.

665
02:24:02,147 --> 02:24:06,026
It may help to convince
the Doctors of your good faith.

666
02:24:06,107 --> 02:24:07,142
Perhaps.

667
02:24:07,227 --> 02:24:09,297
It's time to go.

668
02:24:09,387 --> 02:24:13,505
When you have something to tell us,
activate this.

669
02:24:14,667 --> 02:24:16,146
Do you think this is wise, Doctor?

670
02:24:15,467 --> 02:24:18,664
We will pick up your signal
and transmat you back.

671
02:24:16,227 --> 02:24:20,106
Whatever's in that Tower,
it's got enormous powers.

672
02:24:20,187 --> 02:24:22,018
What can we do against it?

673
02:24:20,267 --> 02:24:22,383
Isn't anyone going to wish me luck?

674
02:24:22,107 --> 02:24:25,144
What I've always done,
Sarah Jane. Improvise.

675
02:24:22,467 --> 02:24:25,459
We wish you success, for all our sakes.

676
02:24:39,827 --> 02:24:40,896
Doctor, wait!

677
02:24:43,787 --> 02:24:46,460
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

678
02:24:48,947 --> 02:24:50,665
No, it couldn't be!

679
02:24:51,467 --> 02:24:53,185
And now, we wait.

680
02:24:55,027 --> 02:24:57,302
I would prefer to wait alone.

681
02:25:03,067 --> 02:25:05,342
Jehoshaphat! It really is you.

682
02:25:05,427 --> 02:25:07,497
I should have known
you'd be behind all this.

683
02:25:07,587 --> 02:25:10,784
-Doctor, who is it?
-That's my best enemy.

684
02:25:10,867 --> 02:25:13,506
He likes to be known as the Master,
don't you?

685
02:25:13,587 --> 02:25:16,306
My, my, my, but you've changed.

686
02:25:16,387 --> 02:25:19,618
-Another regeneration?
-Not exactly.

687
02:25:18,427 --> 02:25:20,497
One of my predecessors.

688
02:25:19,707 --> 02:25:23,017
I take it you are responsible
for our being in the Death Zone?

689
02:25:23,107 --> 02:25:24,745
For once, I am innocent.

690
02:25:24,187 --> 02:25:26,576
Not the most hospitable of environments.

691
02:25:24,827 --> 02:25:29,662
Here at the High Council's request,
to help you and your other selves.

692
02:25:29,747 --> 02:25:31,260
You?

693
02:25:31,347 --> 02:25:33,907
Sent here by the Time Lords to help me?

694
02:25:33,987 --> 02:25:36,217
I've never heard such arrant nonsense.

695
02:25:36,307 --> 02:25:40,505
I happen to be telling the truth.
I carry the Seal of the High Council.

696
02:25:40,587 --> 02:25:43,579
-Yes, forged, no doubt.
-See for yourself.

697
02:25:46,107 --> 02:25:47,540
Stolen, then.

698
02:25:48,347 --> 02:25:50,781
I'll return it at the first opportunity.

699
02:25:50,867 --> 02:25:53,427
If you will only listen,
I'm here to help.

700
02:25:53,507 --> 02:25:56,499
You? Help me? Rubbish.

701
02:25:56,587 --> 02:25:59,226
-This is some kind of a trap.
-I knew this was going to be difficult,

702
02:25:59,307 --> 02:26:01,423
but I didn't realise
that even you would be so stupid

703
02:26:01,507 --> 02:26:03,463
as to make it impossible!

704
02:26:05,987 --> 02:26:09,616
-I knew it, a trap.
-These thunderbolts are everywhere.

705
02:26:11,307 --> 02:26:14,185
-No, we can't leave him.
-You just watch me.

706
02:26:27,747 --> 02:26:30,739
Now, as far as I can
make out, there are three entrances.

707
02:26:30,827 --> 02:26:34,137
One above, one below
and the main door, here.

708
02:26:34,227 --> 02:26:37,139
Which do you plan to use?

709
02:26:37,227 --> 02:26:38,819
Well, the main door.

710
02:26:38,907 --> 02:26:43,139
-I still think you should wait.
-There may be very little time.

711
02:26:49,947 --> 02:26:52,097
You see what I mean? A trap.

712
02:26:59,627 --> 02:27:01,538
Is there nothing you can do
to retrieve him?

713
02:27:01,627 --> 02:27:03,265
Nothing, my Lord President.

714
02:27:03,347 --> 02:27:07,260
With the present energy drain,
it is beyond our resources.

715
02:27:07,347 --> 02:27:09,065
You use what spare energy you have

716
02:27:09,147 --> 02:27:12,344
to stabilise that portion of the Vortex
in which he is trapped.

717
02:27:12,427 --> 02:27:14,702
It may at least give
the remaining Doctors more time.

718
02:27:14,787 --> 02:27:16,379
Lord President.

719
02:27:21,067 --> 02:27:23,183
No news from the Master?

720
02:27:24,907 --> 02:27:27,740
Did you really think
that there would be?

721
02:28:45,427 --> 02:28:46,496
Even if you...

722
02:28:46,587 --> 02:28:49,499
Even if you reach this Tower,
what are you going to do?

723
02:28:49,587 --> 02:28:52,704
Release the Tardis. The computer scanner
has located the force field generator.

724
02:28:52,787 --> 02:28:55,255
-I'll come with you.
-I'd like to come, too.

725
02:28:55,347 --> 02:28:59,022
No. I think it would be safer
if you were to remain here with me.

726
02:28:59,467 --> 02:29:01,776
I'd like to go with him.

727
02:29:01,867 --> 02:29:03,744
Yes, yes, all right.

728
02:29:03,827 --> 02:29:05,704
Now, you'll...
You'll bring the Tardis to the Tower

729
02:29:05,787 --> 02:29:06,936
as soon as I switch off the force field?

730
02:29:07,027 --> 02:29:09,018
-Of course.
-Yes, of course.

731
02:29:09,107 --> 02:29:11,496
Right! Better get started,
time's running out.

732
02:29:11,587 --> 02:29:12,940
Eureka!

733
02:29:24,387 --> 02:29:26,139
I thought we were going to the Tower.

734
02:29:26,227 --> 02:29:27,740
-We are.
-Then why this way?

735
02:29:27,827 --> 02:29:30,785
Because the mountains are between us
and the Tower, Sarah. That's why.

736
02:29:30,867 --> 02:29:34,382
-Can't we find an easier way?
-No, it'd take far too long.

737
02:29:35,627 --> 02:29:37,219
So,

738
02:29:37,307 --> 02:29:40,777
the Master has used the Time Scoop
to bring others as well as us here.

739
02:29:40,867 --> 02:29:43,142
Come on, let's get out of here.

740
02:29:57,027 --> 02:29:59,700
Do you think it will take the Doctor
long to reach the Tower?

741
02:29:59,787 --> 02:30:02,824
It depends on what may try to stop him,
my boy.

742
02:30:02,907 --> 02:30:05,546
It's not without reason
that it's called the Death Zone.

743
02:30:06,747 --> 02:30:09,545
Great heavens! Two more traces.

744
02:30:09,627 --> 02:30:11,857
Time Lords?
Two more Doctors.

745
02:30:11,947 --> 02:30:16,941
The scanner is keyed to my...
To our brain patterns.

746
02:30:17,027 --> 02:30:19,780
Well, well, well,
so two of them made it.

747
02:30:20,907 --> 02:30:23,421
I wonder what happened to the other?

748
02:39:13,787 --> 02:39:15,106
In here.

749
02:39:23,587 --> 02:39:26,659
-Soon be there.
-I'm finding this quite exhilarating.

750
02:39:26,747 --> 02:39:28,544
-I wish I were.
-Doctor!

751
02:39:29,427 --> 02:39:30,826
The Master!

752
02:39:32,227 --> 02:39:33,546
Wait here.

753
02:39:39,587 --> 02:39:41,339
I know this is going to be hard
to believe, Doctor,

754
02:39:41,427 --> 02:39:43,861
but, for once, I mean you no harm.

755
02:39:43,947 --> 02:39:48,498
Like Alice, I try to believe three
impossible things before breakfast.

756
02:39:48,587 --> 02:39:49,736
Go on.

757
02:39:50,987 --> 02:39:54,457
I've been sent here
by the High Council to help you.

758
02:40:00,907 --> 02:40:02,625
Is this man a friend of the Doctor's?

759
02:40:02,707 --> 02:40:03,776
Anything but.

760
02:40:03,867 --> 02:40:05,664
Well, they're talking
as if they were friends.

761
02:40:05,747 --> 02:40:07,942
That's what worries me.

762
02:40:08,027 --> 02:40:11,224
<i>I have found the ones from the Tardis.</i>

763
02:40:11,307 --> 02:40:13,537
<i>Excellent.</i>

764
02:40:13,627 --> 02:40:16,266
<i>I shall take the patrol
and destroy them.</i>

765
02:40:16,347 --> 02:40:19,180
<i>No! Capture them alive.</i>

766
02:40:19,267 --> 02:40:23,579
<i>-They must be interrogated first.
Leader.</i>

767
02:40:23,667 --> 02:40:27,819
<i>We also need
the Time Lord to pilot the Tardis. Go.</i>

768
02:40:31,667 --> 02:40:33,020
<i>Here are your orders.</i>

769
02:40:33,747 --> 02:40:37,137
-Be reasonable, Doctor.
-I am. I listened.

770
02:40:39,107 --> 02:40:43,066
As you see, I'm armed.
I could easily kill you if I wanted to.

771
02:40:43,147 --> 02:40:47,026
And not humiliate me first?
Oh, that isn't your style at all.

772
02:40:47,107 --> 02:40:48,460
I also have a recall device

773
02:40:48,547 --> 02:40:50,458
that'll take me back
to the conference room

774
02:40:50,547 --> 02:40:52,299
in the heart of the Capitol.

775
02:40:52,387 --> 02:40:53,979
So you say.

776
02:40:54,067 --> 02:40:57,742
I would prefer more positive proof
of your credentials.

777
02:40:57,827 --> 02:41:00,022
One of your other selves
took it from me.

778
02:41:00,107 --> 02:41:04,066
Do you expect me to believe
the fantastic tale you've just told?

779
02:41:05,427 --> 02:41:07,895
Doctor, look out! Cybermen!

780
02:41:09,147 --> 02:41:11,456
-Go back!
-Well, we can't just leave him!

781
02:41:11,547 --> 02:41:13,902
We can't help him, either.
Do as he says.

782
02:41:13,987 --> 02:41:15,943
We must warn the others.

783
02:41:20,187 --> 02:41:22,143
After you.

784
02:41:22,227 --> 02:41:26,778
<i>Halt!
Halt or you will be destroyed.</i>

785
02:41:44,227 --> 02:41:45,421
Zapped.

786
02:41:48,147 --> 02:41:50,707
<i>All available power to transmat beam.</i>

787
02:41:52,387 --> 02:41:53,820
Locked on.

788
02:41:54,627 --> 02:41:56,902
<i>Prepare to retrieve the Master.</i>

789
02:41:59,787 --> 02:42:02,221
<i>You will accompany us.</i>

790
02:42:02,307 --> 02:42:04,946
<i>Transfer, now.</i>

791
02:42:05,027 --> 02:42:06,699
Sorry, must dash.

792
02:42:12,667 --> 02:42:14,225
Susan, come on!

793
02:42:17,507 --> 02:42:19,543
Ow!

794
02:42:20,587 --> 02:42:23,420
-Can you walk?
-Oh, just about.

795
02:42:43,307 --> 02:42:45,457
Quite a reception committee.

796
02:42:51,387 --> 02:42:54,618
<i>This is not the Doctor.</i>

797
02:42:54,707 --> 02:42:56,823
<i>Take him.</i>

798
02:42:56,907 --> 02:42:58,226
I've been looking for you.

799
02:42:58,307 --> 02:42:59,456
<i>Kill him!</i>

800
02:42:59,547 --> 02:43:02,345
I'm here as your friend.

801
02:43:03,907 --> 02:43:06,421
<i>Who are you?</i>

802
02:43:06,507 --> 02:43:08,099
I am the Master,

803
02:43:08,987 --> 02:43:10,898
and your loyal servant.

804
02:43:17,787 --> 02:43:19,061
And then?

805
02:43:19,147 --> 02:43:21,263
Then he just disappeared.

806
02:43:25,827 --> 02:43:27,545
What could have happened?

807
02:43:27,627 --> 02:43:31,859
Well, from the way Susan described it,
a transmat device.

808
02:43:31,947 --> 02:43:34,177
Yes, but he must have got it
from the Master.

809
02:43:34,267 --> 02:43:36,144
I do hope he's all right.

810
02:43:36,227 --> 02:43:40,345
Well, with our young friend gone,
I shall have to go to the Dark Tower.

811
02:43:40,427 --> 02:43:42,657
I'll come with you.

812
02:43:42,747 --> 02:43:43,782
Oh.

813
02:43:44,827 --> 02:43:46,658
Oh, well, if you must.

814
02:43:48,227 --> 02:43:49,945
Thank you, my dear.

815
02:43:51,867 --> 02:43:55,223
It seems I've done the Master
an injustice.

816
02:43:55,307 --> 02:43:58,902
If he survived, I'm sure he will learn
to live with the misjudgement.

817
02:43:58,987 --> 02:44:00,136
Well, this changes things.

818
02:44:00,227 --> 02:44:04,539
If the Master isn't responsible,
then who is misusing the Death Zone?

819
02:44:04,627 --> 02:44:08,097
We were hoping you could tell us.
You have been there.

820
02:44:09,627 --> 02:44:11,663
Who has control of the Time Scoop?

821
02:44:11,747 --> 02:44:13,703
No one. Its use is prohibited.

822
02:44:13,787 --> 02:44:15,664
But the machinery still exists.

823
02:44:15,747 --> 02:44:21,105
Doctor, you seem to be implying that
the Time Scoop was used to bring you?

824
02:44:21,187 --> 02:44:22,939
Yes. I am rather.

825
02:44:23,027 --> 02:44:24,585
Then you accuse a Time Lord.

826
02:44:24,667 --> 02:44:27,739
I think it would be quite
an important one, as well.

827
02:44:27,827 --> 02:44:32,139
-You have evidence, of course.
-No. No, not yet.

828
02:44:32,227 --> 02:44:34,536
Then upon what do you base
this outrageous accusation?

829
02:44:34,627 --> 02:44:35,662
Cybermen.

830
02:44:35,747 --> 02:44:38,466
Whoever brought me and my other selves
here also brought them.

831
02:44:38,547 --> 02:44:40,538
Now, you know our legends well enough.

832
02:44:40,627 --> 02:44:41,821
Even in our most corrupt period

833
02:44:41,907 --> 02:44:44,501
our ancestors never allowed
the Cybermen to play the game.

834
02:44:44,587 --> 02:44:47,499
Like the Daleks, they play too well.

835
02:44:47,587 --> 02:44:49,976
Hardly proof of a traitor.

836
02:44:48,867 --> 02:44:50,698
It's a dead end.

837
02:44:50,787 --> 02:44:52,425
No, it's not. Look.

838
02:44:51,747 --> 02:44:53,305
Then there's this.

839
02:44:52,507 --> 02:44:55,067
I can't go along there! I get vertigo.

840
02:44:53,387 --> 02:44:54,866
You know,
the Death Zone is a large place,

841
02:44:54,947 --> 02:44:58,178
yet the Cybermen found us very quickly,
almost as if they were supposed to.

842
02:44:55,147 --> 02:44:58,059
Yes, well, I'll help you.
Anyway, we can't go back.

843
02:44:58,147 --> 02:45:01,219
Why not? We've shaken the Cybermen off.

844
02:44:58,267 --> 02:45:02,306
-They are highly skilled in such things.
-Especially when helped.

845
02:45:01,307 --> 02:45:04,060
They don't get tired, that's why not.
And they never give up.

846
02:45:04,147 --> 02:45:06,456
Oh, no, no. I remember.

847
02:45:05,067 --> 02:45:09,140
This is the one thing the Master would
be sure to keep on him at all times.

848
02:45:07,987 --> 02:45:09,386
Okay, well, let's go then.

849
02:45:09,227 --> 02:45:11,263
The recall device.

850
02:45:09,467 --> 02:45:11,856
If I don't fall off that path,
I'll probably die of fright.

851
02:45:11,347 --> 02:45:12,780
And within,

852
02:45:11,947 --> 02:45:12,982
-Wait!
-What?

853
02:45:13,067 --> 02:45:14,420
What is it?

854
02:45:14,347 --> 02:45:15,985
a homing beacon.

855
02:45:15,547 --> 02:45:17,424
Look.

856
02:45:17,507 --> 02:45:19,418
A Raston Warrior Robot.

857
02:45:19,907 --> 02:45:22,216
Which you gave him, Castellan.

858
02:45:20,227 --> 02:45:23,219
The most perfect killing machine
ever devised.

859
02:45:23,667 --> 02:45:27,785
It's a lie. The Doctor wants revenge.

860
02:45:24,787 --> 02:45:26,300
It isn't armed.

861
02:45:27,307 --> 02:45:29,025
Quick! Over there!

862
02:45:28,907 --> 02:45:30,420
Sit down.

863
02:45:30,507 --> 02:45:34,341
I will not submit
to such wild accusations.

864
02:45:30,627 --> 02:45:32,583
Their armaments are built in,

865
02:45:32,667 --> 02:45:36,023
and their sensors detect movement,
any movement.

866
02:45:34,427 --> 02:45:35,746
Commander!

867
02:45:36,107 --> 02:45:40,066
-Anything else I shouldn't know?
-Yes. They move like lightning.

868
02:45:40,427 --> 02:45:41,462
Lord President?

869
02:45:41,547 --> 02:45:43,299
Institute an immediate
and rigorous search

870
02:45:43,387 --> 02:45:46,379
of the Castellan's office
and living quarters.

871
02:45:52,507 --> 02:45:54,304
What's it doing?

872
02:45:54,347 --> 02:45:57,259
<i>I do not believe your lies!</i>

873
02:45:54,387 --> 02:45:55,979
Playing with us.

874
02:45:57,347 --> 02:45:59,099
What I have said is the truth.

875
02:45:57,987 --> 02:45:59,500
Right, come on.

876
02:45:59,187 --> 02:46:01,257
We've all been sent here
for the same reason.

877
02:46:01,347 --> 02:46:03,702
<i>To fight?</i>

878
02:46:03,787 --> 02:46:06,176
To destroy each other
for the amusement of the Time Lords.

879
02:46:06,267 --> 02:46:08,098
But you don't have to play their game.

880
02:46:08,187 --> 02:46:12,658
You can defeat them, gain your revenge,
but only with my help.

881
02:46:12,747 --> 02:46:14,260
<i>Explain.</i>

882
02:46:14,347 --> 02:46:16,224
Close by there's a Tower,

883
02:46:16,307 --> 02:46:17,945
the fortress of your enemies,
the Time Lords.

884
02:46:16,747 --> 02:46:20,740
Freeze, Sarah Jane.
If you move, we're dead.

885
02:46:18,027 --> 02:46:21,383
It's well defended,
but I can help you break in.

886
02:46:21,467 --> 02:46:23,537
<i>And what do you ask in return?</i>

887
02:46:23,627 --> 02:46:26,266
My life. My freedom.

888
02:46:26,347 --> 02:46:28,907
A chance to share in your revenge.

889
02:46:27,627 --> 02:46:30,460
If only we could get away from here.

890
02:46:28,987 --> 02:46:31,262
To destroy the Time Lords.

891
02:46:30,547 --> 02:46:32,424
-Can you operate the controls?
-Yes.

892
02:46:32,507 --> 02:46:36,216
But we're still trapped
by the force field from the Tower.

893
02:46:34,227 --> 02:46:37,264
<i>Guard him.
Leader.</i>

894
02:46:39,587 --> 02:46:43,182
<i>We will allow him
to guide us to this Tower.</i>

895
02:46:43,267 --> 02:46:46,942
<i>He is an alien.
Aliens are not to be trusted.</i>

896
02:46:47,027 --> 02:46:50,224
<i>It is not necessary to trust him.</i>

897
02:46:47,627 --> 02:46:49,777
Come on, Doc, you can make it.

898
02:46:49,867 --> 02:46:52,335
Well, of course I can, young woman.

899
02:46:51,107 --> 02:46:52,938
<i>Will you give him his freedom?</i>

900
02:46:53,027 --> 02:46:56,542
<i>Promises to aliens have no validity.</i>

901
02:46:54,587 --> 02:46:57,624
And kindly refrain
from addressing me as ''Doc''.

902
02:46:56,627 --> 02:47:01,860
<i>When the Tower is in our hands,
he will be destroyed.</i>

903
02:47:04,187 --> 02:47:08,465
As you can see, Lord President,
the casket bears the Seal of Rassilon.

904
02:47:08,987 --> 02:47:12,059
<i>You will guide us to this Tower.</i>

905
02:47:09,427 --> 02:47:11,224
Where was this found?

906
02:47:12,307 --> 02:47:14,298
In the Castellan's room.

907
02:47:20,187 --> 02:47:21,905
Black Scrolls of Rassilon!

908
02:47:21,987 --> 02:47:24,626
Interesting. I thought
they were out of print.

909
02:47:24,707 --> 02:47:26,663
No, don't touch, Doctor.

910
02:47:27,627 --> 02:47:30,664
This is forbidden knowledge
from the Dark Time.

911
02:47:28,747 --> 02:47:30,499
They're moving so slowly.

912
02:47:30,587 --> 02:47:33,226
Don't worry.
Tegan will look after the old man.

913
02:47:33,307 --> 02:47:37,266
If only we could make contact
with the other Doctors.

914
02:47:39,107 --> 02:47:40,586
What's that?

915
02:47:41,867 --> 02:47:44,586
Well, you were taking no chances.

916
02:47:44,667 --> 02:47:46,225
I am innocent.

917
02:47:47,227 --> 02:47:48,899
Oh, no.

918
02:47:47,267 --> 02:47:50,862
I have never seen that casket before.

919
02:47:48,987 --> 02:47:50,705
Cybermen!

920
02:47:50,947 --> 02:47:53,905
Take him to security
and discover the truth.

921
02:47:59,587 --> 02:48:01,020
Commander.

922
02:48:01,067 --> 02:48:04,423
Come along, Brigadier, come along.
This way.

923
02:48:02,627 --> 02:48:05,380
You are authorised
to use the mind probe.

924
02:48:04,507 --> 02:48:07,544
Damn it! Doctor, I'm just not built
for this kind of thing any more.

925
02:48:05,467 --> 02:48:07,264
What?

926
02:48:07,347 --> 02:48:09,861
No, not the mind probe.

927
02:48:07,627 --> 02:48:09,140
You never were.

928
02:48:09,227 --> 02:48:11,457
Cheer up,
we're getting on very nicely.

929
02:48:09,947 --> 02:48:12,017
-Let me speak to him...
-No, Doctor.

930
02:48:11,547 --> 02:48:12,741
Yes.

931
02:48:12,107 --> 02:48:15,099
The mind probe will give us
all the answers we require.

932
02:48:27,427 --> 02:48:29,577
Was that really necessary?

933
02:48:29,667 --> 02:48:33,216
Well, as you can see,
he was armed and trying to escape.

934
02:48:35,787 --> 02:48:39,097
It seems you have been saved
the embarrassment of a trial.

935
02:48:39,187 --> 02:48:41,940
And you have found your traitor, Doctor.

936
02:48:42,907 --> 02:48:44,943
Let us at least hope it will simplify

937
02:48:45,027 --> 02:48:47,143
the task of your other selves.

938
02:48:47,227 --> 02:48:48,421
Yes.

939
02:48:49,227 --> 02:48:52,219
Yes, I should be getting back to them.

940
02:48:52,307 --> 02:48:55,936
Doctor, I admire your courage,

941
02:48:56,027 --> 02:48:58,621
but I cannot allow you to return.

942
02:48:58,707 --> 02:49:01,858
It will take some time to establish
the Castellan's role in this affair.

943
02:49:01,947 --> 02:49:04,541
I need your help and advice.

944
02:49:04,627 --> 02:49:06,026
I can't abandon them.

945
02:49:06,107 --> 02:49:09,986
I'm sure your other selves
will be able to cope.

946
02:49:10,067 --> 02:49:12,103
Are they all in the Zone?

947
02:49:12,187 --> 02:49:16,260
Yes, all but one,
and he is trapped in the Vortex.

948
02:49:16,347 --> 02:49:19,896
Doctor, I'm sorry,
but I must insist that you remain.

949
02:49:20,987 --> 02:49:24,980
Chancellor Flavia, would you escort
the Doctor to a place of rest?

950
02:49:25,067 --> 02:49:27,342
I'm sure he must be exhausted.

951
03:01:32,867 --> 03:01:36,337
At least that terrible
hammering's stopped.

952
03:01:36,427 --> 03:01:38,497
That's what's worrying me.

953
03:01:39,707 --> 03:01:40,822
Look!

954
03:01:43,667 --> 03:01:45,419
What's that they're carrying?

955
03:01:45,507 --> 03:01:47,543
I don't know.

956
03:01:47,627 --> 03:01:51,222
But I would think their intention
is to try and break in.

957
03:01:54,907 --> 03:01:56,101
Doctor,

958
03:01:56,987 --> 03:01:59,945
I don't think I can take
much more of this.

959
03:02:03,827 --> 03:02:06,421
Hang on, Sarah Jane, hang on.

960
03:02:06,507 --> 03:02:08,623
I think we've got one hope.

961
03:03:20,227 --> 03:03:21,785
Now.

962
03:03:30,147 --> 03:03:33,457
Look, Sarah Jane.
The Robot's extra arrows.

963
03:03:33,547 --> 03:03:35,503
At least we'll have something
to have a fight with.

964
03:03:35,587 --> 03:03:38,738
Wait a minute.
These might come in handy.

965
03:03:40,387 --> 03:03:41,945
Let's go.

966
03:04:06,067 --> 03:04:08,979
Now what do we do? Fly?

967
03:04:09,067 --> 03:04:10,864
What a splendid idea.

968
03:04:14,987 --> 03:04:16,784
You look so worried, Doctor.

969
03:04:16,867 --> 03:04:19,939
Your friends and your other selves
will be safe, I am sure.

970
03:04:20,027 --> 03:04:23,702
At the moment I'm more concerned
for the High Council, for Gallifrey.

971
03:04:23,787 --> 03:04:26,347
-The traitor has been found.
-Has he?

972
03:04:26,427 --> 03:04:28,383
You know,
I've known the Castellan too long.

973
03:04:28,467 --> 03:04:30,139
Oh, he was limited, a little narrow,

974
03:04:30,227 --> 03:04:32,536
but always fiercely loyal
to his oath of office.

975
03:04:32,627 --> 03:04:35,619
Any mention of the dark days
filled him with horror.

976
03:04:35,707 --> 03:04:37,584
Now, you saw his reaction
to the Black Scrolls,

977
03:04:37,667 --> 03:04:41,899
it wasn't that of a man discovered,
but of sheer disbelief.

978
03:04:41,987 --> 03:04:45,024
No, I'm convinced
the traitor is still at large.

979
03:04:45,107 --> 03:04:47,746
I will speak to the Commander
who killed the Castellan.

980
03:04:47,827 --> 03:04:49,977
There may be much to be learned
from him.

981
03:04:50,067 --> 03:04:53,298
Thank you.
And I must speak to the Lord President.

982
03:04:58,827 --> 03:05:00,146
Doctor! Cybermen!

983
03:05:00,227 --> 03:05:02,946
Yes, well, see if you can hold them off,
I won't be a second.

984
03:05:03,027 --> 03:05:04,426
Yeah, right.

985
03:05:09,387 --> 03:05:11,025
Doctor,

986
03:05:11,107 --> 03:05:12,176
missed!

987
03:05:12,267 --> 03:05:14,178
Right, that should do it.

988
03:05:14,267 --> 03:05:16,223
You're crazy, that'll never work.

989
03:05:16,307 --> 03:05:19,777
Well, maybe not.
Can you think of a better suggestion?

990
03:05:19,867 --> 03:05:22,461
No? All right, then, stand well back.

991
03:05:34,427 --> 03:05:36,816
Ever resourceful, Doctor.

992
03:05:48,267 --> 03:05:49,541
Right, got you!

993
03:05:49,627 --> 03:05:52,346
-Find a foothold, find any foothold.
-Yes. Yes!

994
03:05:52,427 --> 03:05:53,655
-Have you got one?
-Yes.

995
03:05:53,747 --> 03:05:55,066
-Now, let go with this hand.
-I can't!

996
03:05:55,147 --> 03:05:57,058
Hold both loops in one hand.

997
03:05:57,147 --> 03:05:58,466
Both loops in one hand.

998
03:05:58,627 --> 03:06:00,743
I've got the other hand. Right, come on.

999
03:06:00,827 --> 03:06:03,102
That's it. Now, find another foothold.
I've got you.

1000
03:06:04,307 --> 03:06:05,899
Put it on that ledge.
Can you find that ledge?

1001
03:06:05,987 --> 03:06:07,420
-Yes.
-Good, all right, up you come.

1002
03:06:07,507 --> 03:06:10,067
-Up you come. Don't look down!
-I didn't look...

1003
03:06:10,147 --> 03:06:13,344
-Come on. Up. That's it. Come on.
-I did it!

1004
03:06:13,427 --> 03:06:15,145
-There you are.
-I did it!

1005
03:06:15,227 --> 03:06:16,546
That's it.

1006
03:06:17,547 --> 03:06:20,300
Well done. Enjoy the flight?

1007
03:06:21,067 --> 03:06:22,216
Great!

1008
03:06:35,627 --> 03:06:38,664
Well, we're here.
How do you reckon we get in?

1009
03:06:46,027 --> 03:06:48,382
Through here, would you believe?

1010
03:06:58,467 --> 03:06:59,946
Now what?

1011
03:07:00,027 --> 03:07:03,417
You're not suggesting
we batter down the door, I hope.

1012
03:07:03,507 --> 03:07:06,101
It looks very much like a bell to me.

1013
03:07:11,067 --> 03:07:13,103
It's an entry coder!

1014
03:07:19,987 --> 03:07:21,705
It's a bomb.

1015
03:07:21,267 --> 03:07:26,500
The Harp of Rassilon.
I never knew he was musical.

1016
03:07:22,147 --> 03:07:24,297
Big, isn't it?

1017
03:07:28,747 --> 03:07:31,022
Borusa either, for that matter.

1018
03:07:32,107 --> 03:07:34,143
Don't be in such a hurry.

1019
03:07:35,427 --> 03:07:39,340
Interesting. A musical key.

1020
03:07:38,307 --> 03:07:41,936
-We have to pay to get in?
-It could cost you your life.

1021
03:07:44,027 --> 03:07:47,986
A combination of notes. A tune.

1022
03:07:55,427 --> 03:07:57,816
How long do you plan
to play pitch and toss?

1023
03:07:57,907 --> 03:07:59,659
Patience, child!

1024
03:08:07,707 --> 03:08:10,301
Diabolical ingenuity!

1025
03:08:10,387 --> 03:08:13,902
Nothing happens
until you reach the fifth row, halfway,

1026
03:08:13,987 --> 03:08:16,740
and then the entire board
becomes a death trap.

1027
03:08:16,827 --> 03:08:20,297
Our ancestors had
such a wonderful sense of humour.

1028
03:08:18,667 --> 03:08:22,660
Ah, there you are at last,
my dear fellow. What kept you?

1029
03:08:20,387 --> 03:08:22,105
Do I know you, young man?

1030
03:08:22,187 --> 03:08:24,655
Believe it or not,
we were at the Academy together.

1031
03:08:22,747 --> 03:08:25,545
What kept me?
Of all the confounded arrogance.

1032
03:08:24,747 --> 03:08:27,420
-What do you want?
-To help.

1033
03:08:25,627 --> 03:08:28,187
Never mind, never mind,
you can tell me later.

1034
03:08:27,507 --> 03:08:29,862
That's the funniest thing
I've heard all day.

1035
03:08:28,267 --> 03:08:30,462
Come and take a look at this.

1036
03:08:29,947 --> 03:08:32,666
Believe what you like,
I should advise you to hide.

1037
03:08:32,747 --> 03:08:35,307
I've got some very suspicious allies
close behind me.

1038
03:08:33,107 --> 03:08:34,586
What is it?

1039
03:08:35,387 --> 03:08:37,139
Allies? Come on!

1040
03:08:35,747 --> 03:08:38,215
-Tegan.
-Sarah.

1041
03:08:41,747 --> 03:08:43,977
Enter, but be careful.

1042
03:08:50,947 --> 03:08:55,657
The fortress of the Time Lords
is at your mercy.

1043
03:08:55,747 --> 03:08:59,217
<i>Why was the main gate left unguarded?</i>

1044
03:08:59,307 --> 03:09:01,616
Oh, the Time Lords believe
no one could survive the Death Zone.

1045
03:09:01,707 --> 03:09:06,019
It's the sort of woolly thinking
that'll bring about their destruction.

1046
03:09:17,347 --> 03:09:21,306
Do you fear an empty room?
Shall I lead the way?

1047
03:09:27,827 --> 03:09:30,978
<i>-You will cross to the far side.
-Very well.</i>

1048
03:09:34,467 --> 03:09:35,695
You see?

1049
03:09:45,507 --> 03:09:47,418
<i>Take the patrol across.</i>

1050
03:10:09,347 --> 03:10:12,578
<i>You have betrayed us. Why?</i>

1051
03:10:13,427 --> 03:10:17,659
Betrayed? No. Oh, I...

1052
03:10:17,747 --> 03:10:19,499
I might have misled you a little,

1053
03:10:19,587 --> 03:10:22,465
but the safe path across
the board changes with every journey.

1054
03:10:22,547 --> 03:10:27,860
<i>You will show me the safe route,
or I shall destroy you.</i>

1055
03:10:47,547 --> 03:10:49,265
<i>Leader, the bombs are ready.</i>

1056
03:10:49,347 --> 03:10:53,465
<i>Excellent. Prepare for detonation.</i>

1057
03:11:00,387 --> 03:11:03,743
Wasn't that a little ruthless,
even for you?

1058
03:11:00,627 --> 03:11:03,585
<i>Your orders are to move back.</i>

1059
03:11:03,667 --> 03:11:05,498
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

1060
03:11:03,827 --> 03:11:06,387
In one of the many wars
on your miserable little planet,

1061
03:11:06,467 --> 03:11:09,664
they used to drive sheep
across minefields.

1062
03:11:09,747 --> 03:11:12,659
-The principle is the same.
-Not quite.

1063
03:11:10,467 --> 03:11:14,858
-Do you realise what they're up to?
-What are we going to do now?

1064
03:11:12,747 --> 03:11:15,261
This minefield is still
just as dangerous.

1065
03:11:14,947 --> 03:11:16,983
Die, it seems.

1066
03:11:15,347 --> 03:11:16,939
Do you think so?

1067
03:11:21,907 --> 03:11:24,421
Try it, Doctor, it's as easy as pi!

1068
03:11:27,587 --> 03:11:32,945
What an extraordinary fellow.
As easy as pie? As easy as pie?

1069
03:11:27,747 --> 03:11:30,545
Well, if it is a tune, what could it be?

1070
03:11:31,627 --> 03:11:35,540
A tune like... A tune like...

1071
03:11:33,027 --> 03:11:36,781
-That's what he said.
-No, he didn't!

1072
03:11:37,787 --> 03:11:40,938
He said, ''Easy as pi,''
the Greek letter pi.

1073
03:11:40,827 --> 03:11:44,979
A tune like the one that's been
under my nose all the time, perhaps.

1074
03:11:41,467 --> 03:11:44,823
Surely you know
some basic mathematics, child?

1075
03:11:44,907 --> 03:11:46,579
Of course.

1076
03:11:46,667 --> 03:11:52,583
The ratio of the circumference
of a circle to its diameter,

1077
03:11:52,667 --> 03:11:54,817
is represented by
the Greek letter pi, right?

1078
03:11:54,907 --> 03:12:00,379
Exactly! You find the safe path
by using the mathematical formula pi.

1079
03:12:01,347 --> 03:12:04,100
Oh, but the application,
the application.

1080
03:12:05,187 --> 03:12:07,382
Now, let me see, now,

1081
03:12:07,467 --> 03:12:13,497
3.14159...265. Yes, that's it!

1082
03:12:14,547 --> 03:12:16,378
You stay there, child.

1083
03:12:20,907 --> 03:12:21,976
Now!

1084
03:12:24,267 --> 03:12:26,735
I hope you've got your sums right.

1085
03:12:32,227 --> 03:12:34,058
President Borusa, I...

1086
03:12:32,467 --> 03:12:35,186
-Welcome, Doctor.
-Lord President.

1087
03:12:36,547 --> 03:12:38,185
I thought you said
the Lord President was in here.

1088
03:12:37,227 --> 03:12:39,536
You show very little surprise.

1089
03:12:38,267 --> 03:12:41,543
He is. Or at least, he was.

1090
03:12:39,627 --> 03:12:43,176
-Can it be that you suspected me?
-Not at first.

1091
03:12:43,267 --> 03:12:45,542
Your little charade fooled me
for a while.

1092
03:12:43,667 --> 03:12:46,135
-You're sure about that, are you?
-Positive.

1093
03:12:45,627 --> 03:12:51,224
Yes, it was rather neat, wasn't it?
Such a pity about the Castellan,

1094
03:12:46,227 --> 03:12:50,015
There isn't any way he could have left
without my seeing him.

1095
03:12:51,307 --> 03:12:54,538
but then, I needed someone
to use for a diversion.

1096
03:12:54,627 --> 03:12:58,381
Oh, Borusa. What's happened to you?

1097
03:12:56,187 --> 03:12:58,940
No power.
He couldn't have left that way.

1098
03:13:00,307 --> 03:13:01,740
Inform Chancellor Flavia

1099
03:13:01,827 --> 03:13:03,897
that the Lord President
has disappeared, would you?

1100
03:13:02,227 --> 03:13:05,503
You know how long
I have ruled Gallifrey, Doctor,

1101
03:13:03,987 --> 03:13:05,102
Sir.

1102
03:13:05,587 --> 03:13:08,101
both openly or behind the scenes.

1103
03:13:08,187 --> 03:13:11,145
You'd done great service. It was
only right you should become President.

1104
03:13:11,227 --> 03:13:17,257
President? How long before
I must retire, my work half done?

1105
03:13:21,067 --> 03:13:24,423
-If I could continue...
-Oh, I understand.

1106
03:13:24,507 --> 03:13:27,021
You want to be President throughout
all your remaining regenerations.

1107
03:13:27,107 --> 03:13:30,543
Oh, you underestimate
my ambition, Doctor.

1108
03:13:30,627 --> 03:13:35,064
I shall be President eternal,
and rule forever.

1109
03:13:36,307 --> 03:13:40,425
Immortality? Well, that's impossible,
even for a Time Lord.

1110
03:13:40,347 --> 03:13:44,056
I can't go on. I feel
as if something were pushing me back.

1111
03:13:40,507 --> 03:13:43,101
Rassilon achieved it.

1112
03:13:43,187 --> 03:13:48,659
Timeless, perpetual bodily regeneration

1113
03:13:45,387 --> 03:13:48,459
Yes. Yes, I can feel it, too, Sarah.

1114
03:13:49,467 --> 03:13:53,346
It's the mind of Rassilon.
We must be nearing the Tomb.

1115
03:13:50,547 --> 03:13:52,697
is true immortality!

1116
03:13:53,427 --> 03:13:55,065
You've got to fight it.

1117
03:13:55,067 --> 03:14:01,415
Rassilon lives, Doctor! He cannot die!
He is immortal!

1118
03:13:55,147 --> 03:13:57,058
-You must keep your mind under control.
-I can't.

1119
03:13:57,147 --> 03:13:59,536
I feel as if something absolutely
terrible were going to happen.

1120
03:13:59,627 --> 03:14:02,266
Sit down here. Sit down and rest
for a moment, all right?

1121
03:14:02,347 --> 03:14:04,542
Where are you going?

1122
03:14:04,627 --> 03:14:07,664
-I won't be a second.
-Well, don't be too long.

1123
03:14:22,387 --> 03:14:28,701
-Doctor? Doctor, this way.
-Mike? Mike Yates? How did you get here?

1124
03:14:28,787 --> 03:14:32,336
-Same way as you. Liz Shaw is here, too.
-Good heavens.

1125
03:14:33,387 --> 03:14:35,537
Hello, Liz. Any more of you?

1126
03:14:34,387 --> 03:14:37,902
<i>All is prepared.
Excellent.</i>

1127
03:14:35,627 --> 03:14:38,619
Someone you should know very well.
Come and see for yourself.

1128
03:14:38,707 --> 03:14:42,336
Not that little fellow in the checked
trousers and the black frock coat?

1129
03:14:39,187 --> 03:14:40,540
<i>Detonate!</i>

1130
03:14:42,427 --> 03:14:44,816
-And more. There are five of you now.
-Oh, good grief.

1131
03:14:44,907 --> 03:14:46,260
And they're waiting for you.

1132
03:14:45,627 --> 03:14:49,336
-They made it! They made it!
-Are we going to the Tower?

1133
03:14:46,347 --> 03:14:48,986
Yes, well, you wait here for a moment.
I'll go and get Sarah.

1134
03:14:49,067 --> 03:14:50,580
I'll fetch her.

1135
03:14:49,427 --> 03:14:52,225
We must be, we're on preset coordinates.

1136
03:14:54,027 --> 03:14:55,665
Immortal, Doctor.

1137
03:14:57,267 --> 03:15:00,782
No, I... I think I'll go, Mike.
She's nervous enough as it is.

1138
03:14:58,947 --> 03:15:03,657
Before Rassilon was bound,
he left clues for his successor,

1139
03:15:00,867 --> 03:15:04,496
Let Mike go.
Your other selves need you urgently.

1140
03:15:03,747 --> 03:15:05,942
who he knew would follow him.

1141
03:15:04,587 --> 03:15:06,896
No, I think I'll go, thanks.

1142
03:15:06,987 --> 03:15:09,455
-No, Doctor!
-Stop him!

1143
03:15:07,307 --> 03:15:09,775
Oh, I have discovered much, Doctor.

1144
03:15:09,547 --> 03:15:12,778
How?
You're phantoms, illusions of the mind!

1145
03:15:10,427 --> 03:15:14,215
This game, the control room,
the casket with the scrolls.

1146
03:15:12,867 --> 03:15:16,576
Stop him!

1147
03:15:15,747 --> 03:15:20,138
-The coronet of Rassilon.
-But not the final secret.

1148
03:15:18,547 --> 03:15:23,143
What's happening? Doctor? Doctor!
Oh, there you are.

1149
03:15:21,507 --> 03:15:23,941
The secret of immortality, Doctor?

1150
03:15:23,227 --> 03:15:24,421
Sarah?

1151
03:15:24,507 --> 03:15:26,623
Sarah? Of course I am.
What are you talking about?

1152
03:15:25,347 --> 03:15:30,660
It lies in the Dark Tower,
in the Tomb of Rassilon itself.

1153
03:15:26,707 --> 03:15:30,382
Listen, why did you leave me
for so long? And what was that scream?

1154
03:15:30,467 --> 03:15:32,583
They were just phantoms from the past.

1155
03:15:32,467 --> 03:15:35,539
There are many dangers, many traps.

1156
03:15:32,667 --> 03:15:35,545
Yes, well, I'm in the present
and I'm real.

1157
03:15:35,627 --> 03:15:39,176
So, you sent me to the Zone
to deal with them for you.

1158
03:15:35,627 --> 03:15:39,506
Yes. You're real enough. Come on.

1159
03:15:39,267 --> 03:15:44,341
I gave you companions to help.
An old enemy to fight.

1160
03:15:46,107 --> 03:15:51,340
-It's a game within a game.
-Only you botched it, didn't you?

1161
03:15:51,427 --> 03:15:53,258
One of my selves is trapped
in a Time Vortex,

1162
03:15:51,707 --> 03:15:53,777
Do you feel weird, Doctor?

1163
03:15:53,347 --> 03:15:56,544
-endangering my very existence.
-Oh, you have no fear, Doctor.

1164
03:15:53,867 --> 03:15:57,337
Full of strange fears
and mysterious forebodings?

1165
03:15:56,627 --> 03:15:59,539
Your temporal stability
will be maintained.

1166
03:15:57,427 --> 03:16:00,100
-That's it.
-No, as a matter of fact, I don't.

1167
03:16:00,187 --> 03:16:02,337
It's all illusion, child.

1168
03:16:00,347 --> 03:16:03,657
-I need you to serve me.
-I will not serve you.

1169
03:16:02,427 --> 03:16:07,376
We're close to the domain of Rassilon,
whose mind is reaching out to attack us.

1170
03:16:03,747 --> 03:16:07,456
You have no choice, Doctor.
I wear the coronet of Rassilon.

1171
03:16:07,547 --> 03:16:09,742
And very fetching it is, too.

1172
03:16:08,707 --> 03:16:11,141
-Just ignore it as I do.
-How?

1173
03:16:10,707 --> 03:16:16,942
It emphasises my will and allows me
to control the minds of other people.

1174
03:16:11,227 --> 03:16:14,299
Fear itself is largely an illusion.

1175
03:16:14,387 --> 03:16:17,424
And at my age,
there's little left to fear.

1176
03:16:18,787 --> 03:16:21,142
You bow down before me, Doctor.

1177
03:16:18,867 --> 03:16:21,620
No, there's nothing here to harm us.

1178
03:16:33,987 --> 03:16:35,420
