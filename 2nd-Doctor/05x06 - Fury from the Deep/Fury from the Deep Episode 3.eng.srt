1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,950
What is it, chief?

3
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,390
That noise in the impeller, sir. It's started again.

4
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,560
I think we should go down and check the main valve.

5
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,770
Oh, you do, do you?

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,040
Well, that's where we think the blockage is.

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,140
- We?   - Well, Mr Van Luty...

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,580
I thought he'd get his nose in. Come on!

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,630
You lot get back to work!

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,760
I want a work with you, Van Lutyens.

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,480
Mr Robson, there is something alive in the pipeline.

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,250
You're out of your mind, there's nothing down there.

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,760
I promise you, sir, I did hear something.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,660
You've been unnerving my crew. Now you, get out!

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,980
Listen! That's it!

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,930
- Did you hear what I said?  - Shut up and listen will you! 

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,380
Down there... in the darkness... waiting...

18
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,240
No, Jamie, don't touch it.

19
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,960
But it's only a bit of seaweed.

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,980
Yes, unless it really did move like Victoria said.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,440
Oh, how can it move. It's not a living thing, is it?

22
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,460
Everything in the sea is living, Jamie.

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,780
Well it did move! It gave me a shock. It was like a spider.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,642
Yes, well we're not taking any chances.

25
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:21,780
Hold that for me, will you?

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,850
Well what's this for?

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,860
We're going to take a closer look at this weed.

28
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,200
Now bring the bag down here. Right onto the floor.

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,260
Don't let it touch your fingers.

30
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,260
Careful, slowly does it. Mind your fingers.

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,200
There...

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,520
What are you going to do with it?

33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,720
We're going to see if an ordinary piece of seaweed really can move.

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,660
Doctor, my wife, will she be all right?

35
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,020
Oh yes, I think so. I don't think there is any panic,

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,600
but I'd get her under medical supervision if I was you.

37
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,819
Yes, I'll go back to the Medicare Centre at the Compound

38
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,240
- and arrange for her to be taken in there.   - Yes, you do that.

39
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,620
- Poor man.  - Aye. 

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,140
Hey! I thought we were supposed to be prisoners?

41
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,377
Yes, so did I. We better make the most of it, um?

42
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,740
We've got a lot of work to do back at the TARDIS.

43
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,300
She seems to be sleeping peacefully. Come on.

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,960
What is it, that sound?

45
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,820
It's uncanny... it's like a heartbeat.

46
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,550
It's stopped again.

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,850
Well this is surely proof enough!

48
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,120
Proof?

49
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,980
That there is something down there blocking the impeller

50
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,800
Rubbish! Hysterical nonsense.

51
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,320
But you heard it. That dreadful sound...

52
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,500
I heard a fault in the base of the impeller.

53
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,920
But the impeller isn't working!

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,800
Don't you believe a thing until you see it?

55
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,100
I want that pump operational in half an hour! Now get to it!

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,000
What are you doing, Doctor?

57
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,400
Well you see, Jamie, these two cylinders contain a small amount of natural gas.

58
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,320
It should be quite interesting to see what sort of effect it... it has on the weed.

59
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,160
How are you doing, Victoria?

60
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,640
I don't know, I think you ought to have a look.

61
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,600
Um... Oh yes, well that's got the natural iron... content.

62
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,260
Well I did the Bunsen test, like you told me,

63
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,900
but I found something which worried me.

64
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,560
- Oh yes, I'm not surprised. Is this hot?   - No, no.

65
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,120
- You see this a... this rusty stuff here.  - Yes.

66
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,510
Well it means that the weed is giving out a gas - probably toxic.

67
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,680
Toxic?

68
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,040
Hey, Doctor! What are these little wriggly things in the weed?

69
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,680
Now just a minute, Jamie... looking at...

70
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,040
...little wriggly things! Where?

71
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,680
Here, look. Look in there.

72
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,680
Jamie! This is it! There's molecular movement!

73
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,400
Come and see, Victoria.

74
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,500
There! Why, that's amazing.

75
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,180
What does it mean?

76
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,410
Hmmmmmmm...

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,940
It means, Jamie, that the weed is just as much alive as you and me.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,940
Ah, Mr Harris. I've been trying to get hold of you.

79
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,780
Mr Robson won't listen to reason.

80
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,480
I'm sorry, Van Lutyens, I've got something more important on my mind at the moment.

81
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,900
Important! What is more important...?

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,140
My wife is ill! Get out of my way, man.

83
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,820
- Price!   - Yes, sir

84
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,200
Is Doctor Paterson back?

85
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,060
No, we've heard nothing from D Rig, sir.

86
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,040
Right. Get on to the Matron at the Medicare Unit

87
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,205
and tell her to send a couple of orderlies over to my quarters

88
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,820
with a stretcher to bring my wife in. She's ill.

89
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,560
Yes, sir.

90
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,580
- What's the panic now, Harris?   - Oh, and get on with it.

91
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,080
Harris, I asked you a question.

92
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,860
My wife is ill. She needs medical attention.

93
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,720
What's the matter with her, she got a hangover?

94
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,800
She's very ill, Mr Robson.

95
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,900
Who says so, that Doctor fellow?

96
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,720
Incidentally, where is he and the two kids?

97
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,880
Oh... well, I left them in my quarters when I found my wife was ill.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,480
You what? Those three prisoners were in your charge and you left them there?

99
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,920
I was worried about my wife. I didn't have time to think about it...

100
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,020
That's your trouble you never do think, do you Harris, when you should.

101
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,620
Those three prisoners were in your charge.

102
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,243
I don't care. Don't you understand?

103
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,370
My wife was lying on the floor when I got there.

104
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,320
She was unconscious and that smell of toxic gas was there.

105
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,440
She's been poisoned, Robson, poisoned!

106
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,160
- And this toxic gas, where does it come from?   - Oh, I don't know.

107
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,800
And none of us will know now you've let them loose.

108
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,940
How could they possibly have anything to do with it?

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,940
That still doesn't alter the fact that you let those prisoners go without my authority.

110
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,080
Prisoners? A harmless old man and a couple of... teenagers?

111
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,380
That "harmless old man" is probably a saboteur.

112
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,180
It's probably him that's been tampering with that release valve on the shoreline.

113
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,020
Creating all those variations in pressure you got so excited about!

114
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,334
Oh don't be so ridiculous, Robson.

115
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,620
You're clutching at straws, stupidly blind to the real facts!

116
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,780
Don't shout at me, boy!

117
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,973
Mr Robson, sir. Mr Robson.

118
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,550
The impeller, it's moving again.

119
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,680
Good man. I told you it was only a mechanical fault, didn't I?

120
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,140
- It just started quite... suddenly.   - Well keep it going, man.

121
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,320
I don't know if we can...

122
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,340
Don't lose it now.

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,100
You fools! You stupid fools!

124
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,300
Well the fault's not this end! It must be jammed at the base.

125
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,160
You wanted this, didn't you? It's just what you wanted!

126
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,350
You should have listened to me, Robson.

127
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,920
What? Turned off the flow? Ruined a reputation of thirty years.

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,220
Reputation!

129
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,570
Don't you realise that what is going on here is beyond your comprehension?

130
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,400
That whatever it is that is in the pipelines -

131
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,380
that's jamming the impeller, has taken over the rigs -

132
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,080
is a menace and a threat to us all?

133
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,200
The only menace and threat around here is you, Van Lutyens and you Harris. Listen...

134
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,080
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT!?

135
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,480
I want that impeller working in half an hour.

136
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,040
I'll be in my quarters.

137
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,340
Let me know as soon as the impeller starts moving again.

138
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,540
He's cracking up, Harris.

139
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,880
Look. I've got to get back to my wife.

140
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,720
Harris! You can't go now. He's losing control.

141
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,880
My wife's been poisoned.

142
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,360
She's in good hands, ya? She'll be brought into the Medicare Unit.

143
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,880
- What can you do?   - But I ought to go and see her.

144
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,240
To hang about and worry, that's all.

145
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,620
Robson is cracking up. You're the only man with authority to take over.

146
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,720
We need you here.

147
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,340
- Chief.  - Sir.

148
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,400
Mr Robson, you know him better than any of us...

149
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,670
How do... do you think he's all right?

150
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,060
Well he's under a lot of pressure, I think his nerves are a bit...

151
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,060
Yeah pressure, strain. He's cracking up, I tell you.

152
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,960
- Well you're not helping him you know.  - That's not my job. 

153
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,370
I'm here to give technical advice, which he ignores.

154
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,880
All right, he knows a lot about engineering, but not all.

155
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,480
And what he does not know is the state of mind of those men out on the rigs.

156
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,930
He ought to know. He was out on those rigs himself long enough.

157
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,920
Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah. Plenty of professional experience of normal conditions,

158
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,720
but these are not normal conditions.

159
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,860
There is something very strange going on here,

160
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,860
but he refuses to accept the new factor.

161
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,150
So what... what do you think he should do?

162
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,520
I know what I would do - close the Compound, evacuate the rigs!

163
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,540
He'd never do it.

164
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,520
We've lost contact with two rigs.

165
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,660
We have a major blockage in the main pipeline.

166
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,920
The impeller is jammed, and we still don't know what is causing the trouble.

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,780
But we regained contact with Baxter on Rig D

168
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,370
and he said everything was under control.

169
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,800
Yeah, and we've not heard from him since. And what about Rig C?

170
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh that could be a telecommunications fault somewhere.

171
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,900
Yeah, it could be, but we have to check that it is,

172
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,800
and we have to check the valve at the base of the impeller.

173
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,740
But what does Robson do? Nothing! Nothing!

174
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,180
Well I suppose he might listen if we all put it to him. What do you think, Chief?

175
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,500
You're absolutely right of course. We must check.

176
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,740
That's it, Doctor! That's the creature I saw back at the Compound.

177
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,300
Yes. Yes, I was afraid it would be.

178
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,820
But how did it get in this book?

179
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,200
Well I told you, Victoria, this is a book of legends and superstitions.

180
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,820
This particular drawing is supplied by ancient mariners in the North Sea

181
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,940
- in the middle of the eighteenth century, Jamie.  - That's my time. 

182
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,040
You mean to say, this is the creature Victoria saw back at the Compound.

183
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,640
Yes I think there's no doubt about it.

184
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,680
Well, what about these great clumps of weed.

185
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,980
Well there's obviously some connection between the weed and the creatures themselves.

186
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,920
- Oh, no!  - Gas! 

187
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,420
Jamie! Jamie, help me get the lid on!

188
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,980
Oh, no... quickly!

189
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,280
I was right.

190
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,320
The weed formations are feeding off the natural gas beneath the North Sea

191
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,960
and giving of toxic gas.

192
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,000
Come on. We must get back to Harris'... Harris' quarters. Come along.

193
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,080
Just a minute,

194
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,970
that weed went back in its tank very suddenly, didn't it? I wonder why?

195
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,050
No, I will not listen!

196
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,730
It's you Van Lutyens, isn't it? Isn't it?

197
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:31,737
You've been undermining my authority ever since you came here. You and Harris.

198
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:34,114
You've been stirring up trouble just to get at me, haven't you?

199
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,091
You've even got the Chief on your side now.

200
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,710
One of my oldest and trusted friends.

201
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:39,420
- Mr Robson...   - At least I thought I could trust you.

202
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,628
Mr Robson, all we wanted to do is...

203
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:42,331
I know what you want! I know what you all want!

204
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:44,491
You gonna get at me, just to give up!

205
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:46,125
I'm not going to give you that pleasure.

206
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,108
Why don't you go and join him? Go on, join Van Lutyens!

207
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,160
Go on, join him!

208
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:51,931
What are you standing around for?

209
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,462
What are you starring at?

210
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:56,525
I'm in charge! I'm in charge here!

211
00:09:59,005 --> 00:09:59,668
Mr Robson!

212
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,577
I'm in charge of this Compound, Harris!

213
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:04,850
It's my responsibility! Mine! My responsibility!

214
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,028
Do you still think he's capable of running this place?

215
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:12,891
You do what you like.

216
00:10:13,325 --> 00:10:15,234
I'm going to get in touch with my people in the Hague.

217
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:16,091
What can they do?

218
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:18,914
Well they might push your people in London into some sort of action.

219
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,491
Give me a direct line to Van der Post, Hague Central!

220
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:23,154
Yes, sir.

221
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:04,537
Who's there?

222
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:06,754
Go away.

223
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:09,531
I'm not to be disturbed.

224
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:49,154
Aaarrgh!

225
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:55,862
Mr Robson!

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,662
No... no... aarrgh! My face... aarrgh!

227
00:12:01,474 --> 00:12:04,491
Mr Robson, wait! I need your permission to send two men down the impeller shaft...

228
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:18,822
Well, thank you, Victoria.

229
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:24,422
Yes, nobody here. Better that way.

230
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,348
You speak for yourself. I'd rather... ah!

231
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:28,491
Oh no!

232
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:29,245
Ahtchoo!

233
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,097
- Gas!   - Where's it coming from?

234
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:32,300
Jamie, try the kitchen.

235
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,910
Mrs Harris! She's gone away! FIXME

236
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,870
Mrs Harris?

237
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,354
Mrs Harris. Oh yes of course, Mr Harris had her taken over to the medical centre.

238
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,805
At least I hope he did.

239
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,748
- Doctor, quick help me!   - That's Jamie!

240
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,120
- Jamie!   - Doctor, I'm in here.

241
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,490
I can't hold out much longer.

242
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,925
FIXME - Quick! The terrace!   - Victoria, follow me!

243
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,880
FIXME What are we going to do?

244
00:13:46,102 --> 00:13:47,017
Give me a hand!

245
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,840
FIXME Come on!

246
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,620
FIXME Jamie, Catch this!

247
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,230
FIXME Come on, you can do this! Come on.

248
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,120
Press it down, Victoria!

249
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,160
Yes, it's in here, look!

250
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,977
- Well it was in here. I saw it!   - You did?

251
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,868
Yes, it was moving. Something alive.

252
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:21,960
You don't believe me!

253
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,794
Oh yes, I believe you, Mr Harris.

254
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,691
It must have come out of the ventilator grille,

255
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,220
like it did in the oxygen store.

256
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:28,971
You mean when that girl Victoria was locked in.

257
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,262
Yeah. And having achieved its purpose, back down the shaft.

258
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,634
Purpose? What purpose?

259
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,245
Who knows? We know very little about it.

260
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,220
- And no one's tried to find out.  -  I know.

261
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:38,148
Least of all Robson.

262
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,274
Yes, he rushed out of here as though he were...

263
00:14:40,594 --> 00:14:41,890
he was out of his mind.

264
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,960
You better alert security. He may do himself some harm.

265
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:45,920
Yes, you're right.

266
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,274
At least the stuff won't get out of here.

267
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:53,737
Oh really, Mr Harris. There must be hundreds of grills in this Compound.

268
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:57,160
And once the foam has got into the shaft it could emerge from any one of them.

269
00:14:57,222 --> 00:15:00,834
I suppose you're right. Then we must insist that all emergency ventilators are kept shut.

270
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,205
- Mr Harris, you know what you must do now?   - Do?

271
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:07,240
Assert yourself. Take over the Compound.

272
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,291
- Price! - Yes, sir?

273
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,247
I want you to alert the security posts.

274
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,851
Mr Robson may be ill. I'd like to know his whereabouts.

275
00:15:15,897 --> 00:15:16,445
Very good, sir.

276
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,870
And order all areas to keep their emergency air vents closed. Understand?

277
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,680
Yes, sir.

278
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:22,034
You're taking over then?

279
00:15:22,262 --> 00:15:24,480
Robson is still officially in charge.

280
00:15:32,045 --> 00:15:34,251
I've already informed my authorities at the Hague.

281
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:36,850
You must do the same with your Director in London.

282
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:43,348
Yes.

283
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:46,742
- Price.  - Yes, sir?

284
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,520
Get me Board Headquarters. I want to speak to Megan Jones.

285
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,280
Are you all right, Jamie?

286
00:15:57,371 --> 00:15:58,434
Oh, I've come over dizzy.

287
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,782
Well you just rest a while.

288
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:01,062
I'll just get my breath back.

289
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:04,777
Doctor, why is it that we always land up in trouble?

290
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:09,030
Well Victoria, it's the spice of life, my dear.

291
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:10,754
Well I'm not so sure.

292
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,760
I don't really like being scared out of my wits every second.

293
00:16:14,228 --> 00:16:15,154
Is something wrong?

294
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,691
Well I just wish that one...

295
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:21,382
Oh never mind.

296
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,550
You 'right, Jamie? Come with me.

297
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,940
What's the matter with Victoria?

298
00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:30,070
Thank you, Miss Jones. We'll see you then in three hours time. Goodbye.

299
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,388
Three hours, and the whole Compound will be crawling with board officials.

300
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,182
Let's hope the situation doesn't get any worse.

301
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:40,810
I only hope Megan Jones understands why I've taken over.

302
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:44,788
It was she who insisted that Robson should know this particular complex in the early days.

303
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,142
You did right, I will stand by you. You couldn't let Robson go on.

304
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,651
You had the men on the rigs to think of.

305
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,910
They are now her responsibility.

306
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,857
If only we knew what we were up against.

307
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:54,830
These creatures that have been getting into the refinery,

308
00:16:54,937 --> 00:16:56,857
where do they come from? We don't even know what they are?

309
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,620
That's where you're wrong, Mr Harris.

310
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,580
We do know what they are. At least I think we do. 

311
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
- Seaweed!  - Seaweed?

312
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,760
Yes. Not the sort that you'd normally find on the beach.

313
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,860
This seaweed happens to be dangerously alive.

314
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,260
- Alive? But how can it be...  - I think you better listen to me. 

315
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,120
I think you'd all better listen to me.

316
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,020
Large formations of seaweed have been coming up on the beaches along this coast.

317
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,640
Seaweed that shows clear indications of having life like human beings.

318
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,160
Is it this seaweed that's blocking the pipes then?

319
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,560
Yes, I think there's no doubt about it.

320
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,480
- We must clear the base of the impeller.  - No wait! 

321
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,940
The weed is capable of protecting itself.

322
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,720
It gives of a toxic gas.

323
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,100
It's also a parasite. It attaches itself to other living things.

324
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,340
You mean human beings? But what happens to them?

325
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,560
I'm afraid I don't know.

326
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,360
But my wife was stung by the seaweed.

327
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,740
Ah yes, but she survived, didn't she? How is she?

328
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,260
Well I asked the Medicare Centre to bring her in.

329
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,980
Price. Get Medicare for me and ask how my wife is now.

330
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:56,620
Doctor, I've just seen one of these creature things that your young friend saw in the Oxygen Room.

331
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,860
- Oh, where? - In Mr Robson's cabin.

332
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It might have attacked him.

333
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,440
He was in a wild state when I went in and just run out.

334
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,740
- He hasn't been seen since.   - Oh dear.

335
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,580
- Mr Harris, sir.   - Yes?

336
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,300
The Matron says she's sorry, she hasn't brought your wife in yet.

337
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,200
But she's sending someone over now.

338
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,300
- What!   - What is it, Doctor?

339
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,120
Well we've just come from your quarters, your wife wasn't there!

340
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,100
- The place was covered with seaweed...   - Is this right?

341
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,600
- Yes. Yes, I'm afraid it is.  - Then where is she? 

342
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,000
Where is she? I must go and find her.

343
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,260
Wait! Well where do you think she is?

344
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,420
Do you think it has anything to do with this seaweed stuff?

345
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,560
I don't know. I simply don't know.

346
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,340
There is little time. You know what you must do?

347
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,130
Yes

348
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,340
You will obey?
