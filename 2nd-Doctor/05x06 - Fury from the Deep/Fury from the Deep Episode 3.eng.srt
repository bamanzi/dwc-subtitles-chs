1
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:26,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:42,459
What's the matter?

3
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:47,069
Mr Robson, that noise in the impeller, it's started again. I think we should go down and check the main valve.

4
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:48,272
Oh, you do, do you?

5
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,905
It's right where we think the blockage is.

6
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:50,830
We?

7
00:00:51,282 --> 00:00:52,510
Well, Mr Van Luty...

8
00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:54,461
Mr Van Lutyens. I thought he'd get his nose in.

9
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:55,652
Come on!

10
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:57,133
You lot get back to work!

11
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,796
Van Lutyens, I want to talk to you.

12
00:00:58,996 --> 00:01:01,650
Mr Robson, there is something alive in the pipeline.

13
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:03,256
You're out of your mind, there's nothing down there.

14
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:04,765
I promise you, sir, I did hear something.

15
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:06,911
You've been unnerving my crew. Now you, get out!

16
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:07,786
Listen!

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,790
That's it!

18
00:01:08,922 --> 00:01:09,933
Did you hear what I said?

19
00:01:10,092 --> 00:01:17,412
Shut up and listen will you! Down there... in the darkness... waiting...

20
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,242
No, Jamie, don't touch it.

21
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:22,961
But it's only a piece of seaweed.

22
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:26,989
Yes, unless it really did move like Victoria said.

23
00:01:27,203 --> 00:01:29,101
Oh, how can it move. It's not a living thing, is it?

24
00:01:29,362 --> 00:01:31,224
Everything in the sea is living, Jamie.

25
00:01:31,422 --> 00:01:34,782
Well it did move! It gave me a shock. It was like a spider.

26
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:37,420
Yes, well we're not taking any chances. Hold that for me, will you?

27
00:01:37,736 --> 00:01:38,851
Well what's this for?

28
00:01:39,014 --> 00:01:45,219
We're going to take a closer look at this weed. Now bring the bag down here. Right onto the floor. Don't let it touch your fingers.

29
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:51,038
Careful, slowly does it. Mind your fingers. There...

30
00:01:52,168 --> 00:01:53,341
What are you going to do with it?

31
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:56,312
We're going to see if an ordinary piece of seaweed really can move.

32
00:01:56,498 --> 00:01:58,268
Doctor, my wife, will she be all right?

33
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:04,147
Oh yes, I think so. I don't think there is any panic, but I'd get her under medical supervision if I was you.

34
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:07,533
Yes, I'll go back to the Medicare Centre at the Compound and arrange for her to be taken in there.

35
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,901
Yes, you do that.

36
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:13,363
Poor man.

37
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:18,348
Aye. Hey! I thought we were supposed to be prisoners?

38
00:02:18,627 --> 00:02:28,502
Yes, so did I. We better make the most of it, um. We've got a lot of work to do back at the TARDIS. She seems to be sleeping peacefully. Come on.

39
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:42,827
What is it, that sound?

40
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:46,024
It's uncanny... it's like a heartbeat.

41
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:47,750
It's stopped again.

42
00:02:48,163 --> 00:02:50,051
Well this is surely proof enough!

43
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:51,111
Proof?

44
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:52,748
That there is something down there blocking the impeller

45
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,606
Rubbish! Hysterical nonsense.

46
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:56,081
But you heard it. That dreadful sound...

47
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,302
I heard a fault in the base of the impeller.

48
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,343
But the impeller isn't working! Don't you believe a thing until you see it?

49
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:04,850
I want that pump operational in half an hour! Now get to it!

50
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,421
What are you doing, Doctor?

51
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:33,124
Well you see, Jamie, these two cylinders contain a small amount of natural gas. It should be quite interesting to see what sort of effect it... it has on the weed. How are you doing, Victoria?

52
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:36,841
I don't know, I think you ought to have a look.

53
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:41,632
Um... Oh yes, well that's got the natural iron... content.

54
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:46,692
Well I did the Bunsen test, like you told me, but I found something which worried me.

55
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:48,818
Oh yes, I'm not surprised. Is this hot?

56
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:49,947
No, no.

57
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:52,452
You see this a... this rusty stuff here.

58
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:53,300
Yes.

59
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,913
Well it means that the weed is giving out a gas - probably toxic.

60
00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:56,979
Toxic?

61
00:03:57,235 --> 00:03:58,210
Um.

62
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:03,446
Hey, Doctor! What are these little wriggly things in the weed?

63
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:06,747
Now just a minute, Jamie... looking at...

64
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:08,706
...little wriggly things! Where?

65
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:10,566
Here, look. Look in there.

66
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:20,902
Jamie! This is it! There's molecular movement! Come and see, Victoria. There! Why, that's amazing.

67
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:22,582
What does it mean?

68
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:23,814
Hmmmmmmm...

69
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:27,344
It means, Jamie, that the weed is just as much alive as you and me.

70
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,871
Ah, Mr Harris. I've been trying to get hold of you. Mr Robson won't listen to reason.

71
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,891
I'm sorry, Van Lutyens, I've got something more important on my mind at the moment.

72
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:43,295
Important! What is more important...?

73
00:04:43,442 --> 00:04:45,455
My wife is ill! Get out of my way, man.

74
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:46,413
Price!

75
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:47,409
Yes, sir

76
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:48,503
Is Doctor Paterson back?

77
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:50,251
No, we've heard nothing from D Rig, sir.

78
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:55,828
Right. Get on to the Matron at the Medicare Unit and tell her to send a couple of orderlies over to my quarters with a stretcher to bring my wife in. She's ill.

79
00:04:56,015 --> 00:04:56,806
Yes, sir.

80
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,970
What's the panic now, Harris?

81
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,005
Oh, and get on with it.

82
00:05:00,128 --> 00:05:01,325
Harris, I asked you a question.

83
00:05:01,446 --> 00:05:02,864
My wife is ill. She needs medical attention.

84
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:04,648
What's the matter with her, she got a hangover?

85
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,950
She's very ill, Mr Robson.

86
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:11,454
Who says so, that Doctor fellow? Incidentally, where is he and the two kids?

87
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:14,162
Oh... well, I left them in my quarters when I found my wife was ill.

88
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:17,880
You what? Those three prisoners were in your charge and you left them there?

89
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:20,406
I was worried about my wife. I didn't have time to think about it...

90
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,935
That's your trouble you never do think, do you Harris, when you should. Those three prisoners were in your charge.

91
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:31,688
I don't care. Don't you understand? My wife was lying on the floor when I got there. She was unconscious and that smell of toxic gas was there. She's been poisoned, Robson, poisoned!

92
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:34,415
And this toxic gas, where does it come from?

93
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:35,466
Oh, I don't know.

94
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:36,921
And none of us will know now you've let them loose.

95
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,690
How could they possibly have anything to do with it?

96
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:41,334
That still doesn't alter the fact that you let those prisoners go without my authority.

97
00:05:41,494 --> 00:05:44,083
Prisoners? A harmless old man and a couple of... teenagers?

98
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:51,974
That "harmless old man" is probably a saboteur. It's probably him that's been tampering with that release valve on the shoreline. Creating all those variations in pressure you got so excited about!

99
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:55,505
Oh don't be so ridiculous, Robson. You're clutching at straws, stupidly blind to the real facts!

100
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:56,885
Don't shout at me, boy!

101
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,651
Mr Robson, sir. Mr Robson. The impeller, it's moving again.

102
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,409
Good man. I told you it was only a mechanical fault, didn't I?

103
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:11,019
It just started quite... suddenly.

104
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,526
Well keep it going, man.

105
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,021
I don't know if we can...

106
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:16,626
Don't lose it now.

107
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:19,803
You fools! You stupid fools!

108
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:21,922
Well the fault's not this end! It must be jammed at the base.

109
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,783
You wanted this, didn't you? It's just what you wanted!

110
00:06:23,957 --> 00:06:25,051
You should have listened to me, Robson.

111
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,330
What? Turned off the flow? Ruined a reputation of thirty years.

112
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:36,098
Reputation! Don't you realise that what is going on here is beyond your comprehension? That whatever it is that is in the pipelines - that's jamming the impeller, has taken over the rigs - is a menace and a threat to us all?

113
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:41,404
The only menace and threat around here is you, Van Lutyens and you Harris. Listen...

114
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:43,352
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT!?

115
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:48,292
I want that impeller working in half an hour. I'll be in my quarters. Let me know as soon as the impeller starts moving again.

116
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:52,760
He's cracking up, Harris.

117
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:54,478
Look. I've got to get back to my wife.

118
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:56,309
Harris! You can't go now. He's losing control.

119
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:57,582
My wife's been poisoned.

120
00:06:57,734 --> 00:07:00,203
She's in good hands, ya? She'll be brought into the Medicare Unit. What can you do?

121
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:01,318
But I ought to go and see her.

122
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:07,661
To hang about and worry, that's all. Robson is cracking up. You're the only man with authority to take over. We need you here.

123
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,898
Chief.

124
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:11,893
Sir.

125
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:16,376
Mr Robson, you know him better than any of us... How do... do you think he's all right?

126
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:19,304
Well he's under a lot of pressure, I think his nerves are a bit...

127
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:20,773
Yeah pressure, strain. He's cracking up, I tell you.

128
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:22,064
Well you're not helping him you know.

129
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:31,101
That's not my job. I'm here to give technical advice, which he ignores. All right, he knows a lot about engineering, but not all. And what he does not know is the state of mind of those men out on the rigs.

130
00:07:31,277 --> 00:07:33,430
He ought to know. He was out on those rigs himself long enough.

131
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:43,225
Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah. Plenty of professional experience of normal conditions, but these are not normal conditions. There is something very strange going on here, but he refuses to accept the new factor.

132
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:45,652
So what... what do you think he should do?

133
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:49,029
I know what I would do - close the Compound, evacuate the rigs!

134
00:07:49,222 --> 00:07:50,311
He'd never do it.

135
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:57,171
We've lost contact with two rigs. We have a major blockage in the main pipeline. The impeller is jammed, and we still don't know what is causing the trouble.

136
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,874
But we regained contact with Baxter on Rig D and he said everything was under control.

137
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,082
Yeah, and we've not heard from him since. And what about Rig C?

138
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:06,362
Oh that could be a telecommunications fault somewhere.

139
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:11,922
Yeah, it could be, but we have to check that it is, and we have to check the valve at the base of the impeller. But what does Robson do? Nothing! Nothing!

140
00:08:12,137 --> 00:08:15,482
Well I suppose he might listen if we all put it to him. What do you think, Chief?

141
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:20,691
You're absolutely right of course. We must check.

142
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:24,531
That's it, Doctor! That's the creature I saw back at the Compound.

143
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:27,010
Yes. Yes, I was afraid it would be.

144
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:28,628
But how did it get in this book?

145
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:39,501
Well I told you, Victoria, this is a book of legends and superstitions. This particular drawing is supplied by ancient mariners in the North Sea in the middle of the eighteenth century, Jamie.

146
00:08:39,683 --> 00:08:43,564
That's my time. You mean to say, this is the creature Victoria saw back at the Compound.

147
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,446
Yes I think there's no doubt about it.

148
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,139
Well, what about these great clumps of weed.

149
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,496
Well there's obviously some connection between the weed and the creatures themselves.

150
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:51,773
Ah, aahh.

151
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:52,659
Oh, no!

152
00:08:52,873 --> 00:08:56,026
Gas! Jamie! Jamie, help me get the lid on! Oh, no... quickly!

153
00:09:09,225 --> 00:09:26,586
I was right. The weed formations are feeding off the natural gas beneath the North Sea and giving of toxic gas. Come on. We must get back to Harris'... Harris' quarters. Come along. Just a minute, that weed went back in its tank very suddenly, didn't it? I wonder why? Come on.

154
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:27,583
Oh!

155
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:46,119
No, I will not listen! It's you Van Lutyens, isn't it? Isn't it? You've been undermining my authority ever since you came here. You and Harris. You've been stirring up trouble just to get at me, haven't you? You've even got the Chief on your side now. One of my oldest and trusted friends.

156
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:46,932
Mr Robson...

157
00:09:47,157 --> 00:09:48,228
At least I thought I could trust you.

158
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:49,495
Mr Robson, all we wanted to do is...

159
00:09:49,646 --> 00:10:04,457
I know what you want! I know what you all want! You gonna get at me, just to give up! I'm not going to give you that pleasure. Why don't you go and join him? Go on, join Van Lutyens! Go on, join him! What are you standing around for? What are you starring at? I'm in charge! I'm in charge here!

160
00:10:07,313 --> 00:10:07,945
Mr Robson!

161
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:13,514
I'm in charge of this Compound, Harris! It's my responsibility! Mine! My responsibility!

162
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:23,189
Do you still think he's capable of running this place? You do what you like. I'm going to get in touch with my people in the Hague.

163
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:24,300
What can they do?

164
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:30,416
Well they might push your people in London into some sort of action. Give me a direct line to Van der Post, Hague Central!

165
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,493
Yes, sir.

166
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:17,162
Who's there? Go away. I'm not to be disturbed.

167
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:55,942
Aaarrgh!

168
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:02,491
Mr Robson!

169
00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:07,362
No... no... aarrgh! My face... aarrgh!

170
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:10,981
Mr Robson, wait! I need your permission to send two men down the impeller shaft...

171
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:31,003
Well, thank you, Victoria. Yes, nobody here. Better that way.

172
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:33,845
You speak for yourself. I'd rather... ah!

173
00:12:34,063 --> 00:12:34,886
Oh no!

174
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:36,121
Ahtchoo!

175
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:36,966
Gas!

176
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:38,009
Where's it coming from?

177
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:39,102
Jamie, try the kitchen.

178
00:13:01,454 --> 00:13:06,715
Mrs Harris! She's gone away!

179
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:07,674
Mrs Harris?

180
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:15,142
Mrs Harris. Oh yes of course, Mr Harris had her taken over to the medical centre. At least I hope he did.

181
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:16,757
Doctor, quick help me!

182
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:17,590
That's Jamie!

183
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:18,361
Jamie!

184
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,514
Doctor, I'm in here.

185
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:21,697
I can't hold out much longer.

186
00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:23,062
Oh! Oh!

187
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,030
Quick! The terrace!

188
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:42,271
Victoria, follow me!

189
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:46,081
What are we going to do?

190
00:13:51,114 --> 00:13:52,127
Give me a hand!

191
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:56,044
Come on!

192
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:58,827
Jamie, Catch this!

193
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:03,436
Come on, you can do this! Come on.

194
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,722
Press it down, Victoria!

195
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,004
In here, look!

196
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:19,571
Well it was in here. I saw it!

197
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,608
You did?

198
00:14:20,863 --> 00:14:26,624
Yes, it was moving. Something alive. You don't believe me!

199
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:31,489
Oh yes, I believe you, Mr Harris. It must have come out of the ventilator grille, like it did in the oxygen store.

200
00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:33,413
You mean when that girl Victoria was locked in.

201
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:36,437
Yeah. And having achieved its purpose, back down the shaft.

202
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,084
Purpose? What purpose?

203
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:40,837
Who knows? We know very little about it. And no one's tried to find out.

204
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:41,727
I know.

205
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,069
Least of all Robson.

206
00:14:43,243 --> 00:14:46,816
Yes, he rushed out of here as though he were... he was out of his mind.

207
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:49,079
You better alert security. He may do himself some harm.

208
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:54,305
Yes, you're right. At least the stuff won't get out of here.

209
00:14:54,523 --> 00:15:01,660
Oh really, Mr Harris. There must be hundreds of grills in this Compound. And once the foam has got into the shaft it could emerge from any one of them.

210
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:05,567
I suppose you're right. Then we must insist that all emergency ventilators are kept shut.

211
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,254
Mr Harris, you know what you must do now?

212
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,083
Do?

213
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:11,041
Assert yourself. Take over the Compound.

214
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:14,283
Price!

215
00:15:14,521 --> 00:15:15,228
Yes, sir.

216
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:19,372
I want you to alert the security posts. Mr Robson may be ill. I'd like to know his whereabouts.

217
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,443
Very good, sir.

218
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:23,678
And order all areas to keep their emergency air vents closed. Understand?

219
00:15:23,818 --> 00:15:24,489
Yes, sir.

220
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:25,653
You're taking over then?

221
00:15:25,787 --> 00:15:28,284
Robson is still officially in charge.

222
00:15:34,802 --> 00:15:40,657
I've already informed my authorities at the Hague. You must do the same with your Director in London.

223
00:15:45,768 --> 00:15:49,260
Yes. Price.

224
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,093
Yes, sir.

225
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:52,318
Get me Board Headquarters. I want to speak to Megan Jones.

226
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:00,178
Are you all right, Jamie?

227
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:01,184
Oh, I've come over dizzy.

228
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:03,010
Well you just rest a while.

229
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:04,284
I'll just get my breath back.

230
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:08,442
Doctor, why is it that we always land up in trouble?

231
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,134
Well Victoria, it's the spice of life, my dear.

232
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:16,863
Well I'm not so sure. I don't really like being scared out of my wits every second.

233
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:18,485
Is something wrong?

234
00:16:18,717 --> 00:16:24,250
Well I just wish that one... Oh never mind.

235
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:27,652
You 'right, Jamie? Come with me.

236
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:29,548
What's the matter with Victoria?

237
00:16:29,732 --> 00:16:32,677
Thank you, Miss Jones. We'll see you then in three hours time. Goodbye.

238
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:38,885
Three hours, and the whole Compound will be crawling with board officials.

239
00:16:39,073 --> 00:16:40,547
Let's hope the situation doesn't get any worse.

240
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:47,009
I only hope Megan Jones understands why I've taken over. It was she who insisted that Robson should know this particular complex in the early days.

241
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:53,217
You did right, I will stand by you. You couldn't let Robson go on. You had the men on the rigs to think of. They are now her responsibility.

242
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:58,829
If only we knew what we were up against. These creatures that have been getting into the refinery, where do they come from? We don't even know what they are?

243
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:06,135
That's where you're wrong, Mr Harris. We do know what they are. At least I think we do. Seaweed!

244
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:07,463
Seaweed?

245
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:13,755
Yes. Not the sort that you'd normally find on the beach. This seaweed happens to be dangerously alive.

246
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:14,869
Alive? But how can it be...

247
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:28,942
I think you better listen to me. I think you'd all better listen to me. Large formations of seaweed have been coming up on the beaches along this coast. Seaweed that shows clear indications of having life like human beings.

248
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:30,899
Is it this seaweed that's blocking the pipes then?

249
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:32,356
Yes, I think there's no doubt about it.

250
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,509
We must clear the base of the impeller.

251
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:41,708
No wait! The weed is capable of protecting itself. It gives of a toxic gas. It's also a parasite. It attaches itself to other living things.

252
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:44,255
You mean human beings? But what happens to them?

253
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:45,561
I'm afraid I don't know.

254
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:47,070
But my wife was stung by the seaweed.

255
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:49,107
Ah yes, but she survived, didn't she? How is she?

256
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:57,792
Well I asked the Medicare Centre to bring her in. Price. Get Medicare for me and ask how my wife is now. Doctor, I've just seen one of these creature things that your young friend saw in the Oxygen Room.

257
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,976
Oh, where?

258
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:05,110
In Mr Robson's cabin. It might have attacked him. He was in a wild state when I went in and just run out. He hasn't been seen since.

259
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,235
Oh dear.

260
00:18:06,454 --> 00:18:07,262
Mr Harris, sir.

261
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:07,965
Yes?

262
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,784
The Matron says she's sorry, she hasn't brought your wife in yet. But she's sending someone over now.

263
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:12,979
What!

264
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:14,337
What is it, Doctor?

265
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,971
Well we've just come from your quarters, your wife wasn't there!

266
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:18,418
The place was covered with seaweed...

267
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:19,572
Is this right?

268
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:20,810
Yes. Yes, I'm afraid it is.

269
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:23,402
Then where is she? Where is she? I must go and find her.

270
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:30,328
Wait! Well where do you think she is? Do you think it has anything to do with this seaweed stuff?

271
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,447
I don't know. I simply don't know.

272
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:04,461
There is little time. You know what you must do?

273
00:19:04,668 --> 00:19:05,534
Yes

274
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:07,821
You will obey?
