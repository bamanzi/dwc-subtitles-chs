1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:08,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,440
Doctor... Jamie... hurry.

3
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,640
Victoria! Victoria, where are you!? Victoria!

4
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,720
No!

5
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,980
Gas!

6
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,600
- What happened?  - Deep breath.

7
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,780
- Take deep breaths. - What's going on here?

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,220
Who let you three out of the cabin?

9
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,570
Mr Robson, in here, it's gas!

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,040
Check it then. Find out what it is.

11
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,730
Oh, Doctor... a horrible creature.

12
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,930
Creature?

13
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,680
Didn't you see it? It was over in there.

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,420
It came straight towards me... covered with seaweed and foam

15
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,040
and this horrible hissing sound... and then I screamed...

16
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,590
All right, Victoria.

17
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,180
Creature?! The girl's hysterical.

18
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,920
Mr Robson, they're empty. The seals are broken.

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,380
Why were you in there?

20
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,140
I... I was hiding. I heard someone coming, so I went in.

21
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,460
This door is always kept locked. You broke in!

22
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,080
You emptied those cylinders, didn't you?

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,400
Oh, no, no. It was open and someone locked it behind me.

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,540
She's telling the truth. The door was locked from the outside.

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,880
Yes it was locked.

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,540
This room wasn't full of oxygen when we came in here.

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,260
It was another gas of a toxic composition.

28
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,440
All right, if it was a poison gas, where did it come from?

29
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,480
What about up there?

30
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,640
The ventilator's open.

31
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,020
Did you open the ventilator?

32
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,100
No, it opened by itself.

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,660
Then, whoever locked you in must have opened it. But how?

34
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,570
From here.

35
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,880
What is it, love?

36
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,020
I don't know... I feel so dazed...

37
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,140
- My hand...  - Let me see.

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,450
It looks all right. What happened?

39
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,500
I don't... remember.

40
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,770
You said you were stung or something.

41
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Did I? Why, yes...

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,860
yes, yes it must have been.

43
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,780
I went to get the file you asked for. I put my hand inside...

44
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,420
...and then... it was seaweed.

45
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,840
All right, my love...

46
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,114
...lie still and rest.

47
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,460
Shall I get you some food, a glass of milk or something?

48
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,880
Honey... you couldn't even boil an egg.

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,060
You shouldn't have married a scientist then. Maggie!

50
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,980
- Darling... darling...   - Maggie!

51
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,380
What is it, love? What's the matter?

52
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,560
I still don't know... I just feel...

53
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,055
I better get you a doctor.

54
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,346
I'll go back and see if Dr Paterson's returned yet from Rig D.

55
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,180
- Will you be all right?   - I think so.

56
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,580
Well if he isn't back, there's this other doctor, he might be able to help.

57
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,050
I won't be long.

58
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,460
So what's the panic?

59
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,130
It's the pump, sir! The revs have dropped.

60
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,160
The pump is slowing down?

61
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,840
Yes, she's not holding steady even now. I don't understand it.

62
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,200
Well don't stand there thinking about it, man, do a complete check.

63
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,020
Excuse me, may I say something?

64
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,560
When I was in the pipe room, a short while ago,

65
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,540
I'm sure I heard a movement coming from inside the pipe.

66
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,560
What kind of movement?

67
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,700
Well, the same as I heard on the beach, a sort of thumping sound.

68
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,320
But that's what they heard out at the rigs.

69
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,340
What you heard, and what everybody else heard,

70
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,600
was a mechanical fault somewhere along the line.

71
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,080
Then why did they hear it out at the rig?

72
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,560
Because, my friend, underneath this impeller shaft
is a vast sealed gasometer buried in the earth.

73
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,180
It acts like an echo chamber.

74
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,160
It'll make the sound of a pin dropping
sound like that of a thunder clap.

75
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,560
It travels along the pipes.

76
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,720
Oh, this wasn't a mechanical sound.

77
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,516
All right then, suppose there is something in the pipe, a fish or something.

78
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,740
What do you want me to do about it?

79
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,800
Turn off the gas flow. At least until you've had a chance to investigate.

80
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,700
That's out of the question.

81
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,620
Mr Robson, if there is something in the pipeline...

82
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
We do not turn off the flow, and that is final.

83
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,520
- Mr Robson, sir.   - Yes?

84
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,380
Down another half.

85
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,320
It must be a mechanical fault. Get a couple of men and check, man, check.

86
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,357
If you allow the pressure to build up in the pipeline,

87
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,540
- you'll blow the whole rig sky-high.   - And blow us with it.

88
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,360
All because you're too stubborn to turn off the gas.

89
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,580
All right, what do you think it is?

90
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,360
One of these creatures the hysterical girl thought she saw.

91
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,180
Well who knows.

92
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,260
You mean to say that this place supplies all the gas for the whole of the south of England?

93
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,180
And the whole of Wales.

94
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,810
What are all those lights for?

95
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,580
Well that's a plan of the entire compound,

96
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,440
and each of those lights represents a remote control camera

97
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,540
that I can switch through to this screen,
if I want to look at any particular area.

98
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,620
Like this.

99
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,940
Oh. Where are all these 'rigs' people talk about?

100
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,660
Well, they're out at sea of course,

101
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,620
but that plan over there shows you the relative position of all the rigs under our command.

102
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,580
What's the big one in the middle?

103
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,140
Well that's the central Control Rig complex,
the sort of the nerve centre of the whole thing.

104
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,650
The other rigs feed her with gas, and she in turn pumps it to us via the main pipeline, see.

105
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,140
How awful to have to live out at sea. And lonely.

106
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,100
Oh, I don't know.

107
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,960
Mr Robson once spent four years on one of the early rigs without ever going ashore.

108
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,800
Aye, that would account for quite a lot.

109
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,000
Hey you! Come in here and give a hand.

110
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,840
Doesn't that man ever call anyone by their name?

111
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,300
Well they'd probably be in trouble if he does.

112
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,400
No, he's all right, is Robson.

113
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,960
Certainly knows all there is to know about rigs, anyway.

114
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,780
Price!

115
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Has Doctor Paterson returned from Rig D yet?

116
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,400
No, sir.

117
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,920
- Where's your friend, the Doctor? - In there...

118
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,720
Doctor!

119
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,540
Doctor, I need your help.
It's my wife. She's very ill.

120
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,500
- Well I'm not sure that I...   - You must come.

121
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,040
He will not go with you.

122
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,570
This is an emergency, it's my wife.

123
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,140
These people are in my custody, until I decide what to do with them.

124
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,940
But my wife!

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,460
Don't bring your domestic affairs into the refinery, Harris.

126
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,400
That goes for the rest of you.

127
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,040
Mr Robson, my wife is ill. If anything happens to her, I'll...

128
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,580
All right, one hour.

129
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,060
Thank you. Doctor, please, this way.

130
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,720
- Mrs Harris?   - Yes.

131
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,960
We are maintenance controllers, madam.

132
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,280
I wonder if we might have a few words with your husband?

133
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,980
Oh, my husband isn't here, He's at the compound.

134
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,120
Oh dear, that does make it rather difficult.

135
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,220
- We've come to carry out an inspection.   - Inspection?

136
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,260
- In the Kitchen. Your husband didn't tell you?  - No.

137
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,380
Couldn't it wait until another day? I'm... I'm not feeling very well.

138
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,440
I'm sorry, madam, it has to be carried out without delay.

139
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,400
Chief Robson's instructions.

140
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,610
That man never stops giving instructions, does he?

141
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,480
Oh, I suppose you better come in then.

142
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,780
Thank you.

143
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,780
My name is Mr Oak and this is my colleague, Mr Quill.

144
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,880
Yes, well, please be quick. I'm really not very well.

145
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,440
Of course, madam. Now don't you worry about us, Mrs Harris,

146
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,220
you won't even know that we're here. Will she?

147
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,720
The bag, Mr Quill.

148
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,340
- Mr Van Lutyens.   - What is it?

149
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,530
Feed line from the Control Rig. An excessive pressure build up in the pipeline.

150
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,520
She's almost up to capacity.

151
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,220
She'll blow herself wide open.

152
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,370
So there's a build up in the pressure coming in from the rigs

153
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,560
and a drop in the pressure of the flow going out to the receiving stations.

154
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,460
There must be something interfering with the impeller itself.

155
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,680
- Mr Robson, sir.   - Yes.

156
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,360
This is from Control Rig, sir.

157
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,820
They say there's a pressure build up in their feed line, sir.

158
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,320
Right, ask them how much, will you.

159
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,760
Almost up to danger level, Mr Robson. Shall I give the order to turn off the gas?

160
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,300
- You will not, Mr Van Lutyens.   - There'll be an explosion any minute.

161
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,180
There will not be an explosion.

162
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,920
There must be, if you don't turn off the gas.

163
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,540
Open release valve, Section D, full pressure, will you?

164
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,640
What are you doing, man? It's too late for that.

165
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,080
You can't possibly release enough gas in time.

166
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,860
You want to bet, Mr Van Lutyens?

167
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,230
What are you doing in here?

168
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,440
Is there something that you want?

169
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,680
It's down. The pressure in the pipeline, it's back to normal.

170
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,120
Dank uw geluk.

171
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,740
I wouldn't have thought you could possibly have done it in the time.

172
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,260
When you have too much gas in the tube, you release it.

173
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,000
Didn't they teach you that much back at evening classes in the Hague, Mr Van Lutyens?

174
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,020
Contact Chief Baxter, Control Rig, will you? Tell him the immediate crisis is over.

175
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,710
- Oh, and err... contact the other rig chiefs.   - Right, sir.

176
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,920
But the feed out to the receiving stations is still dropping.

177
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,700
The impeller is still slowing down...

178
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,120
What's the matter with you, Van Lutyens?

179
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,640
You've been trying to teach me my job ever since you came here.

180
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,400
I've been drilling for gas in the North Sea for most of my life.

181
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,600
I don't need people like you or Harris to teach me how to do it.

182
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,980
Mr Robson, sir.

183
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:20,430
It's C Rig, sir. Can't raise them, no response at all.

184
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,920
So, the immediate crisis is over, yeah.

185
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,640
Maggie, I've brought the Doctor.

186
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,760
- Oh no it's the same...  - I smell gas!

187
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,620
There's gas in this house!

188
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,100
It's coming from in here.

189
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,600
Quick, Jamie! Jamie, the Window! Quickly! Quickly!

190
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,080
Maggie...

191
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm sorry, sir, I can't raise them.

192
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,580
There, are you pleased with what you've done?

193
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,460
I'm warning you, Van Lutyens.

194
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,280
And I warned you, but you are too, too stubborn to listen.

195
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,580
Look at the facts, man. The fact that we lose contact with two rigs.

196
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,980
Have unprecedented, inexplicable pressure variations for over three weeks.

197
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,630
So that's it. You've been talking with Harris, eh?

198
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,520
Yeah, Mr Harris did show me his figures.

199
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,720
Only because you refused to listen to him.

200
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,580
That's why I went out to the Control Rig,

201
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,380
to see if there was an explanation out there.

202
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,900
And what did you find? Nothing.

203
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,140
I'll tell you why. 'Cause there's nothing to find!

204
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,680
- All the same, Mr Harris' figures...  - Are bunk! 

205
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,951
And the rest of his upply-tapey tin-pot ideas.

206
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,380
He's still a school kid with his bits of paper and his graph and his... slide rule.

207
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,080
You think I'm going to take any notice of him?

208
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,820
I know every nut and bolt on every one of those rigs out there!

209
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,800
All right! So your prejudice prevents you from accepting Mr Harris' calculations.

210
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,600
But what about me? Do you treat my opinion with as much contempt?

211
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,500
You? You are here to offer me your expert advice,

212
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,220
but I'm not obliged to take it. I run this outfit the way I think fit.

213
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,970
Is that understood?

214
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,680
Mr Robson, the impeller. Quick, two men.

215
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,220
She's down to 140 revs. Something must be jamming it at the base.

216
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,640
Well, Mr Robson, where do we go from here?

217
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,080
- Come on, now, you have all the answers, don't you?
- Wait a minute, quiet!

218
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,310
What is it?

219
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,100
I think I can here something...

220
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,210
No, no, no. No.

221
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,840
Look, what's the matter with her?

222
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,849
Well she's in some sort of coma.

223
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,500
Possibly because of this gas - it was toxic.

224
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,900
It isn't possible there could have been a gas leak in the flat.

225
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,800
Besides, natural gas isn't toxic.

226
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,178
Well this isn't natural gas.

227
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,500
This is the gas we found when Victoria was locked in the Oxygen Room.

228
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,560
- But where could it have come from?  - I don't know. 

229
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,820
What was the matter with her before this happened?

230
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,360
Well, she said she'd been stung by some... seaweed or something.

231
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,200
Seaweed?

232
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,480
I asked her to get a file from my study, and she found the seaweed inside it.

233
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,740
- Did you put it there?   - Well no, of course not.

234
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,040
- There's no marks or abrasions.   - No.

235
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,380
Doctor? Um.

236
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,040
- What's this?  - What?

237
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,220
- Oh! - A bit of seaweed. What's it doing in here?

238
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,320
It 's still wet.

239
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,380
Perhaps it's the same sort that Maggie was talking about.

240
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,120
- Don't touch it.   - Why?

241
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,740
Well, in the first place you don't want to get stung like your wife, do you?

242
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,120
And in the second place, whoever put it in your file meant you to touch it.

243
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,643
But that's ridiculous.

244
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:36,300
Wait a minute! I was sure I put that file in my briefcase this morning,

245
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,440
but it wasn't there when I went to get it.

246
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,740
I was on my way home... when I met Maggie.

247
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,240
But why? Why should anyone want me to get stung by a piece of seaweed?

248
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,920
Well I hate the stuff. It's so slimy and horrid.

249
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,120
Och, well you've seen seaweed before, haven't you?

250
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,040
There was loads of it down by the pipeline this morning.

251
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,280
- By the pipeline?   - Aye, the place is overrun with it.

252
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,700
Well not like that, it didn't move.

253
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,300
Move?

254
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,052
I want them all checked, every remote control release valve on the line.

255
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,540
And check and double check all those circuits.

256
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,180
Excuse me, Chief, could I have a word with you please?

257
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,790
Yes of course.

258
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,910
The impeller is still not functioning, eh?

259
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,500
No it's not.

260
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,040
And that sound we heard, have you heard it again?

261
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,440
No. As Mr Robson says, it's probably just a mechanical fault.

262
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,900
- You believe that?  - Well it's really not my job to...

263
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,460
Ah! Come on, man, you're the chief engineer, the impeller is your responsibility.

264
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,660
It's not my job to formulate theories, it's Mr Robson's.

265
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,520
Robson! Robson, what's the matter with you? 
Are you frightened of him or something?

266
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,940
No, Mr Van Lutyens, I just respect his judgement.

267
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,950
Well I'm sorry Chief. Could I have a word with you in private?

268
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,060
- Well I...   - It's important.

269
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,450
Check the feed valves!

270
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,820
I've been looking at the installation plan,

271
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,920
and the ah... impeller intake is rather particular.

272
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,820
I think I know where the blockage may be.

273
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,040
All right.

274
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,560
Well this valve is at the base of the main shaft and leads directly to the intake, yeah?

275
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,660
Uhum.

276
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,840
Well as far as I can see, there is no point between that valve and the... Control Rig 

277
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,840
where a blockage could occur big enough to stop the impeller.

278
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,370
Apart from the undersea emergency valve.

279
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,200
But you've got remote control observation on those and they're free.

280
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,510
So the impeller intake must be at fault.

281
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,820
It's possible.

282
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,276
Possible, man, it's the only answer!

283
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,230
What we have to do is to go down and free that valve.

284
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,920
I'll have to check with Mr Robson.

285
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,480
Robson! Robson! What's the matter with you? Are you children?

286
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,860
Can't you do anything on your own initiative?

287
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,760
Look, I can't send men down there without his approval.

288
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,780
Can you not also blow your nose without approval?

289
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,720
Now listen to me, Mr Van Lutyens. I've worked with Mr Robson a long time.

290
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,240
We were out there on those rigs together in the early days.

291
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,100
You may think he's wrong to run this place in the way he does, but I trust him.

292
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:03,380
And I take orders from him purely because I trust his judgement. No other reason.

293
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,940
I'm sorry, Chief, I shouldn't have said that.

294
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,320
You forgive me, yeah?

295
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,420
Now what I would like you to do is to go to Mr Robson

296
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,160
and say you think we know where the blockage is,

297
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,600
and get official permission to inspect the bass of the shaft.

298
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,860
Listen, if that's your theory, that's not mine.

299
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,910
It's the only possibility.

300
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,020
Anyway, that sound you heard, it must have come from the bass of the shaft.

301
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,440
If the main valve was open it could be an echo from any one of those rigs.

302
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,620
If it is open! But you do not know that it is open,

303
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,940
and you will not know until you go down and check.

304
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,960
Well, I suppose I could put it to him.

305
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,220
You're not going to tell me that that is a mechanical fault.

306
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,720
- I'll go and see him.   - He's in his cabin.

307
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,920
Chief! What's the matter?

308
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,780
Mr Robson, that noise in the impeller, it's started again.

309
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,760
I think we should go down and check the main valve.

310
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,120
- Oh, you do, do you?   - It's right where we think the blockage is.

311
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,000
- We?   - Well, Mr Van Luty...

312
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,020
Mr Van Lutyens. I thought he'd get his nose in. Come on!

313
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,440
You lot, get back to work!

314
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,070
Van Lutyens, I want to talk to you.

315
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,490
Mr Robson, there is something alive in the pipeline.

316
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,240
You're out of your mind, there's nothing down there.

317
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,700
I promise you, sir, I did hear something.

318
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,920
You've been unnerving my crew. Now you, get out!

319
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,420
- Listen!   - That's it!

320
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,280
- Did you hear what I said?  - Now listen will you! 

321
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,706
It's down there... in the darkness...

322
00:22:27,706 --> 00:22:30,880
in the pipeline... waiting..
