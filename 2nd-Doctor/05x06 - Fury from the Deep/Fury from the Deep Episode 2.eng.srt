1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:08,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:27,752 --> 00:00:32,963
Doctor... Jamie... hurry.

3
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:37,894
Victoria! Victoria, where are you!? Victoria!

4
00:00:38,652 --> 00:00:39,510
No!

5
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:49,641
In here!

6
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,000
Gas!

7
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:54,583
Doctor!

8
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,029
What happened?

9
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:06,909
Deep breath... take deep breaths

10
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:08,811
What's going on here? Who let you three out of the cabin?

11
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:10,072
Mr Robson, in here, it's gas!

12
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:11,540
Check it then. Find out what it is

13
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:15,237
Oh, Doctor... a horrible creature.

14
00:01:15,586 --> 00:01:16,433
Creature?

15
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:27,211
Didn't you see it? It was over in there. It came straight towards me... covered with seaweed and foam and this horrible hissing sound... and then I screamed...

16
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:29,090
All right, Victoria.

17
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:30,596
Creature?! The girl's hysterical.

18
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:34,189
Mr Robson, they're empty. The seals are broken.

19
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:38,105
Why were you in there?

20
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:41,416
I... I was hiding. I heard someone coming, so I went in.

21
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:45,455
This door is always kept locked. You broke in! You emptied those cylinders, didn't you?

22
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:48,481
Oh, no, no. It was open and someone locked it behind me.

23
00:01:48,636 --> 00:01:50,816
She's telling the truth. The door was locked from the outside.

24
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:52,325
Yes it was locked.

25
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:58,288
This room wasn't full of oxygen when we came in here. It was another gas of a toxic composition.

26
00:01:58,502 --> 00:02:00,282
All right, if it was a poison gas, where did it come from?

27
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:06,256
What about up there? The ventilator's open.

28
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,894
Did you open the ventilator?

29
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:12,902
No, it opened by itself.

30
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:16,097
Then, whoever locked you in must have opened it. But how?

31
00:02:16,732 --> 00:02:17,871
From here.

32
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,043
What is it, love?

33
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:33,484
I don't know... I feel so dazed... my hand...

34
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:35,060
Let me see.

35
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:43,452
It looks all right. What happened?

36
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:47,085
I don't... remember.

37
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:49,777
You said you were stung or something.

38
00:02:50,028 --> 00:03:03,508
Did I? Why, yes... yes, yes it must have been. I went to get the file you asked for. I put my hand inside...

39
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:09,768
...and then... it was seaweed.

40
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:14,147
All right, my love...

41
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:25,292
...lie still and rest. Shall I get you some food, a glass of milk or something?

42
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:29,348
Honey... you couldn't even boil an egg.

43
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:34,148
You shouldn't have married a scientist then. Maggie!

44
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:37,572
Darling... darling... darling...

45
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:38,984
Maggie!

46
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,592
What is it, love? What's the matter?

47
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,749
I still don't know... I just feel...

48
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:21,244
I better get you a doctor. I'll go back and see if Dr Paterson's returned yet from Rig D. Will you be all right?

49
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:22,245
I think so.

50
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:28,652
Well if he isn't back, there's this other doctor, he might be able to help. I won't be long.

51
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,967
So what's the panic?

52
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:42,630
It's the pump, sir! The revs have dropped.

53
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,660
The pump is slowing down?

54
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,178
Yes, she's not holding steady even now. I don't understand it.

55
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:48,280
Well don't stand there thinking about it, man, do a complete check.

56
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:51,674
Excuse me, may I say something?

57
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:58,858
When I was in the pipe room, a short while ago, I'm sure I heard a movement coming from inside the pipe.

58
00:05:59,047 --> 00:05:59,976
What kind of movement?

59
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,761
Well, the same as I heard on the beach, a sort of thumping sound.

60
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:04,487
But that's what they heard out at the rigs.

61
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:08,972
What you heard, and what everybody else heard, was a mechanical fault somewhere along the line.

62
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:11,684
Then why did they hear it out at the rig?

63
00:06:11,869 --> 00:06:22,423
Because, my friend, underneath this impeller shaft is a vast sealed gasometer buried in the earth. It acts like an echo chamber. It'll make the sound of a pin dropping sound like that of a thunder clap. It travels along the pipes.

64
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,588
Oh, this wasn't a mechanical sound.

65
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:28,525
All right then, suppose there is something in the pipe, a fish or something. What do you want me to do about it?

66
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:32,301
Turn off the gas flow. At least until you've had a chance to investigate.

67
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:33,702
That's out of the question.

68
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:35,207
Mr Robson, if there is something in the pipeline...

69
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:37,254
We do not turn off the flow, and that is final.

70
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,563
Mr Robson, sir.

71
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:39,377
Yes?

72
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:40,955
Down another half.

73
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,942
It must be a mechanical fault. Get a couple of men and check, man, check.

74
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:45,984
If you allow the pressure to build up in the pipeline, you'll blow the whole rig sky-high.

75
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:47,142
And blow us with it.

76
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,746
All because you're too stubborn to turn off the gas.

77
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:53,743
All right, what do you think it is? One of these creatures the hysterical girl thought she saw.

78
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,340
Well who knows.

79
00:06:57,911 --> 00:07:01,749
You mean to say that this place supplies all the gas for the whole of the south of England?

80
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:03,069
And the whole of Wales.

81
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:04,814
What are all those lights for?

82
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:16,621
Well that's a plan of the entire compound, and each of those lights represents a remote control camera that I can switch through to this screen, if I want to look at any particular area. Like this.

83
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:23,784
Oh. Where are all these 'rigs' people talk about?

84
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:31,807
Well, they're out at sea of course, but that plan over there shows you the relative position of all the rigs under our command.

85
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,558
What's the big one in the middle?

86
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:44,658
Well that's the central Control Rig complex, the sort of the nerve centre of the whole thing. The other rigs feed her with gas, and she in turn pumps it to us via the main pipeline, see.

87
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:48,340
How awful to have to live out at sea. And lonely.

88
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:54,160
Oh, I don't know. Mr Robson once spent four years on one of the early rigs without ever going ashore.

89
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,313
Aye, that would account for quite a lot.

90
00:07:56,462 --> 00:07:59,735
Hey you! Come in here and give a hand.

91
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,345
Doesn't that man ever call anyone by their name?

92
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:12,118
Well they'd probably be in trouble if he does. No, he's all right, is Robson. Certainly knows all there is to know about rigs, anyway.

93
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:17,339
Price! Has Doctor Paterson returned from Rig D yet?

94
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,372
No, sir.

95
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,255
Where's your friend, the Doctor?

96
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:21,596
In there...

97
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:26,161
Doctor! Doctor, I need your help. It's my wife. She's very ill.

98
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,419
Well I'm not sure that I...

99
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:28,580
You must come.

100
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:29,842
He will not go with you.

101
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:31,379
This is an emergency, it's my wife.

102
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:33,798
These people are in my custody, until I decide what to do with them.

103
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:34,738
But my wife!

104
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,008
Don't bring your domestic affairs into the refinery, Harris. That goes for the rest of you.

105
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:44,849
Mr Robson, my wife is ill. If anything happens to her, I'll...

106
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:48,382
All right, one hour.

107
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:50,208
Come with me.

108
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:17,859
Mrs Harris?

109
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:18,808
Yes.

110
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:24,175
We are maintenance controllers, madam. I wonder if we might have a few words with your husband?

111
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,126
Oh, my husband isn't here, He's at the compound.

112
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:37,107
Oh dear, that does make it rather difficult. We've come to carry out an inspection.

113
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:38,012
Inspection?

114
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:40,042
In the Kitchen. Your husband didn't tell you?

115
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:45,772
No. Couldn't it wait until another day? I'm... I'm not feeling very well.

116
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,661
I'm sorry, madam, it has to be carried out without delay. Chief Robson's instructions.

117
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:56,870
That man never stops giving instructions, does he? Oh, I suppose you better come in then.

118
00:09:57,119 --> 00:10:08,212
Thank you. My name is Mr Oak and this is my colleague, Mr Quill.

119
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:12,884
Yes, well, please be quick. I'm really not very well.

120
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:19,502
Of course, madam. Now don't you worry about us, Mrs Harris, you won't even know that we're here. Will she?

121
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:24,581
The bag, Mr Quill.

122
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:32,479
Mr Van Lutyens.

123
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:33,669
What is it?

124
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:37,538
Feed line from the Control Rig. An excessive pressure build up in the pipeline.

125
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,352
She's almost up to capacity.

126
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:41,596
She'll blow herself wide open.

127
00:10:41,796 --> 00:10:47,266
So there's a build up in the pressure coming in from the rigs and a drop in the pressure of the flow going out to the receiving stations.

128
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,604
There must be something interfering with the impeller itself.

129
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:57,899
Mr Robson, sir.

130
00:10:58,201 --> 00:10:59,072
Yes.

131
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:03,091
This is from Control Rig, sir. They say there's a pressure build up in their feed line, sir.

132
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:04,625
Right, ask them how much, will you.

133
00:11:04,802 --> 00:11:08,066
Almost up to danger level, Mr Robson. Shall I give the order to turn off the gas?

134
00:11:08,262 --> 00:11:09,413
You will not, Mr Van Lutyens.

135
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,127
There'll be an explosion any minute.

136
00:11:11,277 --> 00:11:12,483
There will not be an explosion.

137
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:14,023
There must be, if you don't turn off the gas.

138
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,793
Open release valve, Section D, full pressure, will you?

139
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:20,765
What are you doing, man? It's too late for that. You can't possibly release enough gas in time.

140
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:24,162
You want to bet, Mr Van Lutyens?

141
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:13,731
What are you doing in here?

142
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:17,944
Is there something that you want?

143
00:14:11,557 --> 00:14:15,862
It's down. The pressure in the pipeline, it's back to normal.

144
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,703
I wouldn't have thought you could possibly have done it in the time.

145
00:14:19,948 --> 00:14:26,647
When you have too much gas in the tube, you release it. Didn't they teach you that much back at evening classes in the Hague, Mr Van Lutyens?

146
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:33,603
Contact Chief Baxter, Control Rig, will you? Tell him the immediate crisis is over. Oh, and a... contact the other rig chiefs.

147
00:14:33,814 --> 00:14:34,515
Right.

148
00:14:34,815 --> 00:14:43,179
But the feed out to the receiving stations is still dropping. The impeller is still slowing down...

149
00:14:45,227 --> 00:14:55,150
What's the matter with you, Van Lutyens? You've been trying to teach me my job ever since you came here. I've been drilling for gas in the North Sea for most of my life. I don't need people like you or Harris to teach me how to do it.

150
00:14:55,343 --> 00:15:01,538
Mr Robson, sir. It's C Rig, sir. Can't raise them, no response at all.

151
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:05,817
So, the immediate crisis is over, yeah.

152
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:08,539
Maggie, I've brought the Doctor.

153
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:10,507
Oh no it's the same...

154
00:15:10,846 --> 00:15:13,068
I smell gas! There's gas in this house!

155
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,161
It's coming from in here.

156
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:20,700
The Window, Jamie! Jamie, the window! Quickly! Quickly!

157
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,568
Maggie...

158
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:30,978
I'm sorry, sir, I can't raise them.

159
00:15:33,077 --> 00:15:35,367
There, are you pleased with what you've done?

160
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,291
I'm warning you, Van Lutyens.

161
00:15:38,498 --> 00:15:48,681
And I warned you, but you are too, too stubborn to listen. Look at the facts, man. The fact that we lose contact with two rigs. Have unprecedented, inexplicable pressure variations for over three weeks.

162
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:50,339
So that's it. You've been talking with Harris, eh?

163
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:57,726
Yeah, Mr Harris did show me his figures. Only because you refused to listen to him. That's why I went out to the Control Rig, to see if there was an explanation out there.

164
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,783
And what did you find? Nothing. I'll tell you why. 'Cause there's nothing to find!

165
00:16:01,942 --> 00:16:03,353
All the same, Mr Harris' figures...

166
00:16:03,491 --> 00:16:14,871
Are bunk! And the rest of his upply-tapey tin-pot ideas. He's still a school kid with his bits of paper and his graph and his... slide rule. You think I'm going to take any notice of him? I know every nut and bolt on every one of those rigs out there!

167
00:16:15,722 --> 00:16:22,655
All right! So your prejudice prevents you from accepting Mr Harris' calculations. But what about me? Do you treat my opinion with as much contempt?

168
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:30,975
You? You are here to offer me your expert advice, but I'm not obliged to take it. I run this outfit the way I think fit. Is that understood?

169
00:16:31,144 --> 00:16:35,300
Mr Robson, the impeller. Quick, two men.

170
00:16:37,303 --> 00:16:41,134
She's down to 140 revs. Something must be jamming it at the base.

171
00:16:54,235 --> 00:17:00,531
Well, Mr Robson, where do we go from here? Come on, now, you have all the answers, don't you?

172
00:17:00,877 --> 00:17:02,066
Wait a minute, quiet!

173
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,312
What is it?

174
00:17:05,306 --> 00:17:06,787
I think I can here something...

175
00:17:12,757 --> 00:17:14,217
No, no, no. No.

176
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,840
Look, what's the matter with her?

177
00:17:15,988 --> 00:17:20,125
Well she's in some sort of coma. Possibly because of this gas - it was toxic.

178
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:23,998
It isn't possible there could have been a gas leak in the flat. Besides, natural gas isn't toxic.

179
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:28,551
Well this isn't natural gas. This is the gas we found when Victoria was locked in the Oxygen Room.

180
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:29,825
But where could it have come from?

181
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:33,893
I don't know. What was the matter with her before this happened?

182
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:39,442
Well, she said she'd been stung by some... seaweed or something.

183
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:40,509
Seaweed?

184
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:44,325
I asked her to get a file from my study, and she found the seaweed inside it.

185
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,374
Did you put it there?

186
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,046
Well no, of course not.

187
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,451
There's no marks or abrasions.

188
00:17:49,628 --> 00:17:50,141
No.

189
00:17:50,326 --> 00:17:51,051
Doctor?

190
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,780
Um.

191
00:17:51,915 --> 00:17:52,649
What's this?

192
00:17:52,827 --> 00:17:53,817
What. Oh!

193
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:56,825
A bit of seaweed. What's it doing in here?

194
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:57,920
It's still wet.

195
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,118
Perhaps it's the same sort that Maggie was talking about.

196
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:01,047
No! Don't touch it.

197
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:01,720
Why?

198
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:09,534
Well, in the first place you don't want to get stung like your wife, do you? And in the second place, whoever put it in your file meant you to touch it.

199
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:24,841
But that's ridiculous. Wait a minute! I was sure I put that file in my briefcase this morning, but it wasn't there when I went to get it. I was on my way home... when I met Maggie. But why? Why should anyone want me to get stung by a piece of seaweed?

200
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,963
Well I hate the stuff. It's so slimy and horrid.

201
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,322
Och, well you've seen seaweed before, haven't you? There was loads of it down by the pipeline this morning.

202
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:33,266
By the pipeline?

203
00:18:33,423 --> 00:18:34,568
Aye, the place is overrun with it.

204
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,876
Well not like that, it didn't move.

205
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:38,447
Move?

206
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:55,247
I want them all checked, every remote control release valve on the line. And check and double check all those circuits.

207
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:57,889
Excuse me, Chief, could I have a word with you please?

208
00:18:58,085 --> 00:18:59,491
Yes of course.

209
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:01,610
The impeller is still not functioning, eh?

210
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:03,200
No it's not.

211
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:05,741
And that sound we heard, have you heard it again?

212
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:09,836
No. As Mr Robson says, it's probably just a mechanical fault.

213
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:11,144
You believe that?

214
00:19:11,308 --> 00:19:12,458
Well it's really not my job to...

215
00:19:12,607 --> 00:19:14,704
Ah! Come on, man, you're the chief engineer, the impeller is your responsibility.

216
00:19:14,883 --> 00:19:16,826
It's not my job to formulate theories, it's Mr Robson's.

217
00:19:17,003 --> 00:19:19,601
Robson! Robson, what's the matter with you? Are you frightened of him or something?

218
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,162
No, Mr Van Lutyens, I just respect his judgement.

219
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,657
Well I'm sorry Chief. Could I have a word with you in private?

220
00:19:27,853 --> 00:19:28,634
Well I...

221
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:29,689
It's important.

222
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:40,555
Check the feed valves!

223
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:47,680
I've been looking at the installation plan, and the ah... impeller intake is rather particular. I think I know where the blockage may be.

224
00:19:48,045 --> 00:19:48,967
All right.

225
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,538
Well this valve is at the base of the main shaft and leads directly to the intake, yeah?

226
00:19:53,814 --> 00:19:54,612
Uhum.

227
00:19:54,869 --> 00:20:01,536
Well as far as I can see there is no point between that valve and the... Control Rig where a blockage could occur big enough to stop the impeller.

228
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:03,477
Apart from the undersea emergency valve.

229
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:06,030
But you've got remote control observation on those and they're free.

230
00:20:06,215 --> 00:20:06,889
Um.

231
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:09,117
So the impeller intake must be at fault.

232
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,333
It's possible.

233
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:14,832
Possible, man, it's the only answer! What we have to do is to go down and free that valve.

234
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:16,528
I'll have to check with Mr Robson.

235
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:20,026
Robson! Robson! What's the matter with you? Are you children? Can't you do anything on your own initiative?

236
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:21,897
Look, I can't send men down there without his approval.

237
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:23,881
Can you not also blow your nose without approval?

238
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:39,312
Now listen to me, Mr Van Lutyens. I've worked with Mr Robson a long time. We were out there on those rigs together in the early days. You may think he's wrong to run this place in the way he does, but I trust him. And I take orders from him purely because I trust his judgement. No other reason.

239
00:20:40,678 --> 00:20:51,109
I'm sorry, Chief, I shouldn't have said that. You forgive me, yeah? Now what I would like you to do is to go to Mr Robson and say you think we know where the blockage is, and get official permission to inspect the bass of the shaft.

240
00:20:51,353 --> 00:20:53,355
Listen, if that's your theory, that's not mine.

241
00:20:53,531 --> 00:20:57,583
It's the only possibility. Anyway, that sound you heard, it must have come from the bass of the shaft.

242
00:20:57,746 --> 00:21:00,060
If the main valve was open it could be an echo from any one of those rigs.

243
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:04,045
If it is open! But you do not know that it is open, and you will not know until you go down and check.

244
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,326
Well, I suppose I could put it to him.

245
00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:14,093
You're not going to tell me that that is a mechanical fault.

246
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:15,373
I'll go and see him.

247
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:16,421
He's in his cabin.

248
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:20,623
Chief!

249
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:21,641
What's the matter?

250
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:26,138
Mr Robson, that noise in the impeller, it's started again. I think we should go down and check the main valve.

251
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,334
Oh, you do, do you?

252
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,706
It's right where we think the blockage is.

253
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:29,442
We?

254
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:30,791
Well, Mr Van Luty...

255
00:21:30,968 --> 00:21:33,333
Mr Van Lutyens. I thought he'd get his nose in.

256
00:21:33,498 --> 00:21:34,611
Come on!

257
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:36,549
You lot get back to work!

258
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,176
Van Lutyens, I want to talk to you.

259
00:21:39,337 --> 00:21:42,597
Mr Robson, there is something alive in the pipeline.

260
00:21:42,742 --> 00:21:44,310
You're out of your mind, there's nothing down there.

261
00:21:44,423 --> 00:21:45,691
I promise you, sir, I did hear something.

262
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:48,972
You've been unnerving my crew. Now you, get out!

263
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,844
Listen!

264
00:21:49,957 --> 00:21:50,671
That's it!

265
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:51,497
Did you hear what I said?

266
00:21:51,618 --> 00:22:06,424
Shut up and listen will you! Down there... in the darkness... waiting...
