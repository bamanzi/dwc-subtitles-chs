1
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:25,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:54,477
Very little time. You know what you must do.

3
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:55,671
Yes.

4
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:57,842
You will obey.

5
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:51,009
Rig D. Rig D. Control calling. Rig D, come in please. Rig D. Rig D. Control calling, come in please. I'm sorry sir, I can't reach them.

6
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,479
Try Rig A again.

7
00:01:53,002 --> 00:02:00,773
Rig A. Control calling Rig A... It's no good sir. That's three rigs not answering now sir.

8
00:02:01,404 --> 00:02:10,618
The men on the remaining rigs won't last under this suspense much longer. Try the guard post again and see if there's any sign of Mr. Harris... Three rigs now. What could have happened to them?

9
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:12,657
Well, can't you send someone else to investigate?

10
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:19,978
No... I don't have the authority here. I'm just their technical adviser. Mr. HARRIS is in charge. When he comes back, he might properly authorise the company helicopter for at least to take a look.

11
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,241
We can do nothing?

12
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:26,637
Nothing. Wait. Wait. Nothing.

13
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,491
It's started again.

14
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:24,132
Jamie... Jamie... Jamie... You asleep?

15
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:27,392
No. I'm just resting my eyes.

16
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:30,241
I don't know how you can with all this trouble going on.

17
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:33,540
Oh don't worry. The Doctor will work something out. He always does.

18
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:36,734
Yes. What then?

19
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:38,582
Oh what do you mean "what then?"

20
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:40,226
What do we do next?

21
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:47,812
Oh Victoria, you know better than to ask a question like that. We never know where we're going to land one place to the next. It's half the fun isn't it?

22
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,062
Is it?

23
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:53,419
Victoria, what's the matter? You've been acting very oddly ever since we got here.

24
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:55,154
Oh it's nothing. It doesn't matter.

25
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:57,243
Look if you're worried, the Doctor...

26
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,983
Jamie, I said it was nothing. Just go back to sleep.

27
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:07,487
Oh I wouldn't worry about that old bit of seaweed. The Doctor will work something out.

28
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:34,056
Will he? There's so many questions. The weed grows. Feeds off natural gas. How fast does it grow? What happens to those who... who touch it. Oh Jamie. Jamie I'm frightened.

29
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:37,084
Oh I'm sorry Victoria. Did I startle you?

30
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:37,914
Yes. Doctor...

31
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,103
Where's Jamie?

32
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:44,090
Up there. He's asleep. Nothing can wake him except a bomb dropping.

33
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:45,199
Oh good.

34
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:46,744
Doctor what's happening?

35
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:55,294
Well I'm not sure, Victoria. I'm not sure. It's so peaceful out there, isn't it?

36
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:57,632
Heard that noise again?

37
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,931
Yes.

38
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,643
Well what are they doing about it?

39
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,264
Well we'll have to wait.

40
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:08,184
Wait? But what for? For one of those awful creatures to come and attack us all?

41
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:10,201
Now Victoria, it's not as bad as all that you know.

42
00:05:10,403 --> 00:05:13,609
Isn't it? Even you don't know really how bad it is, do you?

43
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:15,161
Well no. Not exactly.

44
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:21,141
Every time we go anywhere, something awful happens. Daleks. Cybermen.

45
00:05:21,331 --> 00:05:22,152
Yeti.

46
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:31,268
Yes, the Yeti. Why can't we go anywhere pleasant? Where there's no fighting - just peace and happiness.

47
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:52,710
Mr. Robson. Mr. Robson. What are you doing down here? Have you seen my wife at all?

48
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:54,303
Your wife?

49
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:55,810
I've been searching for her.

50
00:05:57,312 --> 00:06:00,127
You'll find her Mr. Harris. Very soon.

51
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:03,053
Then you haven't seen her.

52
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:10,612
ROBSON!

53
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:28,029
If you don't mind me saying so, Mr. Van Lutyens, I think this is a very bad idea of yours. You don't know what you're up against.

54
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:29,453
Aye, you wouldn't catch me down there.

55
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:31,682
Why don't we wait till Mr. Harris comes back sir?

56
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:36,763
The only way to find out whether this weed stuff of yours is blocking the base of the impeller is to go down and have a look.

57
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:41,732
Mr. Van Lutyens, I have no authority to send my men down there...

58
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:44,092
I realize that. That's why I'm going down.

59
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,425
By yourself?

60
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:46,370
Oh yes.

61
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:50,368
I wouldn't go down... Well I hope you know what you're doing, sir.

62
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:51,801
I think so.

63
00:06:53,032 --> 00:06:55,695
I... I wish you wouldn't do this Mr. Van Lutyens.

64
00:06:55,866 --> 00:07:05,043
I can't sit about waiting any longer. I have no position of authority here. But I do have the run of the company installations. And if I can do nothing else, I... I can at least inspect the base of the impeller shaft.

65
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:10,653
Good Luck.

66
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,864
Good luck. You'll need it.

67
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:19,071
All right, lower him down.

68
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:38,041
Help me! Let me out!

69
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:52,618
Get him up!

70
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:54,984
What is it? What's happened?

71
00:08:55,172 --> 00:08:55,956
Van Lutyens is down there.

72
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:56,864
What's happened to him?

73
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,081
Oh we don't know, Victoria...

74
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:01,584
What happened? What did you see?

75
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:05,609
He's not in the shaft. He may still be down there. Let's find Mr. Harris.

76
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,776
We can't just leave him down there.

77
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,802
Oh what are we going to do?

78
00:09:08,989 --> 00:09:09,789
We've got to go after him.

79
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:10,614
Oh Doctor no.

80
00:09:10,814 --> 00:09:11,669
Oh no we're not.

81
00:09:11,961 --> 00:09:14,352
Jamie, you wouldn't want me to go down there all on my own now, would you?

82
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:17,363
Well no.

83
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:21,347
Oh Doctor, you can't, you don't know what's down there.

84
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:29,573
Ms Megan Jones... just... just leaving reception now... Right. Thank you.

85
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:31,614
Oh Mr. Harris.

86
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,961
Mr. Harris, we've been looking for you everywhere.

87
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,482
What is it Price?

88
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,811
Are you all right sir?

89
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:42,311
Yes... Just tired. Do you have any news of my wife?

90
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:44,826
No. I'm afraid not sir. You didn't find her?

91
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:47,903
Oh Mr. Harris...

92
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:48,579
Yes?

93
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:52,772
The director, Megan Jones is leaving reception on her way here now sir.

94
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,906
I see. Thank you Price. Where's Van Lutyens?

95
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:57,451
In the Impeller Area I think sir.

96
00:09:57,651 --> 00:09:58,494
All right.

97
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:06,442
This is terrible. You mean to say that they both went down that shaft?

98
00:10:06,643 --> 00:10:08,891
I couldn't stop them. They went looking for Mr. Van...

99
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:15,111
What? What has happened to him?

100
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:21,359
Mr. Harris. Thank goodness you're back. Mr. Van Lutyens went down inside the impeller shaft to find... to find what is blocking the pipe line.

101
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:22,071
Yes?

102
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:24,389
He didn't come back. Now the Doctor and the boy has gone down there...

103
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,564
They've done what?

104
00:10:26,523 --> 00:10:30,503
Get them up at once. Stop the lift.

105
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:33,170
I'm sorry sir. it's too late.

106
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:45,344
Creepy sort of place isn't it?

107
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:49,882
Jamie, that hole goes straight down to the _ down below.

108
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:55,725
Hey, isn't that Van Lutyens' torch?

109
00:10:56,774 --> 00:10:57,663
Well it must be.

110
00:10:58,087 --> 00:10:58,882
But where is he?

111
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:02,184
Shine that down here...

112
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:04,402
Give that to me.

113
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,729
Come on Doctor. Let's get out of here. I feel as if something evil is lurking down here.

114
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,740
It all seems quiet enough Ms Jones.

115
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:19,114
Of course it is. Robson's an efficient man. Why do you think I gave him control of the compound? He knows the job backwards.

116
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,453
Then why the sudden panic?

117
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:22,295
I don't know. Harris was rather vague.

118
00:11:22,585 --> 00:11:26,441
Vague? Harris said he was taking over from Robson. I wouldn't call that vague.

119
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,294
You've not met Robson have you Perkins?

120
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:29,074
No. But...

121
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:32,162
When you do, you'll realize that he's not the sort of man one pushes around.

122
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:33,531
Then what's it all about?

123
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:42,471
Just an internal squabble I'd say. Harris is a bright man. I sent him thinking he might gain from Robson's technical experience. Obviously the two haven't taken off together.

124
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:45,118
So we're pouring oil? Politics?

125
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,710
Let's go and see shall we?

126
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:50,494
JAMIE... DOCTOR.

127
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:52,669
Oh I do wish they'd hurry.

128
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,571
Is there any way we can get them up, Chief?

129
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:59,166
Well we can't use the lift in case they want to get back in a hurry. There's the ladder inside the pipeline...

130
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:00,012
Mr Harris?

131
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:01,121
Yes. What is it Price?

132
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:02,571
Megan Jones has arrived sir.

133
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,762
Oh I see. Thank you.

134
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:09,098
Chief, you'd better come with me. I'm going to need some support when I talk to Megan Jones.

135
00:12:09,258 --> 00:12:09,810
Now?

136
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,265
But what about Jamie and the Doctor?

137
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,779
There isn't a great deal we can do at the moment, I'm afraid.

138
00:12:12,897 --> 00:12:16,626
Oak, as soon as they signal, bring them up. If there's any sign of trouble, come and get me.

139
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:17,723
You can rely on us.

140
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,112
Come on Chief.

141
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:22,687
Will they be all right. I mean is it safe?

142
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,654
Oh yes Miss. Don't you worry about a thing. We'll take care of everything, won't we, Mr Quill?

143
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:39,253
Creatures? Seaweed Creatures? What do you say to that Perkins?

144
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:40,163
Oh. Well...

145
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,249
It's true.

146
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,143
You can't be serious Mr Harris.

147
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:46,291
These creatures have been seen in the refinery itself by...

148
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:48,770
By some half witted Doctor and a couple of teenagers.

149
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:50,219
And by me.

150
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:54,342
You've seen them?

151
00:12:54,511 --> 00:12:57,351
Yes, Ms Jones. I have seen them.

152
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:08,363
Harris, I understand your wife has some sort of accident. I know it must have been a considerable shock to you and I fully understand...

153
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,846
You think I'm lying. That I've been seeing things. Believe me. There are things you don't know.

154
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:18,042
I know throughout the southern regions the sea rig stations are reverting to emergency supplies. What are we going to do about it?

155
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,668
At present there is nothing we can do about it. One by one we're losing contact with the rigs out at sea.

156
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:25,800
Then I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.

157
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:30,169
All right. Have I your permission to call out air defence.

158
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:33,544
Certainly not. This is not a national emergency. Use the company helicopters.

159
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:34,852
But you don't understand...

160
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,242
Will you please do as I say?

161
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:39,437
Price.

162
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:40,263
Yes Sir.

163
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:41,599
Get me the helicopter hangar please.

164
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:42,869
Very good sir.

165
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,353
Now, Mr. Harris. I think I would like to talk with Chief Robson.

166
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:48,698
Oh I'm sorry. I think... Well he's not very well.

167
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,240
Not well? In what way?

168
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:55,890
Something's happened to him. I... That's all I can tell you.

169
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:57,917
Like what? What happened?

170
00:13:58,114 --> 00:14:03,933
I... I don't know. I just don't know.

171
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:05,961
Can you see anything?

172
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,588
No, it's too dark Jamie. Not a sign of Van Lutyens.

173
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:12,456
Well no point hanging about here.

174
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:16,812
Wait a minute.

175
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:21,055
Come on Jamie. Let's get out of here.

176
00:14:36,534 --> 00:15:23,460
çççç Text lost? Not on transcripts. çççç

177
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,676
Get us out of here. Take the lift up!

178
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:56,887
Give me your hand. You all right?

179
00:15:57,511 --> 00:15:59,253
Yes. I think so.

180
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,643
What a climb.

181
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:05,867
It's the weed. It must fill the entire shaft. It's moving too quick.

182
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:07,877
Let's get out of this place...

183
00:16:14,597 --> 00:16:15,734
Where's Victoria?

184
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:22,730
I don't know. No wonder they didn't see the lift shaft signal. There's no one here.

185
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:24,953
Victoria wouldn't desert us.

186
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:34,643
No. Unless she had been persuaded to, Jamie. I think we'd better go and look for her. Come on. You go that way. I'll go this way.

187
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:35,908
All right.

188
00:16:36,487 --> 00:16:38,710
Foam and weed on all of the rigs?

189
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,737
According to the helicopter pilot - and no sign of life at all.

190
00:16:42,565 --> 00:16:46,300
It's so fantastic. What on earth are we going to do?

191
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:48,427
Save the lives of all the men on all the other rigs.

192
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,322
How?

193
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:50,819
Give me permission to evacuate them.

194
00:16:50,995 --> 00:16:51,514
What?

195
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,717
Then we blow every one of the rigs to pieces, right out of the sea.

196
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:58,409
You must be out of your mind. Miss Jones, you can't really agree to such a thing.

197
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,588
Just a minute. We have to. The men's life is more important than any of those rigs.

198
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:03,854
The minister would never agree.

199
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:10,207
That will do Perkins. You ask me to throw years of hard work, skill and government money like that?

200
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:16,057
I'm asking you to destroy this evil that's in the sea. Before it's too late. Bomb the rigs. I implore you.

201
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:22,335
No... no. Never. You leave those rigs alone. They're mine. They're mine I tell you. Mine.

202
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,112
Robson. What's the matter with you?

203
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:36,709
Don't you see? They're getting at me. The rigs. They're mine. I built them from my own flesh and blood. They're mine. They're mine. They want to destroy everything. They think in that way they can destroy me. We won't allow.

204
00:17:37,162 --> 00:17:39,540
We? Who Robson? Who?

205
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:50,219
What? My... I... Don't know... Chief.

206
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:53,953
Are you all right Robson?

207
00:17:54,664 --> 00:18:06,551
Yes. I'm all right. I don't know... I don't know...

208
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:07,676
Robson...

209
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:09,492
Let him go. The strain must have affected his mind.

210
00:18:09,683 --> 00:18:10,879
Oh it's not that I can assure you.

211
00:18:11,077 --> 00:18:11,922
Doctor.

212
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,640
And who are you?

213
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,613
Well...

214
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:18,841
Doctor, I've almost forgotten. What about Van Lutyens? did you...

215
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:20,453
I... I'm afraid not.

216
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:22,242
Have you any idea what happened?

217
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:27,402
Yes. Jamie and I nearly joined him. The whole of the bottom of the impeller shaft is covered in weed and foam.

218
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:32,413
What happened to Mr. Van Lutyens? And Mr. Robson?

219
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,977
I'm afraid that Mr. Robson is being controlled by some force that emanates from this weed.

220
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,450
That's incredible.

221
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:49,532
That's what we said so far about everything the Doctor's told us. Each time he's been proved right. I think it's about time we started to believe him.

222
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:54,038
All right. The least we can do is listen.

223
00:18:54,629 --> 00:19:01,050
VICTORIA... VICTORIA... It's me. Jamie. Where are you?... VICTORIA.

224
00:19:01,298 --> 00:19:07,398
You think this seaweed, or what ever it is, is a living organism capable of exercising telepathic control?

225
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:08,601
Yes.

226
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:11,615
But seaweed's vegetable matter. Everyone knows that.

227
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:23,374
This is a struggle for power, Ms Jones. Matter over mind. I'm convinced all these people - Mrs Harris, Chief Robson, Mr. Van Lutyens, have all been overcome in this struggle, and goodness knows how many more people.

228
00:19:23,547 --> 00:19:25,243
Where does it get the intelligence from Doctor?

229
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:27,191
The human brain. It's parasitic.

230
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:30,465
You mean... The creature has taken over human beings.

231
00:19:30,644 --> 00:19:32,697
I don't know, but they've certainly become part of the colony.

232
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,444
Mr. Harris. Control rig...

233
00:19:34,613 --> 00:19:37,546
Control. Yes, Baxter, what is it?

234
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:40,177
Mr. Harris, for pity's sake they're all around us.

235
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:41,393
All right. What's happening.

236
00:19:41,592 --> 00:19:45,190
These things. They're everywhere... The whole... every living place.

237
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,064
Baxter. Baxter. Can you hear...?

238
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:51,221
Get us out of here. Somebody get us out of here...

239
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:56,808
Feed HQ calling Control rig. Come in please. Come in please.

240
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:12,798
VICTORIA... VICTORIA... VICTORIA.

241
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:16,450
Back to square one. She must be somewhere.

242
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:56,052
Victoria! If anything happened to you, I'd never forgive myself.

243
00:21:02,602 --> 00:21:04,602
Oh Jamie. I didn't know you cared.

244
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,376
Victoria Waterfield. You tricked me. That's not fair.

245
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:12,618
I'm not. I was unconscious.

246
00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:14,177
Yeah. What happened?

247
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:18,619
Those two engineers... they must have...

248
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:20,425
What engineers?

249
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:24,099
You know the... and the little one...

250
00:21:24,263 --> 00:21:27,286
You mean the two that were... with the...

251
00:21:27,446 --> 00:21:30,780
Yes. That's right. I don't remember. I must have passed out.

252
00:21:30,945 --> 00:21:35,364
You know the Doctor and me, we were nearly... Oh never mind about that.

253
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:41,693
Oh Jamie, why are we always getting into trouble like this? It's been every where we go.

254
00:21:42,158 --> 00:21:43,217
How do you mean?

255
00:21:44,224 --> 00:21:53,828
I don't know. I'm just fed up. I'm tired of one crisis on top of another. I just want some piece and quiet.

256
00:21:55,502 --> 00:21:58,732
Oh Victoria. Are you not happy with the Doctor and myself?

257
00:21:59,357 --> 00:22:03,036
Oh yes. Yes I am. But I just...

258
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:05,120
What's the matter...

259
00:22:05,678 --> 00:22:06,888
What's the matter?

260
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:08,338
Listen Jamie.

261
00:22:08,514 --> 00:22:09,668
What is it?

262
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,206
Can't you hear it?

263
00:22:11,738 --> 00:22:14,500
Yes but where's it coming from?

264
00:22:16,332 --> 00:22:18,070
Victoria look!

265
00:22:21,217 --> 00:22:27,681
With the Control rig gone, we can draw only once conclusion. The weed is trying to take over all the rigs and form one vast colony.

266
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,900
With what objective?

267
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:32,313
The saturation of the British Isles, and perhaps in time the entire planet.

268
00:22:32,524 --> 00:22:33,520
Is such a thing possible?

269
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:36,693
Oh yes. Unless we can find the nerve centre and destroy it.

270
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:40,125
But how can we possibly do that? It could be anywhere out there in the North Sea.

271
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:41,301
Yes. That is the difficulty.

272
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:42,031
Doctor.

273
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:42,823
What is it?

274
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:43,848
The pipeline. Quick. Come on.

275
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:44,910
Hurry.

276
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:46,067
What's happening?

277
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:46,965
It's here.

278
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:53,391
What in heaven's name is that?

279
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:56,110
The advance guard.

280
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:02,899
I don't understand... what's happening?

281
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:06,304
The first part of the invasion...

282
00:23:06,811 --> 00:23:08,110
Doctor, don't go near.

283
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:12,340
It's begun... The battle of the giants.
