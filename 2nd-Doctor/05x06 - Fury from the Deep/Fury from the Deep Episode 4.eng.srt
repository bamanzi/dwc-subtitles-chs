00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:25,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,270
Very little time. You know what you must do.

3
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,600
Yes.

4
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,640
You will obey.

5
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,200
Rig D. Rig D. Control calling. Rig D, come in please.

6
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,080
Rig D. Rig D. Control calling, come in please.

7
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,220
I'm sorry sir, I can't reach them.

8
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,760
Try Rig A again.

9
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,360
Rig A. Control calling Rig A...

10
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,140
It's no good sir. That's three rigs not answering now sir.

11
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,620
The men on the remaining rigs won't last under this suspense much longer.

12
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,130
Try the guard post again and see if there's any sign of Mr. Harris...

13
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,340
Three rigs now. What could have happened to them?

14
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,480
Well, can't you send someone else to investigate?

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,440
No... I don't have the authority here. I'm just their technical adviser.

16
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,300
Mr. HARRIS is in charge. When he comes back...

17
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,000
he might properly authorise the company helicopter for at least to take a look.

18
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,880
- We can do nothing?  - Nothing. 

19
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,400
Wait. Wait.

20
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,420
Nothing.

21
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,060
It's started again.

22
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,340
Jamie... Jamie...

23
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,320
Jamie... You asleep?

24
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,390
No. I'm just resting my eyes.

25
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,680
I don't know how you can with all this trouble going on.

26
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,480
Oh don't worry.

27
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,720
The Doctor will work something out. He always does.

28
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,430
Yes. What then?

29
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,180
Oh what do you mean "what then?"

30
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,920
What do we do next?

31
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,860
Oh Victoria, you know better than to ask a question like that. 

32
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,780
We never know where we're going to land one place to the next.

33
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,460
- It's half the fun isn't it?  - Is it?

34
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,620
Victoria, what's the matter?

35
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,020
You've been acting very oddly ever since we got here.

36
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,040
Oh it's nothing. It doesn't matter.

37
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,040
- Look if you're worried, the Doctor...  - Jamie, I said it was nothing. 

38
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,060
- Just go back to sleep.  - Aye.

39
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,140
Oh I wouldn't worry about that old bit of seaweed.

40
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,180
The Doctor will work something out.

41
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,600
Will he?

42
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,800
There's so many questions.

43
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,260
The weed grows. Feeds off natural gas.

44
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,387
How fast does it grow?

45
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,850
What happens to those who... who touch it.

46
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,200
Oh Jamie. Jamie I'm frightened.

47
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,040
Oh I'm sorry Victoria. Did I startle you?

48
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,080
Where's Jamie?

49
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,760
Up there. He's asleep.

50
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,900
- Nothing can wake him except a bomb dropping.   - Oh good.

51
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,020
Doctor what's happening?

52
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,420
Well I'm not sure, Victoria. I'm not sure.

53
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,380
It's so peaceful out there, isn't it?

54
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,200
- Heard that noise again?  - Yes.

55
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,060
Well what are they doing about it?

56
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,680
Well we'll have to wait.

57
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,400
Wait? But what for?

58
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,800
For one of those awful creatures to come and attack us all?

59
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,540
- Now Victoria, it's not as bad as all that you know.  - Isn't it? 

60
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,100
Even you don't know really how bad it is, do you?

61
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,900
Well no. Not exactly.

62
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,400
Every time we go anywhere, something awful happens.

63
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,700
- Daleks. Cybermen.   - Yeti.

64
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,180
Yes, the Yeti. Why can't we go anywhere pleasant?

65
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,600
Where there's no fighting - just peace and happiness.

66
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,560
Mr. Robson. Mr. Robson.

67
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,020
What are you doing down here?

68
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,620
Have you seen my wife at all?

69
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,320
- Your wife?   - I've been searching for her.

70
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,220
You'll find her Mr. Harris. Very soon.

71
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,050
Then you haven't seen her.

72
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,610
ROBSON!

73
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,360
If you don't mind me saying so, Mr. Van Lutyens,

74
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,620
I think this is a very bad idea of yours.

75
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,980
You don't know what you're up against.

76
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,360
Aye, you wouldn't catch me down there.

77
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,560
Why don't we wait till Mr. Harris comes back sir?

78
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,540
The only way to find out whether this weed stuff of yours...

79
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,040
is blocking the base of the impeller is to go down and have a look.

80
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,930
Mr. Van Lutyens, I have no authority to send my men down there...

81
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,290
I realize that. That's why I'm going down.

82
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,420
- By yourself?   - Oh yes.

83
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,560
I wouldn't go down...

84
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,000
- Well I hope you know what you're doing, sir.   - I think so.

85
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,380
I... I wish you wouldn't do this Mr. Van Lutyens.

86
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,890
I can't sit about waiting any longer. I have no position of authority here.

87
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,900
But I do have the run of the company installations.

88
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,420
And if I can do nothing else, I...

89
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,340
I can at least inspect the base of the impeller shaft.

90
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,100
- Tot straks.   - Good luck. You'll need it.

91
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,470
All right, lower him down.

92
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,640
Help me! Let me out!

93
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,620
Get him up!

94
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,940
- What is it? What's happened?   - Van Lutyens is down there.

95
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,280
- What's happened to him?   - Oh we don't know, Victoria...

96
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,860
What happened? What did you see?

97
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,632
He's not in the shaft. He may still be down there.

98
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,960
Let's find Mr. Harris.

99
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,170
We can't just leave him down there.

100
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,040
- Oh what are we going to do?   - We've got to go after him.

101
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,060
- Oh Doctor no.   - Oh no we're not.

102
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,750
Jamie, you wouldn't want me to go down there all on my own now, would you?

103
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Well you...err, oh, no!

104
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,520
Oh Doctor, you can't, you don't know what's down there.

105
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,560
Ms Megan Jones... just... just leaving reception now... Right. Thank you.

106
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,720
Oh Mr. Harris.

107
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,120
Mr. Harris, we've been looking for you everywhere.

108
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,440
What is it Price?

109
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,910
Are you all right sir?

110
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,920
Yes... Just tired.

111
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,560
Do you have any news of my wife?

112
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,220
No. I'm afraid not sir. You didn't find her?

113
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,580
- Oh Mr. Harris...   - Yes?

114
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,540
The director, Megan Jones is leaving reception on her way here now sir.

115
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,400
I see. Thank you Price.

116
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,480
- Where's Van Lutyens?   - In the Impeller Area I think sir.

117
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,360
All right.

118
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,620
This is terrible. You mean to say that they both went down that shaft?

119
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,760
I couldn't stop them.

120
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,240
- They went looking for Mr. Lutyens...  - What? 

121
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,040
What has happened to him?

122
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,750
Mr. Harris. Thank goodness you're back.

123
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,070
Mr. Van Lutyens went down inside the impeller shaft

124
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,680
to find... to find what is blocking the pipe line.

125
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,100
- Yes?  - He didn't come back. 

126
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,700
Now the Doctor and the boy has gone down there...

127
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,800
They've done what?

128
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,480
Get them up at once.

129
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,960
Stop the lift.

130
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,420
I'm sorry sir. it's too late.

131
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,260
Creepy sort of place isn't it?

132
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,820
Jamie, that hole goes straight down to the gasometer down below.

133
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,580
Hey, isn't that Van Lutyens' torch?

134
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,220
- Well it must be.   - But where is he?

135
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,660
Shine it down here...

136
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,140
What's happened... Oh, give it to me.

137
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,940
Come on Doctor. Let's get out of here.

138
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,020
I feel as if something evil is lurking down here.

139
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,680
It all seems quiet enough Ms Jones.

140
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,540
Of course it is. Robson's an efficient man.

141
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,190
Why do you think I gave him control of the compound?

142
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,260
He knows the job backwards.

143
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,320
- Then why the sudden panic?  - I don't know. 

144
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,460
Harris was rather vague.

145
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,780
Vague? Harris said he was taking over from Robson. I wouldn't call that vague.

146
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,320
- You've not met Robson have you Perkins?   - No. But...

147
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,260
When you do, you'll realize that he's not the sort of man one pushes around.

148
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,880
- Then what's it all about?   - Just an internal squabble I'd say.

149
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,600
Harris is a bright man. I sent him thinking he might gain from Robson's technical experience.

150
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,260
Obviously the two haven't taken off together.

151
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,440
- So we're pouring oil? Politics? - Let's go and see shall we?

152
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,600
JAMIE... DOCTOR.

153
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,860
Oh I do wish they'd hurry.

154
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
Is there any way we can get them up, Chief?

155
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,300
Well we can't use the lift in case they want to get back in a hurry.

156
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,320
There's the ladder inside the pipeline...

157
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,440
- Mr Harris?  - Yes. What is it Price?

158
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,860
- Megan Jones has a rrived sir.   - Oh I see. Thank you.

159
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,540
Chief, you'd better come with me.

160
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,700
I'm going to need some support when I talk to Megan Jones.

161
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,660
- All right.  - But what about Jamie and the Doctor?

162
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,470
There isn't a great deal we can do at the moment, I'm afraid.

163
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,540
Oak, as soon as they signal, bring them up.

164
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,160
If there's any sign of trouble, come and get me.

165
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,120
- You can rely on us.   - Come on Chief.

166
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,480
Will they be all right. I mean is it safe?

167
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,131
Oh yes Miss. Don't you worry about a thing.

168
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,680
We'll take care of everything, won't we, Mr Quill?

169
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,860
Creatures? Seaweed Creatures?

170
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,060
- What do you say to that Perkins?   - It's true.

171
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,700
You can't be serious Mr Harris.

172
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,690
These creatures have been seen in the refinery itself...

173
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,380
By some half witted Doctor and a couple of teenagers.

174
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,610
And by me.

175
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,740
You've seen them?

176
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,750
Yes, Ms Jones. I have seen them.

177
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,720
Harris, I understand your wife has some sort of accident.

178
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,100
I know it must have been a considerable shock to you

179
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,740
- and I fully understand... - You think I'm lying. That I've been seeing things.

180
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,800
Believe me. There are things you don't know.

181
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,845
I know throughout the southern regions the sea rig stations are reverting to emergency supplies.

182
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,160
What are we going to do about it?

183
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,600
At present there is nothing we can do about it.

184
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,200
One by one we're losing contact with the rigs out at sea.

185
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,420
Then I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.

186
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,980
All right. Have I your permission to call out air defence.

187
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,280
Certainly not. This is not a national emergency.

188
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,440
Use the company helicopters.

189
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,360
- But you don't understand. what's going ..  - Will you please do as I say?

190
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,020
- Price.   - Yes Sir.

191
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,480
- Get me the helicopter hangar please.   - Very good sir.

192
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,520
Now, Mr. Harris. I think I would like to talk with Chief Robson.

193
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,900
Oh I'm sorry. I think...

194
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,380
Well he's not very well.

195
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,000
- Not well? In what way?  - Something's happened to him. I... 

196
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,160
That's all I can tell you.

197
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,020
- Like what? What happened?  - I... I don't know. 

198
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,030
I just don't know.

199
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,060
Can you see anything?

200
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,680
No, it's too dark Jamie.

201
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,800
Not a sign of Van Lutyens.

202
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,700
Well no point hanging about here.

203
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Wait a minute.

204
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,300
Come on Jamie. Let's get out of here. Press the button up there!

205
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,300
HQ calling Rig D. This is Feed HQ calling Rig D. Come in, please.

206
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,980
- Can you hear me?  - It's no use, there won't be a reply.

207
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,140
Don't be a fool, man. We must keep trying.

208
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,140
If there are men out on those rigs there must be a reply.

209
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,220
If? But we don't know.

210
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,580
We've already lost contact with three of our drilling rigs.

211
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,260
And you say there is definitely something down there in the impeller shaft blocking the flow?

212
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,300
- You've checked the impeller?   - Chief?

213
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,000
It's not the impeller. I've checked every last nut and bolt.

214
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,080
Whatever it is, it's down there in that shaft.

215
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,560
Get us out of here. Take the lift up!

216
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,500
Up here. Look behind you.

217
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,180
You all right?

218
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,320
Yes. I think so.

219
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,700
- What a climb.  - It's the weed. 

220
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,080
It must fill the entire shaft

221
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,360
- It's moving too quick.  - Let's get out here in case, then.

222
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,840
- Where's Victoria?  - I don't know.

223
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,500
No wonder they didn't see the lift shaft signal. There's no one here.

224
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,240
- Victoria wouldn't desert us.  - No. 

225
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,080
Unless she had been persuaded to.

226
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,360
Jamie, I think we'd better go and look for her. Come on.

227
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,780
- You go that way. I'll go this way.   - All right.

228
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,510
Foam and weed on all of the rigs?

229
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,940
According to the helicopter pilot - and no sign of life at all.

230
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,460
It's so fantastic. What on earth are we going to do?

231
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,360
Save the lives of all the men on all the other rigs.

232
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,610
- How?   - Give me permission to evacuate them.

233
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,500
- What?   - Then we blow every one of the rigs to pieces,

234
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,580
right out of the sea.

235
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,360
You must be out of your mind.

236
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,520
Miss Jones, you can't really agree to such a thing.

237
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,842
Just a minute. We have to.

238
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,520
The men's life is more important than any of those rigs.

239
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,860
- The minister would never agree.  - That will do Perkins. 

240
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,940
You ask me to throw years of hard work, skill and government money like that?

241
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,540
I'm asking you to destroy this evil that's in the sea.

242
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,920
Before it's too late. Bomb the rigs. I implore you.

243
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,520
No... no. Never. You leave those rigs alone.

244
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,180
They're mine. They're mine I tell you. Mine.

245
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,480
Robson. What's the matter with you?

246
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,800
Don't you see? They're getting at me.

247
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,060
The rigs. They're mine.

248
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,260
I built them from my own flesh and blood. They're mine. They're mine.

249
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,300
They want to destroy everything.

250
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,500
They think in that way they can destroy me.

251
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,660
- We won't allow.  - We?

252
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,120
Who Robson? Who?

253
00:17:53,420 --> 00:18:00,220
What? My... I... Don't know...

254
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,380
Chief.

255
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,880
Are you all right Robson?

256
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:13,640
Yes. I'm all right. I don't know... I don't know...

257
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,140
- Robson...  - Let him go. 

258
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,880
The strain must have affected his mind.

259
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,960
- Oh it's not that I can assure you.   - Doctor!

260
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,200
And who are you?

261
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,480
- Well...  - Doctor, I've almost forgotten. 

262
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,540
What about Van Lutyens? did you...

263
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,300
I... I'm afraid not.

264
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,920
Have you any idea what happened?

265
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,100
Yes. Jamie and I nearly joined him.

266
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,500
The whole of the bottom of the impeller shaft is covered in weed and foam.

267
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,340
What happened to Mr. Van Lutyens? And Mr. Robson?

268
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:53,240
I'm afraid that Mr. Robson is being controlled by some force that emanates from this weed.

269
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,640
That's incredible.

270
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,520
That's what we said so far about everything the Doctor's told us.

271
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,520
Each time he's been proved right.

272
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,130
I think it's about time we started to believe him.

273
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,420
All right. The least we can do is listen.

274
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,540
VICTORIA... VICTORIA... It's me. Jamie. Where are you?.

275
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,650
VICTORIA.

276
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,700
You think this seaweed, or what ever it is,

277
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,200
- is a living organism capable of exercising telepathic control?   - Yes.

278
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,700
But seaweed's vegetable matter. Everyone knows that.

279
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,000
This is a struggle for power, Ms Jones. Matter over mind.

280
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,560
I'm convinced all these people - Mrs Harris, Chief Robson, Mr. Van Lutyens,

281
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,380
have all been overcome in this struggle,

282
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,640
and goodness knows how many more people.

283
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,820
Where does it get the intelligence from Doctor?

284
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,360
- The human brain. It's parasitic.  - You mean... 

285
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,120
The creature has taken over human beings.

286
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,520
I don't know, but they've certainly become part of the colony.

287
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,460
- Mr. Harris. Control rig...  - Hurry. Hurry. Emergency.

288
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,120
- Yes, Baxter, what is it?  - Mr. Harris, for pity's sake they're all around us.

289
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,100
- All right. What's happening.  - These things. They're everywhere...

290
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,640
They're all over every thing, in every place.

291
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,520
Baxter. Baxter. Can you hear...?

292
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,300
Argh! Get us out of here. Somebody get us out of here...

293
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,200
Feed HQ calling Control rig. Come in please. Come in please.

294
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,680
VICTORIA... VICTORIA...

295
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,120
VICTORIA.

296
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,460
Back to square one. She must be somewhere.

297
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,520
Victoria. Say something. 

298
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,860
No. No, you can't be dead.

299
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,580
Victoria! If anything happened to you, I'd never forgive myself.

300
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,140
Oh Jamie. I didn't know you cared.

301
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,120
Victoria Waterfield. You tricked me. That's not fair.

302
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,320
I'm not. I was unconscious.

303
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,240
Yeah. What happened?

304
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,010
Those two engineers... they must have...

305
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,160
What engineers?

306
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,220
You know the... and the little one...

307
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,460
You mean the two that were... with the...

308
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,240
Yes. That's right.

309
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,560
I don't remember. I must have passed out.

310
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,720
If I ever get my hands on them. 

311
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,860
You know the Doctor and me, we were nearly...

312
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,900
Oh never mind about that.

313
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,100
Oh Jamie, why are we always getting into trouble like this?

314
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,420
It's been every where we go.

315
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,760
How do you mean?

316
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,860
I don't know. I'm just fed up.

317
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,180
I'm tired of one crisis on top of another.

318
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,540
I just want some piece and quiet.

319
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,640
Oh Victoria. Are you not happy with the Doctor and myself?

320
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,920
Oh yes. Yes I am. But I just...

321
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,320
What's the matter...

322
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,580
- What's the matter?   - Listen Jamie.

323
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,780
- What is it?  - Can't you hear it?

324
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,680
That noise again.

325
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,320
Yes but where's it coming from?

326
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,020
Victoria look!

327
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,490
With the Control rig gone, we can draw only once conclusion.

328
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,540
The weed is trying to take over all the rigs and form one vast colony.

329
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,900
With what objective?

330
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,380
The saturation of the British Isles, and perhaps in time the entire planet.

331
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,220
- Is such a thing possible?  - Oh yes.

332
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,920
Unless we can find the nerve centre and destroy it.

333
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,460
But how can we possibly do that?

334
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,260
It could be anywhere out there in the North Sea.

335
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,300
Yes. That is the difficulty.

336
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,360
- Doctor.   - What is it?

337
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,840
The pipeline. Quick. Come on.

338
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,000
Hurry.

339
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,260
- What's happening? - It's here.

340
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,080
What in heaven's name is that?

341
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,810
The advance guard.

342
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,240
I don't understand...

343
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,780
What's happening?

344
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,000
The first part of the invasion...

345
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,140
Doctor, don't go near.

346
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,040
It's begun... The battle of the giants.
