1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,670
It's Robson!

3
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,960
Come in, Doctor. We've been waiting for you.

4
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,300
What do you want with me?

5
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,020
You are going to help our new masters. They need you.

6
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,920
They need me?

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,060
Jamie! Doctor!

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,940
You are going to help with the conquest of the human planet.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,220
- Jamie!  - Where are you?

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,147
Don't you realise what they've done to you?

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,140
They're trying to control your mind, man!

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,360
The mind does not exist.

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,720
It is tired. It is dead. It is obsolete.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,280
Only our new masters can offer us life.

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,980
Matter will never conquer mind! It's against the law of nature!

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,480
The body does not exist. Soon we shall all be one.

17
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,160
Jamie, hurry!

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,760
Hurry, Jamie!

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,780
You cannot escape. You must join us.

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,680
You must join us. You will join us.

21
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,290
Scream again, Victoria!

22
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,000
No... No... No...

23
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,660
No... Stop... Stop! Stop! Stop!

24
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,580
Oh Doctor!

25
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,680
Come along, it's time we got out of here.

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,080
- The door?   - Yes, should we lock him in?

27
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,357
No, no. I think it's all right now.

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,560
The helicopter's waiting, come along.

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,500
Mind the stairs. They're slippery.

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,900
Well where's the helicopter then?

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,700
I can't see anything except this awful foam.

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,220
Don't worry, Victoria, it won't hurt you.

33
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,320
There it is!

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,080
- Oh, can't he see us?   - Probably not.

35
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,920
He's probably just too scared.

36
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,449
Oh Jamie, help me get this hatchway covered.

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,240
We can't hang around here. The helicopter will never see us.

38
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,720
But we'll never get off the rig without it!

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,640
There's Robson's helicopter in there.

40
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,360
But it hasn't got a driver!

41
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,720
I've been dying to get my hands on one of those things. Come on.

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,280
Come on.

43
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,900
Oh the foam, Doctor! I can't see!

44
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,710
Don't worry, Victoria, we'll soon be out of it.

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,160
I hope you know what you're doing.

46
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,805
Well we're airborne, aren't we Jamie?

47
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,800
Anyway, ask Victoria.

48
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,500
She got kidnapped by one of these things.

49
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,160
That's the only time.

50
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,900
Now don't worry, Victoria.

51
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,400
It's a very primitive machine, you know.

52
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,060
- It should be easy to control.   - Doctor, look out!

53
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,350
- Well, that's strange.   - What?

54
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,760
Well I was always... under the impression...

55
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,780
that you couldn't loop the loop in a helicopter.

56
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,402
Switch back. Switch back. Nose down a bit.

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,540
- Right pedal down. Right rudder.  - Right rudder.

58
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,840
Not too much, not too much. Try and keep the nose on the horizon.

59
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,100
Okay... okay... now it's too much! Switch back! Switch back!

60
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,620
Switch back, you want to come up now.

61
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,860
Come on, you're getting too near the water. Much too near the water.

62
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:31,300
Switch back... switch back... pull her up... switch back!

63
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,940
Switch back quickly! You're about to hit the water.

64
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,440
Now try and keep everything centralised.

65
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,280
Okay, now pull her up. Switch back! Switch back! quickly, switch back!

66
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,560
Listen to me. Now try and keep the control central.

67
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,780
Yes, thank you so much.

68
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,700
Oh, just one thing! I've got it up all right...

69
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,320
and it should be comparatively simple to propel it forward...

70
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,340
However, how do I land it?

71
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,300
It's no good. We won't hear from the Doctor or any of them.

72
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,080
- We must evacuate the compound.  - No!

73
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,140
We said an hour. He's got... ten more minutes.

74
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,600
But even if he does come back, what good could he do?

75
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,620
The only possible weapon we could have used against the weed has been destroyed.

76
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,240
- That was your entire stock of oxygen, was it?   - Yes.

77
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,920
Right. Perkins, get onto London to the Defence Minister.

78
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,580
I want a full red alert on this now. Tell him what's happened,

79
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,300
and ask him to arrange for as many tankers of oxygen as he can muster...

80
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,140
- to be sent here immediately.  - Yes, Miss Jones.

81
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,500
They won't be in time. We must evacuate the compound!

82
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,114
The pipeline room is a mass of weed and foam.

83
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,950
You've seen how rapidly it reproduces.

84
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,680
It could swamp the entire compound at any moment. It could! But it hasn't yet!

85
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,100
- And when it...   - And until it does, we stay here!

86
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,980
And when it does attack, how do you expect to fight it? With what weapons?

87
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,160
Perhaps I can answer those questions, Mr Harris.

88
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,220
Doctor! Oh, thank heavens you're alive.

89
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,660
What about Robson, did you find him?

90
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,600
Aye, we found him all right.

91
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,260
And my wife?

92
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,280
- Well we didn't see her, no.  - No!

93
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,960
There's not much hope, is there? What can we do?

94
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,800
How can we fight this hideous thing?

95
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,480
You say there's not much hope. I believe there is!

96
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,000
But even if we succeed in fighting off the weed, what about...

97
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,560
what about those people already affected by it?

98
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,100
Well on our way back here we stopped of at the Medicare Centre.

99
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,660
The man that Jamie fought with in the corridor has almost completely recovered.

100
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,540
- What?  - Yes!

101
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,920
The weed growth on his arm has disappeared and died.

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,100
He's bemused, he's dazed, but he's alive!

103
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,060
How? Why? What killed the weed?

104
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,760
Noise! Sound vibrations.

105
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,760
How did you find out?

106
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,960
Victoria discovered it.

107
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,100
I did?

108
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,540
Well yes, you screamed.

109
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,140
I screamed?

110
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,820
It's her scream, her particular pattern of sound that does the trick!

111
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,973
So that's why the crews on the rigs spoke softly.

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,960
- The noise affected them.  - Very possibly.

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,020
Now, before you evacuate this compound, just give me one half hour.

114
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,480
Mr Harris, it is too great, sir. The entire compound is alive with seaweed.

115
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,020
Half an hour won't make that much difference. Doctor, what is it that we can do?

116
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,520
We make a noise, Miss Jones, we make an awful lot of noise!

117
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,300
It's too late, we'll never stop it now!

118
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,320
But we've got to, it may be too late!

119
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,520
It's impossible, I tell you. It's seeping in from every corner of the compound.

120
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,800
Yes, but if we can destroy the weed's nerve centre.

121
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,440
But you said yourself that you don't know where the nerve centre is.

122
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,760
But we do! It's here!

123
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,820
- That's the Control Rig.  - Precisely

124
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,980
We must generate enough sound to penetrate the Control Rig.

125
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,840
- But how will you get it there?  - That way!

126
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,240
Through the pipeline. This is a habit.

127
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,000
This is the only way to help your wife and all those other people.

128
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,550
- I realise that, but there isn't time.   - But please, just one half hour!

129
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,240
- Price.   - Sir.

130
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,820
What's happening in the pipeline room?

131
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,940
- Half an hour?   - Yes, that's about all we've got.

132
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,660
But you're right - we must try.

133
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,283
Oh, thank you.

134
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,160
Now then, Mr Price, where do all these big leads go to, um?

135
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,160
- The transmitters and loud speakers down below, sir.   - I see.

136
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,740
What's this all about, Doctor?

137
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,689
Well if we can boost this equipment to transmit enough sound down the pipeline,

138
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,760
we can destroy the weed's nerve centre.

139
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,540
But do you think this idea will work?

140
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,820
- Have you got a tape recorder or some such thing?   - Yes, I think so.

141
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,950
Victoria, I want you to scream.

142
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,500
- Scream?  - He will record it.

143
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,780
- Make a loop of it so that we can repeat it endlessly.  - Right, sir.

144
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,660
What have we got here..?

145
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,070
I hope he knows what he's doing.

146
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,820
Of course he does - I think.

147
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,840
Mr Harris, the impeller shaft. You men, quick!

148
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,300
Oh come on, Doctor!

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,220
Look, there!

150
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,720
Take these magnetised speakers and attach them to the pipeline over there.

151
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,500
- Jamie, give me a hand.  - Right, ready miss.

152
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,260
Now, scream into this. Now.

153
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,220
What now?

154
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,860
Yes, yes. There's not a moment to lose.

155
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,480
I can't. It's silly.

156
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,860
- No, no. Please...   - Oh, Doctor!

157
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,280
- What's the matter, Victoria?   - She can't scream, sir.

158
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,660
- Oh no! Oh Victoria, that's ridiculous!   - Jamie, you can't scream just like that!

159
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,620
Everything depends upon you screaming!

160
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,700
There you are. I knew you could.

161
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,680
Run! Don't just stand there!

162
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,060
Keep away from it! Keep away!

163
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,020
Shut those doors!

164
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,780
Jamie, this way.

165
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,820
- All release valves open! Quick!   - What are you doing, man?

166
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,340
I'm going to save the lives of an awful lot of people, Miss Jones.

167
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,140
Close feed lines one to six! Come on, man!

168
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,180
You mean you're giving up? You're evacuating?

169
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,600
Open your eyes, Miss Jones, can't you see what's happening?

170
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,980
We're gradually being strangled.

171
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,440
I can't risk the lives of these men here any longer.

172
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,340
Just a few more minutes, please Mr Harris.

173
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,480
- The scream is ready.  - Good!

174
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,760
- And Mr Harris...    - All right, all right, what do you want us to do?

175
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,320
Now then, I've attached the speakers to the pipeline.

176
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,620
Victoria's scream will be put through this.

177
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,040
- What... what does that do?  - Well it's a little toy of my own.

178
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,500
Together with the amplifiers, yes... it should produce a sonic laser sound wave.

179
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,160
You mean like a laser light beam?

180
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,840
Yes, passing through the pipes. It will destroy the nerve centre of the weed.

181
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,320
- Will it destroy the weed here?  - Well unfortunately no.

182
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,420
- No, we have to do battle with that ourselves.   - How?

183
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,890
- With these, Mr Price.   - With what?

184
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,020
If a weed's detected here, we simply point these at them and hope for the best.

185
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,520
Now, for heaven's sake, don't get in the way of the speakers,

186
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,760
- the sound'll cut you to pieces!   - Look there!

187
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,470
- Look at the other two. - There's another one!

188
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,320
Chief! Chief, quick!

189
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,460
Doctor, how many is that? I thought that there was only one... monster.

190
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,260
I can't get the other two.

191
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,880
It's making for the corridor.

192
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:31,940
FIXME BEGIN Oh no!
It's making for the corridor.

193
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,370
FIXME BEGIN Oh no!

194
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:32,900
How many...
FIXME BEGIN Oh no!

195
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,550
How many...

196
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,260
Chief! Chief, quick!

197
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,930
There you are, that's it.

198
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,530
Back, Chief.

199
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,770
Full Alert!

200
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:40,890
Close all doors!

201
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:41,940
Steady on.

202
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,330
I'm in charge! Close all doors!

203
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,550
Those doors won't hold!

204
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,030
Point this at the monster but don't get in the way of it.

205
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,700
LOOK OUT!

206
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,320
Back, Everybody, Back! Onto the platform.  FIXME END

207
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,270
Switch it on, man, switch it on!

208
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,040
Hold that, Jamie.

209
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,180
Which is the connector switch? The connector switch!

210
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,740
Come on! We've got to eliminate that creature.

211
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,560
Point it at the creature. Go on!

212
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,160
What's going on?

213
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,790
It's not working!

214
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,110
Give it a minute.

215
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,320
It's not working, I tell you! We're finished!

216
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,760
No! Look!

217
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,080
Behind you! Look behind you! The corridor!

218
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,810
It worked.

219
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,200
Doctor, it worked.

220
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,540
Switch off. Price! Switch off control!

221
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,300
Doctor, you've done it!

222
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,560
Price, I think you better switch off the pipeline link-up.

223
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,600
What about... the weed's nerve centre at the Control Rig?

224
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,880
Do you think we've destroyed that?

225
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,360
Why don't you go and see?

226
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,740
Mr Price.

227
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,680
- Price!   - Yes, sir.

228
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,200
Send out the company helicopters, right away, to the Control Rig.

229
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,940
- I want a full report, right away.   - Very good, sir.

230
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,480
Well Doctor, I still quite don't know what to say - except thank you.

231
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,880
Miss Jones, that will be more than sufficient.

232
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,160
I still can't believe it.

233
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,960
What's the matter, eh?

234
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,580
I don't know. I'm always frightened...

235
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,660
- Well of course.   - Oh, Doctor, I can't...

236
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,160
Doctor they're safe!

237
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,200
It's all right! They're all safe!

238
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,820
They're all safe! We've won! Isn't it marvellous?

239
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,420
Maggie! Maggie! Mr Robson, can you hear me?

240
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,700
- Yes, Mr Harris, we can.   - Yes, darling, we can hear you.

241
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,540
Good, good. Are you all well? Has the weed gone?

242
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,220
The weed? Oh yes, yes, it's gone.

243
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,120
What about Van Lutyens? I don't suppose you...

244
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,080
He's fine. He's well.

245
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,900
Darling, we're all all right, I promise you.

246
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,740
Quiet everybody, quiet!

247
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,900
Mr Robson, we're sending out one of the company helicopters to you right away.

248
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,440
You'll be back with us in less than an hour!

249
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,280
Oh, I should have listened to you in the first place, Mr Harris.

250
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,760
Oh I doubt it would have helped.

251
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,280
As it turned out, we were lucky we didn't tamper with the weed.

252
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,760
Well the next time you ask me to get something from your desk, you can do it yourself.

253
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,610
To think I wanted to keep you locked up, Doctor.

254
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,940
- Well, lots of people have tried.   - They didn't want to.

255
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,450
That was a very splendid dinner, Mrs Harris.

256
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,700
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm very tired.

257
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,060
- Oh, really. Oh, dear.   - See you in the morning, Doctor.

258
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,320
Well um, no. No, as a matter of fact, we must be on our way.

259
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,440
Oh, dear. Where are you going?

260
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,010
Well we haven't quiet decided yet.

261
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,260
Aye, even if we had it wouldn't make any difference.

262
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,260
We wouldn't get there. Not with him...

263
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,328
If you're ever around here again, do drop in.

264
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,820
And in the front gate this time, just to avoid any unfortunate incidents.

265
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,620
Bye, Mr Robson.

266
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,720
Goodbye, Mrs Harris.

267
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,880
Goodbye to you, Mr Robson.

268
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,520
Well I suppose I think it's time we went.

269
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,440
Jamie... a... Victoria...

270
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,380
Hey Victoria. Wakey, wakey.

271
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,340
What's the matter?

272
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,350
You don't want to come with us, do you, Victoria?

273
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,480
I don't know. I don't really want to leave you.

274
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,590
Well, I suspected as much.

275
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,350
Would you mind?

276
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,580
- Victoria, you can't...  - Just a minute, Jamie. 

277
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,070
You mean you want to stay here and settle down, um?

278
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,380
Well, if you want to, you must.

279
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,320
- I'm sorry.   - No that's all right.

280
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,880
Mrs Harris, I wonder if you'd mind if Victoria stayed with you for a little while.

281
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,980
- You see, she's got no parents or home and it is a bit difficult...  - Well, of course. 

282
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,760
We'd be delighted to have you for as long as you want to stay.

283
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,560
- Oh, would you?  - There. Thank you very much.

284
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,320
Jamie and I will stay for another day, just in case you want to think again.

285
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,260
- Look, we'll talk it over later...  - Now, Jamie.

286
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,100
She must make up her own mind. 

287
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,240
- It's her own life. It's her decision.   - Aye.

288
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,260
Thank you Rig D. Normal function on all channels.

289
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,580
Control checks positive. Closing down now.

290
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,320
All communications remain on standby.

291
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,450
- All right, Price?   - Oh yes, thank you, sir. Back to normal.

292
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,080
- Relief?   - Crew's on their way sir.

293
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,040
Bet you could do with a bit of shut-eye, eh?

294
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,100
Oh, I don't know, I think I'm a bit past it.

295
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,900
- Go out like a light, eh?  - Probably.

296
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,690
- Chief still here?   - Yes, in the impeller room, sir.

297
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,920
- Goodnight, Price.   - Goodnight, sir.

298
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,060
- Chief.   - Mr Robson.

299
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,180
Sound as a bell, eh?

300
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,500
Almost, sir.

301
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,280
- Almost?   - Still half a point of capacity.

302
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,590
Is it?

303
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,720
The main control valve is slightly damaged. They're working on it now.

304
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,500
Be up to our normal output in the morning.

305
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,640
- There's still one or two minor repairs to be done.   - Not tonight, Chief.

306
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,480
- Well why not?  - Get some sleep. Don't argue.

307
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,740
- Leave it to the relief.   - All right.

308
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,240
Where do you lot think you're going?

309
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,240
There's another three minutes before your relief arrives.

310
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,940
Nice to know you're back to normal, sir.

311
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,470
If I didn't know you better, Chief, I would swear you were giving me lip.

312
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,720
Oh, I wouldn't dream of doing that, sir.

313
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,820
Wouldn't you? Goodnight, Chief.

314
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,480
Goodnight, sir.

315
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,080
Are you not tired?

316
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,540
No. No, I'm fine. I'm not tired at all.

317
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,780
Do you know what the Doctor's just gone and done?

318
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,740
No.

319
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,760
He's only gone down the beach for a swim. He gets worse.

320
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,320
You're still not sure, are you?

321
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,120
Yes. But it doesn't make it any easier leaving you and the Doctor.

322
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,200
Aye, we've been together a long time now.

323
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,640
Has the Doctor said anything to you?

324
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,460
No. No. You know what he's like, he wouldn't.

325
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,430
He believes in people making up their own mind.

326
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,050
Oh, Victoria. Do you think you'll be happy here?

327
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,310
Oh, I think so. The... The Harrises are very nice people.

328
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,040
Yes, I know that, but they're not from your time, are they?

329
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,920
I wouldn't be at ease back in Victorian times.

330
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,990
I have no parents or family left there anyway.

331
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,200
Aye, that's true.

332
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,940
- Jamie!   - Yes?

333
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,210
You wouldn't go... without saying goodbye, would you?

334
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,260
Of course not.

335
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,400
That won't be till the morning anyway.

336
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,520
Goodnight, Victoria.

337
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,180
Goodnight, Jamie.

338
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,520
We can't just leave her!

339
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,540
We're not leaving her, Jamie. It was her decision to stay.

340
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,351
She'll be perfectly all right with the Harrises.

341
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,120
Now don't worry so much, Jamie.

342
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,940
I'm not, I'm just... och, come on, let's go.

343
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,020
Well, where would you like to go?

344
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,040
Hmm? I couldn't care less.

345
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,160
I was fond of her too, you know, Jamie!
