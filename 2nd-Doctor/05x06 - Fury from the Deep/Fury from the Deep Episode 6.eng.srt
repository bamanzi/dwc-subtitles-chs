1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:34,975
It's Robson!

3
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:40,268
Come in, Doctor. I've been waiting for you.

4
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,045
What do you want with me?

5
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:47,051
You are going to help our new masters. They need you.

6
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:48,046
They need me?

7
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:49,441
Jamie! Doctor!

8
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:50,480
You are going to help...

9
00:00:50,693 --> 00:00:51,339
Victoria.

10
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:52,563
...with the conquest of the human planet.

11
00:00:52,777 --> 00:00:53,691
Jamie!

12
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:54,522
Victoria!

13
00:00:54,732 --> 00:00:57,958
Don't you realise what they've done to you? They're trying to control your mind, man!

14
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:05,201
The mind does not exist. It is tired. It is dead. It is obsolete. Only our new masters can offer us life.

15
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,512
Matter will never conquer mind! It's against the law of nature!

16
00:01:08,717 --> 00:01:12,068
The body does not exist. Soon we shall all be one.

17
00:01:15,798 --> 00:01:19,788
Jamie, hurry! Hurry, Jamie!

18
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:26,061
You cannot escape. You must join us. You must join us. You will join us.

19
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:30,597
Scream again, Victoria!

20
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:38,344
No... No... No... Stop... Stop! Stop! Stop!

21
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,338
Oh Doctor!

22
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:46,230
Come along, it's time we got out of here.

23
00:01:46,788 --> 00:01:47,565
The door?

24
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:48,943
Yes, should we lock him in?

25
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:54,725
No, no. I think it's all right now. The helicopter's waiting, come along. Mind the stairs. They're slippery.

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,020
Well where's the helicopter then?

27
00:02:06,702 --> 00:02:08,921
I can't see anything except this awful foam.

28
00:02:09,107 --> 00:02:10,522
Don't worry, Victoria, it won't hurt you.

29
00:02:10,723 --> 00:02:11,623
There it is!

30
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,216
Oh, can't he see us?

31
00:02:17,418 --> 00:02:18,387
Probably not.

32
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:19,917
He's probably just too scared.

33
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:27,861
Oh Jamie, help me get this hatchway covered. We can't hang around here. The helicopter will never see us.

34
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,472
But we'll never get off the rig without it!

35
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:31,250
There's Robson's helicopter in there.

36
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:32,938
But it hasn't got a driver!

37
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:37,091
I've been dying to get my hands on one of those things. Come on. Come on.

38
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,209
Oh the foam, Doctor! I can't see!

39
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:56,013
Don't worry, Victoria, we'll soon be out of it.

40
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:07,469
I hope you know what you're doing.

41
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:14,447
Well we're airborne, aren't we Jamie? Anyway, ask Victoria. She got kidnapped by one of these things.

42
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:15,880
That's the only time.

43
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:21,542
Now don't worry, Victoria. It's a very primitive machine, you know. It should be easy to control.

44
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:23,068
Doctor, look out!

45
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:24,919
Oh, no!

46
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:22,763
Well, that's strange.

47
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:23,652
What?

48
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:27,724
Well I was always... under the impression that you couldn't loop the loop in a helicopter.

49
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,755
What?

50
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:53,350
Switch back. Switch back. Nose down a bit. Go on. Right pedal down.

51
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:54,799
Right pedal.

52
00:04:57,101 --> 00:05:43,734
Right pedal down! Not too much, not too much. Try and keep the nose on the horizon. Okay... okay... now it's too much! Switch back! Switch back! Switch back, you want to come up now. Come on, you're getting too near the water. Much too near the water. Switch back... switch back... pull her up... switch back! Switch back quickly! You're about to hit the water. Now try and keep still and let me think for a while. Okay, now pull her up. Switch back! Switch back! quickly, switch back! Listen to me. Now try and keep the control central.

53
00:05:45,962 --> 00:06:00,251
Yes, thank you so much. Oh, just one thing! I've got it up all right and it should be comparatively simple to propel it forward. However, how do I land it?

54
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,961
It's no good. We won't hear from the Doctor or any of them. We must evacuate the compound.

55
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:27,742
No! We said an hour. He's got... ten more minutes.

56
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:32,873
But even if he does come back, what good could he do? The only possible weapon we could have used against the weed has been destroyed.

57
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,781
That was your entire stock of oxygen, was it?

58
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:35,601
Yes.

59
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:45,202
Right. Perkins, get onto London to the Defence Minister. I want a full red alert on this now. Tell him what's happened and ask him to arrange for as many tankers of oxygen as he can muster to be sent here immediately.

60
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:46,146
Yes, Miss Jones.

61
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:56,190
They won't be in time. We must evacuate the compound! The pipeline room is a mass of weed and foam. You've seen how rapidly it reproduces. It could swamp the entire compound at any moment.

62
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:57,479
It could! But it hasn't yet!

63
00:06:57,645 --> 00:06:58,249
And when it...

64
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,645
And until it does, we stay here!

65
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:02,610
And when it does attack, how do you expect to fight it? With what weapons?

66
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:05,850
Perhaps I can answer those questions, Mr Harris.

67
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:09,524
Doctor! Oh, thank heavens you're alive.

68
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:11,062
What about Robson, did you find him?

69
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,664
Aye, we found him all right.

70
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:14,430
And my wife?

71
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:16,136
Well we didn't see her, no.

72
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:21,941
No! There's not much hope, is there? What can we do? How can we fight this hideous thing?

73
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:24,785
You say there's not much hope. I believe there is!

74
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:29,759
But even if we succeed in fighting off the weed, what about... what about those people already affected by it?

75
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:36,261
Well on our way back here we stopped of at the Medicare Centre. The man that Jamie fought with in the corridor has almost completely recovered.

76
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:37,002
What?

77
00:07:37,177 --> 00:07:42,731
Yes, the weed growth on his arm has disappeared and died. He's bemused, he's dazed, but he's alive!

78
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:44,628
How? Why? What killed the weed?

79
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,491
Noise! Sound vibrations.

80
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:48,960
How did you find out?

81
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:51,619
Victoria discovered it.

82
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:52,617
I did?

83
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,737
Well yes, you screamed.

84
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,506
I screamed?

85
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:59,024
It's her scream, her particular pattern of sound that does the trick!

86
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:02,183
So that's why the crews on the rigs spoke softly. The noise affected them.

87
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:06,862
Very possibly. Now, before you evacuate this compound, just give me one half hour.

88
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:10,241
Mr Harris, it is too great, sir. The entire compound is alive with seaweed.

89
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:13,469
Half an hour won't make that much difference. Doctor, what is it that we can do?

90
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:17,108
We make a noise, Miss Jones, we make an awful lot of noise!

91
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:19,119
It's too late, we'll never stop it now!

92
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:20,896
But we've got to, it may be too late!

93
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:23,721
It's impossible, I tell you. It's seeping in from every corner of the compound.

94
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,059
Yes, but if we can destroy the weed's nerve centre.

95
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,966
But you said yourself that you don't know where the nerve centre is.

96
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,186
But we do! It's here!

97
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:31,464
That's the Control Rig.

98
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,221
Precisely! We must generate enough sound to penetrate the Control Rig.

99
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:37,534
But how will you get it there?

100
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:44,257
That way! Through the pipeline. This is a habit. This is the only way to help your wife and all those other people.

101
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:45,653
I realise that, but there isn't time.

102
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:47,350
But please, just one half hour!

103
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:50,853
Price.

104
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:51,686
Sir.

105
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,792
What's happening in the pipeline room?

106
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:56,421
Half an hour?

107
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:59,463
Yes, that's about all we've got. But you're right - we must try.

108
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:07,212
Oh, thank you. Now then, Mr Price, where do all these big leads go to, um?

109
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:09,372
The transmitters and loud speakers down below, sir.

110
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,444
I see.

111
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:11,591
What's this all about, Doctor?

112
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:17,398
Well if we can boost this equipment to transmit enough sound down the pipeline, we can destroy the weed's nerve centre.

113
00:09:17,576 --> 00:09:18,851
But do you think this idea will work?

114
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:21,587
Have you got a tape recorder or some such thing?

115
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:22,661
Yes, I think so.

116
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,044
Victoria, I want you to scream.

117
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:25,755
Scream?

118
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,948
He will record it. Make a loop of it so that we can repeat it endlessly.

119
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:32,712
Right, sir. What have we got here..?

120
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,178
I hope he knows what he's doing.

121
00:09:34,362 --> 00:09:35,811
Of course he does - I think.

122
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:39,423
Mr Harris, the impeller shaft. You men, quick!

123
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,050
Oh come on, Doctor!

124
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,322
Look, there!

125
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:02,098
Take these magnetised speakers and attach them to the pipeline over there. Jamie, give me a hand.

126
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:04,812
Right, ready miss. Now, scream into this. Now.

127
00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:06,469
What now?

128
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:08,095
Yes, yes. There's not a moment to lose.

129
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,587
I can't. It's silly.

130
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:12,743
No, no. Please... please do help a little.

131
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:13,652
Oh, Doctor!

132
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,113
What's the matter, Victoria?

133
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,161
She can't scream, sir.

134
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:17,971
Oh no! Oh Victoria, that's ridiculous!

135
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:20,640
Jamie, you can't scream just like that!

136
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:23,986
Everything depends upon you screaming!

137
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:27,059
There you are. I knew you could.

138
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,930
Run! Don't just stand there!

139
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:43,164
Get out of the way, Jamie! Keep away!

140
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,077
What?

141
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:46,450
Jamie, keep away! Jamie!

142
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:02,540
All release valves open! Quick!

143
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:03,697
What are you doing, man?

144
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:08,585
I'm going to save the lives of an awful lot of people, Miss Jones. Close feed lines one to six! Come on, man!

145
00:11:09,164 --> 00:11:10,976
You mean you're giving up? You're evacuating?

146
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:16,926
Open your eyes, Miss Jones, can't you see what's happening? We're gradually being strangled. I can't risk the lives of these men here any longer.

147
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:19,550
Just a few more minutes, please Mr Harris. The scream is ready.

148
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:20,489
Good!

149
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,351
And Mr Harris...

150
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:22,670
All right, all right, what do you want us to do?

151
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:27,122
Now then, I've attached the speakers to the pipeline. Victoria's scream will be put through this.

152
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:28,254
What... what does that do?

153
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:34,627
Well it's a little toy of my own. Together with the amplifiers, yes... it should produce a sonic laser sound wave.

154
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:36,269
You mean like a laser light beam?

155
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:39,483
Yes, passing through the pipes. It will destroy the nerve centre of the weed.

156
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:40,992
Will it destroy the weed here?

157
00:11:41,197 --> 00:11:43,695
Well unfortunately no. No, we have to do battle with that ourselves.

158
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:44,410
How?

159
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:45,542
With these, Mr Price.

160
00:11:45,737 --> 00:11:46,491
With what?

161
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:56,360
If a weed's detected here, we simply point these at them and hope for the best. Now, for heaven's sake, don't get in the way of the speakers, the sound'll cut you to pieces! Look there!

162
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:58,076
Look at the other two. There's another one.

163
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,443
Chief! Chief, quick!

164
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:06,306
Doctor, how many is that? I thought that there was only one... monster.

165
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:14,122
Oh no!

166
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:15,864
I can't get the other two.

167
00:12:16,372 --> 00:12:17,541
It's making for the corridor.

168
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,159
How many...

169
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,862
Chief! Chief, quick!

170
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:22,535
There you are, that's it.

171
00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:24,131
Back, Chief.

172
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,372
Full Alert!

173
00:12:25,732 --> 00:12:26,490
Close all doors!

174
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:27,548
Steady on.

175
00:12:27,878 --> 00:12:28,932
I'm in charge! Close all doors!

176
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,150
Those doors won't hold!

177
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:32,637
Point this at the monster but don't get in the way of it.

178
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:34,307
LOOK OUT!

179
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:01,927
Back, Everybody, Back! Onto the platform.

180
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:11,379
Switch it on, man, switch it on!

181
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:14,145
Hold that, Jamie.

182
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:28,306
Which is the connector switch? The connector switch! Come on! We've got to eliminate that creature.

183
00:13:28,784 --> 00:13:31,781
Point it at the creature. Go on!

184
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:35,342
What's going on?

185
00:13:38,456 --> 00:13:39,898
It's not working!

186
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:41,217
Give it a minute.

187
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,237
It's not working, I tell you! We're finished!

188
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,265
No! Look!

189
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:07,769
Behind you! Look behind you! The corridor!

190
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:25,712
It worked.

191
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:27,691
Doctor, it worked.

192
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:32,583
Switch off. Price! Switch off control!

193
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:34,500
Doctor, you've done it!

194
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:38,098
Price, I think you better switch off the pipeline link-up.

195
00:14:38,406 --> 00:14:41,871
What about... the weed's nerve centre at the Control Rig?

196
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:43,068
What about...

197
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:44,282
Do you think we've destroyed that?

198
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:45,609
Why don't you go and see?

199
00:14:45,922 --> 00:14:46,504
Mr Price.

200
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:47,493
Right!

201
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:48,435
Price!

202
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:49,232
Yes, sir.

203
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:53,714
Send out the company helicopters, right away, to the Control Rig. I want a full report, right away.

204
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,689
Very good, sir.

205
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:59,786
Well Doctor, I still quite don't know what to say - except thank you.

206
00:15:00,092 --> 00:15:01,201
Miss Jones, that will be more than sufficient.

207
00:15:01,623 --> 00:15:02,763
I still can't believe it.

208
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:04,476
What's the matter, eh?

209
00:15:08,802 --> 00:15:11,988
I don't know. I'm always frightened...

210
00:15:12,355 --> 00:15:13,083
Well of course.

211
00:15:13,404 --> 00:15:15,245
Oh, Doctor, I can't...

212
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:16,576
It's all right.

213
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:17,561
I can't...

214
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:18,703
Doctor they're safe!

215
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:19,739
It's all right!

216
00:15:19,945 --> 00:15:20,563
I can't...

217
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:22,597
They're all safe! We've won! Isn't it marvellous?

218
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:24,828
Come along Victoria. They're safe. Come and look for yourself.

219
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,260
Maggie! Maggie! Mr, Robson, can you hear me?

220
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:30,122
Yes, Mr Harris, we can.

221
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,678
Yes, darling, we can hear you.

222
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,343
Good, good. Are you all well? Has the weed gone?

223
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,565
The weed? Oh yes, yes, it's gone.

224
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:39,447
What about Van Lutyens? I don't suppose you...

225
00:15:39,683 --> 00:15:41,853
He's fine. He's well.

226
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:43,783
Darling, we're all all right, I promise you.

227
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:56,952
Quiet everybody, quiet! Mr Robson, we're sending out one of the company helicopters to you right away. You'll be back with us in less than an hour!

228
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:12,150
Oh, I should have listened to you in the first place, Mr Harris.

229
00:16:12,342 --> 00:16:16,453
Oh I doubt it would have helped. As it turned out, we were lucky we didn't tamper with the weed.

230
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:17,368
Oh yes.

231
00:16:17,623 --> 00:16:21,165
Well the next time you ask me to get something from your desk, you can do it yourself.

232
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:24,019
To think I wanted to keep you locked up, Doctor.

233
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,395
Well, lots of people have tried.

234
00:16:25,603 --> 00:16:26,907
They didn't want to.

235
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:32,614
That was a very splendid dinner, Mrs Harris. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm very tired.

236
00:16:32,806 --> 00:16:34,179
Oh, really. Oh, dear.

237
00:16:34,346 --> 00:16:36,377
See you in the morning, Doctor.

238
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:40,851
Well um, no. No, as a matter of fact, we must be on our way.

239
00:16:41,036 --> 00:16:42,842
Oh, dear. Where are you going?

240
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:46,411
Well we haven't quiet decided yet.

241
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,961
Aye, even if we had it wouldn't make any difference. We wouldn't get there. Not with him...

242
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:57,937
If you're ever around here again, do drop in. And in the front gate this time, just to avoid any unfortunate incidents.

243
00:16:58,319 --> 00:16:59,439
Yes, well.

244
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:01,226
Bye, Mr Robson.

245
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:02,830
Goodbye, Mrs Harris.

246
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:11,783
Goodbye to you, Mr Robson. Well I suppose I think it's time we went. Jamie... a... Victoria...

247
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:14,534
Hey Victoria. Wakey, wakey.

248
00:17:16,266 --> 00:17:18,042
What's the matter?

249
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:22,050
You don't want to come with us, do you, Victoria?

250
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:25,872
I don't know. I don't really want to leave you.

251
00:17:26,168 --> 00:17:29,296
Well, I suspected as much.

252
00:17:29,522 --> 00:17:31,054
Would you mind?

253
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:32,490
Victoria, you can't...

254
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:43,011
Just a minute, Jamie. You mean you want to stay here and settle down, um? Well, if you want to, you must.

255
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,618
I'm sorry.

256
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:45,801
No that's all right.

257
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:54,483
Mrs Harris, I wonder if you'd mind if Victoria stayed with you for a little while. You see, she's got no parents or home and it is a bit difficult...

258
00:17:54,728 --> 00:17:58,123
Well of course, we'd be delighted to have you for as long as you want to stay.

259
00:17:58,329 --> 00:17:59,167
Oh, would you?

260
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:05,232
There. Thank you very much. Jamie and I will stay for another day, just in case you want to think again.

261
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:06,986
Look, we'll talk it over later...

262
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:11,739
Now, Jamie. She must make up her own mind. It's her own life. It's her decision.

263
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:12,854
Aye.

264
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:25,752
Thank you Rig D. Normal function on all channels. Control checks positive. Closing down now. All communications remain on standby.

265
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:31,798
All right, Price?

266
00:18:32,095 --> 00:18:34,055
Oh yes, thank you, sir. Back to normal.

267
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,130
Relief?

268
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,469
Crew's on their way sir.

269
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:38,341
Bet you could do with a bit of shut-eye, eh?

270
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:40,451
Oh, I don't know, I think I'm a bit past it.

271
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,024
Go out like a light, eh?

272
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:43,504
Probably.

273
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,587
Chief still here?

274
00:18:44,721 --> 00:18:46,296
Yes, in the impeller room, sir.

275
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:47,538
Goodnight, Price.

276
00:18:47,997 --> 00:18:48,944
Goodnight, sir.

277
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:57,186
Chief.

278
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:58,766
Mr Robson.

279
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:01,932
Sound as a bell, eh?

280
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,294
Almost, sir.

281
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:05,441
Almost?

282
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:07,053
Still half a point of capacity.

283
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,491
Is it?

284
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:17,263
The main control valve is slightly damaged. They're working on it now. Be up to our normal output in the morning. There's still one or two minor repairs to be done.

285
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,315
Not tonight, Chief.

286
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:19,236
Well why not?

287
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,042
Get some sleep. Don't argue. Leave it to the relief.

288
00:19:21,304 --> 00:19:22,194
All right.

289
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:25,356
Where do you lot think you're going? There's another three minutes before your relief arrives.

290
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:29,765
Nice to know you're back to normal, sir.

291
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:35,378
If I didn't know you better, Chief, I would swear you were giving me lip.

292
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:37,747
Oh, I wouldn't dream of doing that, sir.

293
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,783
Wouldn't you? Goodnight, Chief.

294
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:44,498
Goodnight, sir.

295
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:04,989
Are you not tired?

296
00:20:08,782 --> 00:20:14,845
No. No, I'm fine. I'm not tired at all.

297
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,024
Do you know what the Doctor's just gone and done?

298
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,245
No.

299
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:30,286
He's only gone down the beach for a swim. He gets worse. You're still not sure, are you?

300
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:35,982
Yes. But it doesn't make it any easier leaving you and the Doctor.

301
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:42,860
Aye, we've been together a long time now. Has the Doctor said anything to you?

302
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:48,736
No. No. You know what he's like, he wouldn't. He believes in people making up their own mind.

303
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:54,356
Oh, Victoria. Do you think you'll be happy here?

304
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:58,617
Oh, I think so. The... The Harrises are very nice people.

305
00:20:58,844 --> 00:21:01,344
Yes, I know that, but they're not from your time, are they?

306
00:21:01,611 --> 00:21:07,294
I wouldn't be at ease back in Victorian times. I have no parents or family left there anyway.

307
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,992
Aye, that's true. Oh, well.

308
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,175
Jamie!

309
00:21:16,463 --> 00:21:17,147
Yes?

310
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,514
You wouldn't go... without saying goodbye, would you?

311
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:32,475
Of course not. That won't be till the morning anyway. Goodnight, Victoria.

312
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:35,862
Goodnight, Jamie.

313
00:22:27,873 --> 00:22:29,585
We can't just leave her!

314
00:22:29,804 --> 00:22:33,694
We're not leaving her, Jamie. It was her decision to stay.

315
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,518
Oh!

316
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:45,053
She'll be perfectly all right with the Harrises. Now don't worry so much.

317
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:49,128
I'm not, I'm just... och, come on, let's go.

318
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,994
Well, where would you like to go?

319
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:53,182
Hmm? I couldn't care less.

320
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:01,780
I was fond of her too, you know, Jamie!
