1
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:11,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:34,373 --> 00:00:40,992
With the Control Rig gone we can draw only one conclusion. The weed is trying to take over all the rigs and form one vast colony.

3
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:42,404
With what objective?

4
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:45,653
The saturation of the British Isles and perhaps in time the entire planet.

5
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,089
Is such a thing possible?

6
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:50,492
Well, yes. Unless we can find the nerve centre and destroy it.

7
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:53,844
But how can we possibly do that? It could be anywhere out there in the North Sea.

8
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:55,042
Yes, that is the difficulty.

9
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:55,842
Doctor!

10
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:56,548
What is it?

11
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:57,418
Doctor! The pipeline, quick!

12
00:00:57,607 --> 00:00:58,362
Quickly! Quickly!

13
00:00:58,602 --> 00:00:59,345
What's happened?

14
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:00,843
Here! Come up!

15
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:07,403
What is heaven's name is that?

16
00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:10,114
The advanced guard.

17
00:01:11,077 --> 00:01:16,619
I don't understand. What's happening?

18
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,541
The first part of the invasion.

19
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:22,322
Doctor, don't go near!

20
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,548
It's begun. The battle of the giants!

21
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:35,995
Feed HQ calling Rig F. Feed HQ calling Rig F, can you hear me? Come in please.

22
00:01:36,782 --> 00:01:40,673
Oh Mr Harris. I can't raise any of the rigs. Not one!

23
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,860
This is unbelievable!

24
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:48,427
I'll try again, sir. Feed HQ calling Rig B. Feed HQ calling Rig B, can you hear me?

25
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:50,681
Well keep trying man!

26
00:01:50,923 --> 00:01:55,887
You're wasting your time, Miss Jones. By now all those rigs will have been taken over by the weed colony.

27
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:58,424
I don't care about the rigs. What's happened to the crews?

28
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,692
The worst, I'm afraid.

29
00:01:59,893 --> 00:02:00,811
Then we've got to destroy the rigs.

30
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:01,472
No!

31
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,438
No, we daren't do that.

32
00:02:02,613 --> 00:02:03,170
Why not?

33
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:07,254
Well that would spread this menace over a wide area and make it impossible to attack it.

34
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,511
Well what are we going to do?

35
00:02:08,748 --> 00:02:10,333
No, what is the weed going to do?

36
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:11,930
What can it do?

37
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:20,254
Well, let's think. Now I imagine that in the first place the weed was drawn up by one of the drilling rigs.

38
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:25,062
No, no, anything that comes up through the bores would be cleared by the engineers at the source, otherwise it would block the pumps.

39
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:29,582
Precisely. And the engineers who cleared it much have touched it, yes?

40
00:02:29,742 --> 00:02:32,883
Yes, so they must have been amongst the first to be controlled.

41
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:36,753
You see then, this attack, and it is an attack, follows a set pattern.

42
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:37,981
How do you mean?

43
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:40,732
Top priority people have been attacked first.

44
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:48,524
If your theory is correct, the weed now controls two people who know the entire layout and structure of this whole compound.

45
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,117
Yes, I'm very much afraid that is true.

46
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:56,824
Robson was here not long ago. We must find him and prevent them using him, for his own sake as well as ours.

47
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:58,148
Yes I agree. Price.

48
00:02:58,343 --> 00:02:58,881
Sir.

49
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:03,811
Get security to search the entire Compound. I want Mr Robson found and put under armed guard in his cabin.

50
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:04,863
Very good, sir.

51
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:08,529
Doctor! There's one thing that doesn't fit in with your theory.

52
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:09,741
Oh, and what's that?

53
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,438
When Victoria was locked in the Oxygen Room. Now she's nothing to do with the personnel here.

54
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:20,392
Yes, that's something that's being puzzling me too. But she disturbed somebody who was interfering with the oxygen supplies.

55
00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:22,323
Someone wearing a gas mask.

56
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:29,281
Now supposing that person was under the control of the weed. He was wearing a gas mask for one reason only.

57
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:33,106
Because to him pure oxygen would be toxic.

58
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:34,609
Exactly, Mr Harris.

59
00:03:34,803 --> 00:03:37,527
Well then we can use the oxygen as a weapon against the weed!

60
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:40,641
Well it's... it's only a theory at the moment.

61
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:45,081
Well as Mr Harris said before, you've been right so far. There's no reason why you shouldn't be now.

62
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:50,281
Oh, how nice to be trusted. But I only hope I am right.

63
00:04:07,242 --> 00:04:08,985
Good, see that he stays there.

64
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:09,829
Mr Harris.

65
00:04:10,012 --> 00:04:10,482
Yes?

66
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:11,589
They've found Mr Robson.

67
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:12,497
Good. Where?

68
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,305
In his cabin, lying on his bunk apparently.

69
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:15,401
Oh well, that's a relief.

70
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,713
There's a guard at the door, sir.

71
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:17,325
Good.

72
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:19,414
Mr Harris. I want to see Mr Robson.

73
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,129
Robson? But he's ill, he won't be able to put two...

74
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:22,505
I want to see him.

75
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:25,908
But you've seen him already. Surely you could see that he was in no fit state to help us in anyway.

76
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:31,664
I fully realise that, Mr Harris, but we're old friends, he might talk to me. There's just a possibility that he may know something that could help us.

77
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:37,757
I see. All right, but I'm coming with you. Robson's in an unpredictable state at the moment, he could be violent.

78
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:40,011
All right, you come too Perkins.

79
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:41,182
Yes, Miss Jones.

80
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:44,573
Oh, if anything happens, Price, anything at all, I'll be with Miss Jones in Mr Robson's cabin.

81
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:45,161
Very good, sir.

82
00:04:45,323 --> 00:04:45,731
Chief.

83
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:46,739
I'm right with you, sir.

84
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:49,995
Look, why don't you get the Minister to call up the National Defences?

85
00:04:50,143 --> 00:04:51,897
What exactly do you suppose the armed forces could do?

86
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,302
Well attack this weed, or whatever it is.

87
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:56,527
How? If we attack the rig, what about the men out there?

88
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:58,322
But we don't know that they are there.

89
00:04:58,462 --> 00:05:07,374
Equally, we don't know that they aren't. They could be prisoners, anything. Anyway, even if we blow the rigs out of the sea, there's no guarantee it will end this nightmare. It might well spread the menace, as the Doctor suggested.

90
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:08,351
This way please, Miss Jones.

91
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:09,056
Right!

92
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:12,157
And come along, Perkins. Don't look so worried, man, you might as well go home.

93
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:22,896
If you please, Harris.

94
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,118
Miss Jones, I'd rather you let me or Perkins come in with you.

95
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,299
No! Now don't fuss, Harris, I'll be perfectly all right.

96
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:57,297
Robson. Robson! John. John. It's all right John, it's me, Megan, Megan Jones.

97
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,510
Megan.

98
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,377
I want to try to help you.

99
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:09,628
Can't help. No one can help.

100
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,691
John, can you tell us what happened?

101
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:16,224
No.

102
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:22,428
John, listen to me. We can't help you unless you help us.

103
00:06:23,014 --> 00:06:25,801
Can't help, no one... can help.

104
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:31,176
Yes we can, John, if you let us. Now whatever it is that's affecting you, you've got to fight it!

105
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:32,019
Can't fight.

106
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:33,502
You've got to fight it, John!

107
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:34,369
Can't fight it.

108
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:57,235
Now come on, Robson! Robson! Now listen to me. I'm director of the board. I put you in charge of this area and I can just as easily send you back to the rigs. Do you understand me, Robson? Now pull yourself together, man!

109
00:06:59,184 --> 00:06:59,937
Megan.

110
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:01,092
Pull yourself together!

111
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:08,428
Megan... Megan... help me.. help... Help me, Megan!

112
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:09,285
John.

113
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:09,986
Help!

114
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:11,305
It's all right, John.

115
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,505
Miss Jones!

116
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,133
John, can you hear me? Can you hear me?

117
00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:27,915
It's as if he was in a trance, hypnotised. I thought for a minute he was rational.

118
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,846
I think we'd better let him rest.

119
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:53,364
Harris, is there nothing we can do to help him?

120
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:58,243
No, the Doctor couldn't help my... my wife... so I'm sure there is nothing he can...

121
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:03,707
No. No, of course not. As far as I can see the only thing to do is to destroy this weed. Come on.

122
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,837
He does look worried this time. It's beginning to give me the willies.

123
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:19,350
Yes. I wish we could go back to the TARDIS. Leave all this trouble behind.

124
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,814
We couldn't do that. You know the Doctor would never leave these people. Not while there's...

125
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:24,623
Oh I know, I know!

126
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:34,548
Oh, Victoria, you're not going to start again, are you? Look, the Doctor's got enough trouble as it is. So let him just sit and work it out. Anyway, he says there's an obvious answer to this seaweed stuff.

127
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,683
Is there? What do you mean?

128
00:08:36,878 --> 00:08:38,350
A way of fighting it.

129
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:40,659
If it's that obvious he would have thought of it by now.

130
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:41,561
Aye.

131
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:49,781
Well Doctor, have you thought of a way in which we can attack this weed?

132
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:51,603
Doctor!

133
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:56,036
Oh, Miss Jones. No, I'm afraid I haven't.

134
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:58,169
Well have you any idea what it might do next?

135
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:01,132
Well I think it has little alternative, but to attack us here.

136
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:01,962
Here!

137
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:02,816
But why?

138
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:09,949
'Cause this is the gas distribution centre. It will want to gain control of it! We must find a way of attacking its nerve centre before it does.

139
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,496
But where is the nerve centre?

140
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:12,750
That's the trouble, we don't know.

141
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:15,058
And we're not sure yet quite how to destroy it, are we?

142
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:18,182
No, but there... there is something at the back of my mind.

143
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:19,330
Well what about the oxygen?

144
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,926
Yes, that is a possibility.

145
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:23,167
Then we must put the oxygen supply room under guard.

146
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:23,998
Right!

147
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:59,584
Yes. Yes.

148
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:36,370
The whole of the oxygen store?

149
00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:38,790
Yes, sir, and there are no reserves left at all.

150
00:10:39,308 --> 00:10:41,426
They seem to be one step ahead of us all the time

151
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:47,181
Yes, I was right. Someone amongst us here is under the control of the weed.

152
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:48,980
You mean apart from Robson and Van Lutyens.

153
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:50,481
Yes, I'm afraid so.

154
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:52,772
How will we find out who they are?

155
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:54,653
Don't know, that's the difficulty.

156
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:58,873
Well, we must have a personnel check. Now there's a fingerprint file in security.

157
00:10:59,049 --> 00:10:59,555
Yes.

158
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,781
Doctor, I shall need your help.

159
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,484
Yes.

160
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:05,203
Hey you two, just a moment! Stop!

161
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,558
Hey, come back. You wont get away from me!

162
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:12,154
Careful!

163
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:37,571
Didn't know what hit him, did he?

164
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:42,540
Yes Jamie, I'm... I'm sure you're right.

165
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:46,017
There's a wee bit of power left in the old McCrimmon punch yet.

166
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,661
I'm sorry to disillusion you, Jamie, but... I don't think it was the punch that did it.

167
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,763
Mr Harris!

168
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:53,551
What is it?

169
00:11:53,744 --> 00:11:55,002
I think you better come, sir. Quickly!

170
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,622
What's the trouble?

171
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:09,899
The pipeline room.

172
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:11,301
But it's incredible

173
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,028
Why can't we do something?

174
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:17,296
We have to trust this strange Doctor. He's the only one who seems to be able to anticipate events.

175
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:19,502
Don't you think that in itself is suspect?

176
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:21,970
He's our only hope. Come on.

177
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:33,029
What's happened to it, Doctor?

178
00:12:34,073 --> 00:12:36,692
It's beginning to expand, like it did in the TARDIS.

179
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:38,770
Is there no way of stopping it?

180
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:40,711
No. I should have thought of this.

181
00:12:40,898 --> 00:12:43,139
But you mean this horrible stuff's growing all the time?

182
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,481
I'm very much afraid so!

183
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:49,891
Mr Harris, sir. Mr Harris. Mr Robson's broken out of his cabin. He's attacked the guard!

184
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,383
Doctor, look at that!

185
00:13:06,957 --> 00:13:14,044
Right, Jamie, back. Back, everyone back. Come along.

186
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,710
Miss Jones, I think it's time you went. Come along.

187
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:17,959
Where's Victoria?

188
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:18,892
She was here.

189
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:20,015
RED EMERGENCY ALERT! RED EMERGENCY ALERT!

190
00:13:20,186 --> 00:13:20,897
But, where is she?

191
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:22,206
I don't know! She was standing right beside you.

192
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:23,216
I thought she was with you!

193
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:23,969
No!

194
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,081
Hey!

195
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,102
The doors!

196
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,301
Open these doors! Open these doors!

197
00:13:32,575 --> 00:13:33,793
Let's try here, Jamie!

198
00:13:34,123 --> 00:13:35,801
They've closed too.

199
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,451
They're not, come along!

200
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:58,035
Jamie, I... the doors, they're heavy. I can't hold them! Jamie, hurry! Jamie! Jamie, come on! This way, in here. Hurry up, I can't hold them!

201
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:05,240
Now what do we do?

202
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:07,920
We must look for Victoria. You go that way, I'll go this.

203
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:09,089
All right.

204
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:56,369
Seal off the pipeline room, completely! Close the pipeline - in and out! Well come on, man, don't just stand there!

205
00:14:56,624 --> 00:15:02,032
Guards! You must find Mr Robson. Search everywhere.

206
00:16:01,214 --> 00:16:01,859
Mr Harris!

207
00:16:02,218 --> 00:16:03,068
What is it?

208
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,580
Mr Robson has just taken off.

209
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:12,799
Hey, have you seen Victoria?

210
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:13,734
No I haven't.

211
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:14,779
Look, haven't you found her yet?

212
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:15,948
No, I was hoping you had.

213
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:17,391
But she was standing right beside us...

214
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,597
No, no, no...

215
00:16:18,722 --> 00:16:20,854
Doctor, it's Robson. He's trying to get away in one of the company helicopters.

216
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:21,699
What?

217
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:24,952
I'm afraid he's got your young girl with him.

218
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:28,867
Oh no. Oh no. Can I speak to him from here?

219
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:29,928
Yes. Price, switch to RT.

220
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:30,930
Yes, sir.

221
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:31,698
This one?

222
00:16:31,817 --> 00:16:32,331
Yes.

223
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:36,487
Robson. Robson. Robson, listen to me. Can you hear me?

224
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:44,998
Robson. Come back, man, come back. Robson, don't you realise what they're trying to do to you? They're trying to control you!

225
00:16:45,174 --> 00:16:45,937
Now listen to me.

226
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:47,385
Robson. Robson.

227
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,831
Listen! Listen!

228
00:16:49,002 --> 00:17:00,430
I have the girl. She is my prisoner. She is my hostage. Do you understand? If you want her to live, come over to us. Come over to us.

229
00:17:00,648 --> 00:17:02,759
Robson. Robson!

230
00:17:02,948 --> 00:17:04,640
He's switched off, sir.

231
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,391
What did he mean come over to us?

232
00:17:07,555 --> 00:17:08,703
Well he meant exactly what he said!

233
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:09,926
You mean they want you?

234
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:11,399
Yes, they must think I'm a serious menace.

235
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:12,695
But you won't go, surely?

236
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:13,609
But of course.

237
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:15,594
But we need you here, you're our only hope.

238
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:18,129
Doctor, we can't let him take Victoria! Now we've got to do something to stop him!

239
00:17:18,294 --> 00:17:21,256
You can't go with that man, you can see he's not responsible.

240
00:17:21,426 --> 00:17:22,613
Jamie's right, we've got to go after him.

241
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:24,168
Yes, you can use the company helicopter.

242
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:26,973
Harris! If we let this man go now, what hope have we got?

243
00:17:27,123 --> 00:17:30,939
Miss Jones, I have a feeling that Mr Robson is going to lead us to the nerve centre of the colony.

244
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,429
Price, tell the helicopter crew to stand by. Doctor, come with me. I'll get you some transport.

245
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:49,903
Good! Thank you, Price. Tell them not to lose touch. Oh, and Price, the Doctor and the boy, are they airborne yet?

246
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,873
No, sir, they're just approaching the air field.

247
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:37,839
Mr Harris, sir. Mr Harris, the Doctor's airborne.

248
00:18:38,023 --> 00:18:43,383
Good! Doctor, can you see Robson.

249
00:18:44,454 --> 00:18:47,368
No, can't see anything here.

250
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:53,528
All right, listen carefully. We managed to track him on the Radar scope. He just landed on the control rig complex.

251
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:55,454
The control rig complex.

252
00:18:56,474 --> 00:18:58,362
What? Say again.

253
00:18:58,657 --> 00:19:00,761
We are proceeding there now.

254
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:13,527
What chance have they got?

255
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,041
Your guess is as good as mine.

256
00:19:15,312 --> 00:19:16,429
What do we do now?

257
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:17,223
We sit and wait.

258
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:18,263
But we can't...

259
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:21,852
If the Doctor hasn't done something within an hour, I'm evacuating the compound.

260
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,472
No...

261
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:23,657
And that's final, Miss Jones!

262
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:33,899
Jamie, there's the control rig complex.

263
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:37,688
Hey Doctor, one of those towers is all covered in white.

264
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,165
Yes, it's foam. That's the nerve centre.

265
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:51,530
Robson's helicopter.

266
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:52,161
Yes.

267
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,360
We can't land there.

268
00:19:53,503 --> 00:19:54,888
Oh yes we can, Jamie.

269
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:21,766
Come on in, the water's lovely.

270
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:34,934
Go on, Jamie.

271
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:39,762
Goodbye.

272
00:21:01,616 --> 00:21:03,360
So far so good, Jamie.

273
00:21:03,658 --> 00:21:04,857
But the driver, will he wait for us?

274
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:06,180
Oh yes, he said he'd hang around.

275
00:21:08,107 --> 00:21:09,783
Where do we go from here?

276
00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:12,641
I think we'll go down that way.

277
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:14,974
Like walking into the lion's den.

278
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:20,813
Jamie, we're already in the lion's den. What we've got to concentrate on is keeping our heads out of his mouth.

279
00:21:36,868 --> 00:21:39,892
It's very quiet. Do you think Victoria really is down here?

280
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:41,388
There's nowhere else she can be.

281
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:42,819
Aye, I suppose you're right.

282
00:21:45,106 --> 00:21:49,134
Jamie! Jamie! Now there's no element of surprise!

283
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:51,533
Jamie! Doctor!

284
00:21:51,721 --> 00:21:52,683
See I was right.

285
00:21:52,847 --> 00:21:53,830
Now, Jamie!

286
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,360
What's the matter?

287
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,920
If you were hunting, what would you do?

288
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,763
Well I'd set a... oh I see, you think it might be a trap.

289
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,602
Might be. We'll lets be cautious just in case, hey?

290
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,683
Here we go.

291
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:43,613
It's Robson!

292
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:49,067
Come in, Doctor. I've been waiting for you.
