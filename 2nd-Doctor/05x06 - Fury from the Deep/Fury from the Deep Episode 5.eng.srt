1
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:11,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,240
With the Control Rig gone we can draw only one conclusion.

3
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,160
The weed is trying to take over all the rigs and form one vast colony.

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,400
With what objective?

5
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,950
The saturation of the British Isles and perhaps in time the entire planet.

6
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,200
Is such a thing possible?

7
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,580
Well, yes. Unless we can find the nerve centre and destroy it.

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,250
But how can we possibly do that?

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,860
It could be anywhere out there in the North Sea.

10
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,020
Yes, that is the difficulty.

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,020
- Doctor!   - What is it?

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,660
- Doctor! The pipeline, quick!   - Quickly! Quickly!

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,180
- What's happened?  - Here!

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,920
Come up!

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,760
What is heaven's name is that?

16
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,600
The advanced guard.

17
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,880
I don't understand.

18
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,280
What's happening?

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,680
The first part of the invasion.

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,760
Doctor, don't go near!

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,140
It's begun. The battle of the giants!

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,560
Feed HQ calling Rig F. Feed HQ calling Rig F.

23
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,780
Can you hear me? Come in please.

24
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,270
Oh Mr Harris. I can't raise any of the rigs. Not one!

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,620
- This is unbelievable!  - I'll try again, sir.

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,280
Feed HQ calling Rig B. Feed HQ calling Rig B, can you hear me?

27
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,120
- Well keep trying man!   - You're wasting your time, Miss Jones.

28
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,760
By now all those rigs will have been taken over by the weed colony.

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,160
I don't care about the rigs. What's happened to the crews?

30
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,290
The worst, I'm afraid.

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,960
- Then we've got to destroy the rigs.   - No!

32
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,300
- No, we daren't do that.   - Why not?

33
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,764
Well that would spread this menace over a wide area

34
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,420
and make it impossible to attack it.

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,110
Well what are we going to do?

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,280
No, what is the weed going to do?

37
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,530
What can it do?

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,560
Well, let's think. Now I imagine that in the first place...

39
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,240
the weed was drawn up by one of the drilling rigs.

40
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,150
No, no, anything that comes up through the bores...

41
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,020
would be cleared by the engineers at the source,

42
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,380
otherwise it would block the pumps.

43
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,820
Precisely. And the engineers who cleared it much have touched it, yes?

44
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,080
Yes, so they must have been amongst the first to be controlled.

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,080
You see then, this attack, and it is an attack, follows a set pattern.

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,160
- How do you mean? - Top priority people have been attacked first.

47
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,380
If your theory is correct, the weed now controls two people...

48
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,360
who know the entire layout and structure of this whole compound.

49
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,420
Yes, I'm very much afraid that is true.

50
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,260
Robson was here not long ago. We must find him...

51
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,620
... and prevent them using him, for his own sake as well as ours.

52
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
- Yes I agree. Price.   - Sir.

53
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,500
Get security to search the entire Compound.

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,540
I want Mr Robson found and put under armed guard in his cabin.

55
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,440
Very good, sir.

56
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,320
Doctor! There's one thing that doesn't fit in with your theory.

57
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,360
Oh, and what's that?

58
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,520
When Victoria was locked in the Oxygen Room.

59
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,600
Now she's nothing to do with the personnel here.

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,240
Yes, that's something that's being puzzling me too.

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,460
But she disturbed somebody who was interfering with the oxygen supplies.

62
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,400
Someone wearing a gas mask.

63
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,480
Now supposing that person was under the control of the weed.

64
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,320
He was wearing a gas mask for one reason only.

65
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,260
Because to him pure oxygen would be toxic.

66
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,640
Exactly, Mr Harris.

67
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,680
Well then we can use the oxygen as a weapon against the weed!

68
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,200
Well it's... it's only a theory at the moment.

69
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,240
Well as Mr Harris said before, you've been right so far.

70
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,740
There's no reason why you shouldn't be now.

71
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:45,500
Oh, how nice to be trusted. But I only hope I am right.

72
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,680
Good, see that he stays there.

73
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,920
- Mr Harris.   - Yes?

74
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,660
- They've found Mr Robson.   - Good. Where?

75
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,760
- In his cabin, lying on his bunk apparently.  - Oh well, that's a relief.

76
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,400
- There's a guard at the door, sir.   - Good.

77
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,160
Mr Harris. I want to see Mr Robson.

78
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,780
Robson? But he's ill, he won't be able to ...

79
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,040
- I want to see him.  - But you've seen him already.

80
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,700
Surely you could see that he was in no fit state to help us in anyway.

81
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,360
I fully realise that, Mr Harris, but we're old friends, he might talk to me.

82
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,780
There's just a possibility that he may know something that could help us.

83
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,260
I see. All right, but I'm coming with you.

84
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,040
Robson's in an unpredictable state at the moment, he could be violent.

85
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,880
- All right, you come too Perkins.  - Yes, Miss Jones.

86
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,280
Oh, if anything happens, Price, anything at all,

87
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,500
- I'll be with Miss Jones in Mr Robson's cabin.   - Very good, sir.

88
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,540
- Chief.   - I'm right with you, sir.

89
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,320
Look, why don't you get the Minister to call up the National Defences?

90
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,400
What exactly do you suppose the armed forces could do?

91
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,940
Well attack this weed, or whatever it is.

92
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,460
How? If we attack the rig, what about the men out there?

93
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,700
But we don't know that they are there.

94
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,540
Equally, we don't know that they aren't.

95
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,060
They could be prisoners, anything.

96
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,220
Anyway, even if we blow the rigs out of the sea,

97
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,780
there's no guarantee it will end this nightmare.

98
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,970
It might well spread the menace, as the Doctor suggested.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,650
- This way please, Miss Jones.   - Right!

100
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,780
And come along, Perkins.

101
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,750
Don't look so worried, man, you might as well go home.

102
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,440
If you please, Harris.

103
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,980
Miss Jones, I'd rather you let me or Perkins come in with you.

104
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,100
No! Now don't fuss, Harris, I'll be perfectly all right.

105
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,403
Robson. Robson!

106
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,460
John. John.

107
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,620
It's all right John, it's me, Megan, Megan Jones.

108
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,160
Megan.

109
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,080
I want to try to help you.

110
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,500
Can't help. No one can help.

111
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,460
John, can you tell us what happened?

112
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,120
No.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,320
John, listen to me. We can't help you unless you help us.

114
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,300
Can't help, no one... can help.

115
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,520
Yes we can, John, if you let us.

116
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,720
Now whatever it is that's affecting you, you've got to fight it!

117
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,840
- Can't fight.  -  You've got to fight it, John!

118
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,900
- Can't fight it. -  Now come on, Robson! Robson!

119
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,480
Now listen to me. I'm director of the board.

120
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,200
I put you in charge of this area

121
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,340
and I can just as easily send you back to the rigs.

122
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,720
Do you understand me, Robson?

123
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,540
Now pull yourself together, man!

124
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,100
- Megan.   - Pull yourself together!

125
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,460
Megan... Megan... help me.. help...

126
00:07:04,316 --> 00:07:06,500
Help me, Megan!

127
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,740
- John.   - Help!

128
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,360
- It's all right, John.   - Miss Jones!

129
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,520
John, can you hear me? Can you hear me?

130
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,020
It's as if he was in a trance, hypnotised.

131
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,860
- I thought for a minute he was rational.   - I think we'd better let him rest.

132
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,060
Harris, is there nothing we can do to help him?

133
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,180
No, the Doctor couldn't help my... my wife...

134
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,940
so I'm sure there is nothing he can...

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,280
No. No, of course not.

136
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,940
As far as I can see the only thing to do is to destroy this weed.

137
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,980
Come on.

138
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,040
He does look worried this time. It's beginning to give me the willies.

139
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,660
Yes. I wish we could go back to the TARDIS.

140
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,640
- Leave all this trouble behind.  - We couldn't do that.

141
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,380
You know the Doctor would never leave these people.

142
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,320
- Not while there's...  - Oh I know, I know!

143
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,120
Oh, Victoria, you're not going to start again, are you?

144
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,624
Look, the Doctor's got enough trouble as it is.

145
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,160
So let him just sit and work it out.

146
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,840
Anyway, he says there's an obvious answer to this seaweed stuff.

147
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,980
Is there? What do you mean?

148
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,650
A way of fighting it.

149
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,950
If it's that obvious he would have thought of it by now.

150
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,860
Aye.

151
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,380
Well Doctor, have you thought of a way in which we can attack this weed?

152
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,200
Doctor!

153
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,630
Oh, Miss Jones. No, I'm afraid I haven't.

154
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,940
Well have you any idea what it might do next?

155
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,770
Well I think it has little alternative,

156
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,260
- but to attack us here.   - Here?!

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,340
- But why?   - 'Cause this is the gas distribution centre.

158
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,920
It will want to gain control of it!

159
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,540
We must find a way of attacking its nerve centre before it does.

160
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,090
But where is the nerve centre?

161
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,350
That's the trouble, we don't know.

162
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,650
And we're not sure yet quite how to destroy it, are we?

163
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,780
No, but there... there is something at the back of my mind.

164
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,980
- Well what about the oxygen?   - Yes, that is a possibility.

165
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,280
Then we must put the oxygen supply room under guard.

166
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,100
Right!

167
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,180
Yes. Yes.

168
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,270
The whole of the oxygen store?

169
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,690
Yes, sir, and there are no reserves left at all.

170
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,620
They seem to be one step ahead of us all the time

171
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,400
Yes, I was right.

172
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,300
Someone amongst us here is under the control of the weed.

173
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,140
You mean apart from Robson and Van Lutyens.

174
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,680
Yes, I'm afraid so.

175
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,970
How will we find out who they are?

176
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,900
Don't know, that's the difficulty.

177
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,020
Well, we must have a personnel check.

178
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,520
- Now there's a fingerprint file in security.  - Yes.

179
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,680
- Doctor, I shall need your help.   - Yes.

180
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,040
Hey you two, just a moment! Stop!

181
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,960
Hey, come back. You wont get away from me!

182
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,350
Careful!

183
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,380
Didn't know what hit him, did he?

184
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,340
Yes Jamie, I'm... I'm sure you're right.

185
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,920
There's a wee bit of power left in the old McCrimmon punch yet.

186
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,710
I'm sorry to disillusion you, Jamie, but...

187
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,440
I don't think it was the punch that did it.

188
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,240
- Mr Harris!   - What is it?

189
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,660
I think you better come, sir. Quickly!

190
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,020
- What's the trouble?  - The pipeline room.

191
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,160
- But it's incredible   - Why can't we do something?

192
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,380
We have to trust this strange Doctor.

193
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,790
He's the only one who seems to be able to anticipate events.

194
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,000
Don't you think that in itself is suspect?

195
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,470
He's our only hope. Come on.

196
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,680
What's happened to it, Doctor?

197
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,560
It's beginning to expand, like it did in the TARDIS.

198
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,270
Is there no way of stopping it?

199
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,600
No. I should have thought of this.

200
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,880
But you mean this horrible stuff's growing all the time?

201
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,220
I'm very much afraid so!

202
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,400
Mr Harris, sir. Mr Harris. Mr Robson's broken out of his cabin.

203
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,840
He's attacked the guard!

204
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,580
Doctor, look at that!

205
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,200
Right, Jamie, back. Back, everyone back. Come along.

206
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,160
Miss Jones, I think it's time you went. Come along.

207
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:20,610
FIXME RED EMERGENCY ALERT! RED EMERGENCY ALERT!

208
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,100
- Where's Victoria?   - She was here.
FIXME RED EMERGENCY ALERT! RED EMERGENCY ALERT!

209
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,520
FIXME RED EMERGENCY ALERT! RED EMERGENCY ALERT!

210
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,300
FIXME But, where is she?
FIXME RED EMERGENCY ALERT! RED EMERGENCY ALERT!

211
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,290
FIXME But, where is she?

212
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,600
FIXME I don't know! She was standing right beside you.

213
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,360
- I thought she was with you!   - No!

214
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,480
Hey!

215
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,500
The doors!

216
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,860
Open these doors! Open these doors!

217
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,490
Let's try here, Jamie!

218
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,300
They've closed too.

219
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,860
They're not, come along!

220
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,037
FIXME Jamie, I... the doors, they're heavy.

221
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,480
I can't hold them! Jamie, hurry!

222
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,000
Jamie! Jamie, come on!

223
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,120
- Where?  - This way, in here.

224
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,730
Hurry up, I can't hold them!

225
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,180
Now what do we do?

226
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,060
We must look for Victoria. You go that way, I'll go this.

227
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,100
All right.

228
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,080
Seal off the pipeline room, completely!

229
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,020
Close the pipeline - in and out!

230
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,980
Well come on, man, don't just stand there!

231
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,938
Guards! You must find Mr Robson.

232
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,160
Search everywhere.

233
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,840
- Mr Harris!   - What is it?

234
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,340
Mr Robson has just taken off.

235
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,120
- Hey, have you seen Victoria?   - No I haven't.

236
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,860
- Look, haven't you found her yet?   - No, I was hoping you had.

237
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,780
- But she was standing right beside us...   - No, no, no...

238
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,540
Doctor, it's Robson. He's trying to get away in one of the company helicopters.

239
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,290
What?

240
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,850
I'm afraid he's got your young girl with him.

241
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,340
Oh no. Oh no.

242
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,000
- Can I speak to him from here?   - Yes. Price, switch to RT.

243
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,340
- This one, please.  - Robson. Robson.

244
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,620
Robson, listen to me. Can you hear me?

245
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,120
Robson. Come back, man, come back.

246
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,180
Robson, don't you realise what they're trying to do to you?

247
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,060
They're trying to control you!

248
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,980
- Now listen to me.   - Robson.

249
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,400
Listen! Listen!

250
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,480
I have the girl. She is my prisoner. She is my hostage.

251
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,000
Do you understand?

252
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,560
If you want her to live, come over to us.

253
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,820
- Come over to us.  - Robson. Robson!

254
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,540
He's switched off, sir.

255
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,740
What did he mean come over to us?

256
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,060
- Well he meant exactly what he said!   - You mean they want you?

257
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,860
Yes, they must think I'm a serious menace.

258
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,800
- But you won't go, surely? - But of course.

259
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,880
But we need you here, you're our only hope.

260
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,360
Doctor, we can't let him take Victoria!

261
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,700
Now we've got to do something to stop him!

262
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,840
You can't go with that man, you can see he's not responsible.

263
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,040
Jamie's right, we've got to go after him.

264
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,800
Yes, you can use the company helicopter.

265
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,620
Harris! If we let this man go now, what hope have we got?

266
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,440
Miss Jones, I have a feeling that ...

267
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,820
Mr Robson is going to lead us to the nerve centre of the colony.

268
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,380
Price, tell the helicopter crew to stand by.

269
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,080
Doctor, come with me. I'll get you some transport.

270
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,250
Good! Thank you, Price. Tell them not to lose touch.

271
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,060
Oh, and Price, the Doctor and the boy, are they airborne yet?

272
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,220
No, sir, they're just approaching the air field.

273
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,980
Mr Harris, sir. Mr Harris, the Doctor's airborne.

274
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Doctor, can you see Robson?

275
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,060
No, can't see anything here.

276
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,340
All right, listen carefully. We managed to track him on the Radar scope.

277
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,220
He just landed on the control rig complex.

278
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,560
The control rig complex.

279
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,060
What? Say again.

280
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,640
We are proceeding there now.

281
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,560
What chance have they got?

282
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,040
Your guess is as good as mine.

283
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,400
- What do we do now?   - We sit and wait.

284
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,560
- But we can't...  - If the Doctor hasn't done something within an hour...

285
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,160
I'm evacuating the compound.

286
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,680
- No...   - And that's final, Miss Jones!

287
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,890
Jamie, there's the control rig complex.

288
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,060
Hey Doctor, one of those towers is all covered in white.

289
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,160
Yes, it's foam. That's the nerve centre.

290
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,660
- Robson's helicopter.   - Yes.

291
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,660
- We can't land there.   - Oh yes we can, Jamie.

292
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,760
Come on in, the water's lovely.

293
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,780
Go on, Jamie.

294
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,840
Goodbye.

295
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,860
So far so good, Jamie.

296
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,680
But the driver, will he wait for us?

297
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,480
Oh yes, he said he'd hang around.

298
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,280
Where do we go from here?

299
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,140
I think we'll go down that way.

300
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,640
Like walking into the lion's den.

301
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,420
Jamie, we're already in the lion's den.

302
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,900
What we've got to concentrate on is keeping our heads out of his mouth.

303
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,960
It's very quiet. Do you think Victoria really is down here?

304
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,400
There's nowhere else she can be.

305
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,760
Aye, I suppose you're right.

306
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,930
Jamie! Jamie! Now there's no element of surprise!

307
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,330
Jamie! Doctor!

308
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,780
See I was right.

309
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,160
- Now, Jamie!   - What's the matter?

310
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,020
If you were hunting, what would you do?

311
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,440
Well I'd set a... oh I see, you think it might be a trap.

312
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,780
Might be. We'll lets be cautious just in case, hey?

313
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,080
Here we go.

314
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,100
It's Robson!

315
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,060
Come in, Doctor. I've been waiting for you.
