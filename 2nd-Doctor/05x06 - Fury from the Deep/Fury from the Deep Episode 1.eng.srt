1
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:13,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,080
There Victoria, up you get.

3
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,640
Trust you to bring us right down in the middle of the sea.

4
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,620
The TARDIS is perfectly capable of floating you know.

5
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,190
Where are we exactly?

6
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,740
Oh England undoubtedly.

7
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,340
Aye, you can tell by the weather.

8
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,790
And by the cliffs.

9
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,090
We always seem to land on this planet.

10
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,600
Aye, it's always England.

11
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,020
You'd think for all the hammering the TARDIS has got, you've gone an' spiked it

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,840
Hey, what are you doing?

13
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,940
Hey, what's all this stuff Doctor?

14
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,670
Foam, you silly. You often see the stuff along the sea shore.

15
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,880
But not big lumps like this, aye Doctor?

16
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,920
No, not usually. Jamie.

17
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,380
Hey Jamie, feel that.

18
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,280
Hey, look at that. Maybe that's where the foam's coming from.

19
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,020
Oh I hardly think so, Jamie. Let's go and see.

20
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,140
What is it?

21
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,200
Just what it says, Jamie. Euro Sea Gas.

22
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,650
Gas from the sea? Oh, who are you trying to kid?

23
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,170
And it has nothing to do with the foam then.

24
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,570
No. No, I shouldn't think so.

25
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,940
Would it not budge?

26
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,340
No, can't budge it, I'm afraid Jamie.

27
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,720
Ah well, have to use this.

28
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,840
-What's that? - A Sonic Screwdriver.

29
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,520
Never fails.

30
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,220
There we are. Neat isn't it?

31
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,520
All done by sound waves. Now what have we got here?

32
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,900
Oh yes.

33
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,230
What is it? What's that noise?

34
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,530
I don't know Jamie.

35
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,420
- I can hear it too.  - Yes.

36
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,360
Probably throbbing from a pump, you know.

37
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,280
Doctor please hurry up.

38
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,300
I don't like this place. It's so quiet.

39
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,340
I feel as if we're being watched.

40
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,740
Alright Victoria.

41
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,420
Now then, Jamie.

42
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,760
Doctor!

43
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,320
Doctor! 

44
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,740
Doctor?

45
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,740
Victoria?

46
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,080
Jamie you there?

47
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,500
I can't move... my legs.

48
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,840
What happened? What do you want?

49
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,560
Would someone kindly tell us where we are, please?

50
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,200
Why don't you answer?

51
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,580
Come on, where are we?

52
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,040
What have they done? Can't move...

53
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,380
I think we've... we've been tranquilised Victoria. Tranquilised.

54
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,880
Eh? Who do they think they are?

55
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,940
We should be the ones asking the questions.

56
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,760
I expect quite a lot of answers.

57
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,260
What is this place?

58
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,260
You mean you don't know?

59
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,780
If only I could just get up...

60
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,040
I wouldn't try if I were you.

61
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,560
You know, in this condition it's just a little difficult to communicate.

62
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,040
Shall we give them some U4 sir?

63
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,920
Yes. Do that Mr. Harris.

64
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,940
- Oh no.   - I think it's alright Victoria.

65
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,220
- Take it away from me, please.  - I think it's an antidote. 

66
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,160
There's nothing we can do about it you know...

67
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,540
Oh yes. That's better... Thank you.

68
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,080
Thank you very much, yes!

69
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,920
You were on the beach, by the pipe line, in a restricted area. Now why?

70
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,820
We were lost that's all.

71
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,440
You were tampering with the emergency release valve remote control.

72
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,660
You're a saboteur.

73
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,940
He's not. He's a doctor.

74
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,630
I can assure you. I was only being curious.

75
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,580
I don't really think how they could have anything...

76
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,440
When I want your opinion Harris, I'll ask for it.

77
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,360
In the mean time, lock them up in one of the cabins. 
I'll interrogate them later. 

78
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,860
And you lot get back to work.

79
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,500
Is he always as charming as that?

80
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,860
We're in something of an emergency at the moment.

81
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,100
You see, we've lost contact with one of our rigs at sea.

82
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,470
Communications have broken down?

83
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,285
No, that's what's so curious about it.

84
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,380
As far as we can tell our video link is functioning normally.

85
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,860
The crew just aren't answering.

86
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,760
You can't blame us for that surely.

87
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,980
There's also been a drop in pressure in the feed line from the rigs.

88
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,510
You were seen tampering with the release valve on the pipeline.

89
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,160
I told you I was merely being curious.

90
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Were you?

91
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,580
Are you calling us liars?

92
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,960
No. But you must admit your sudden appearance here 
inside our restricted area is suspicious.

93
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,720
That's no reason to shoot us down like animals.

94
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,615
Maybe not, but we were under security alert

95
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,600
and Mr Robson... well, is under considerable pressure himself.

96
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,980
I'm sorry, but I shall have to do what he says...

97
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,580
- and lock you up.  - Oh dear.

98
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,300
Would you... er... follow me?

99
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,820
- Come along, this way.   - Why do we always...

100
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,280
May I see your pass please madam?

101
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,380
Pass?

102
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,920
I have instructions that no one is to leave or enter the compound

103
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,500
without a written pass from Chief Robson.

104
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,460
Not until after the emergency.

105
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,280
But you know who I am.

106
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,700
My husband is second in command to Chief Robson.

107
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,060
- Yes Mrs Harris, I...  - Then let me pass.

108
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,240
Please.

109
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,400
Sorry madam. I think you should return to the residential block.

110
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,140
I'm sorry but there is nothing I can do to help you

111
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,360
until you tell me what you were doing with that release valve on the pipe line.

112
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,460
It wasn't the valve I was interested in.

113
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,560
Oh?

114
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,620
I heard a movement coming from inside the pipe.

115
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,960
A movement?

116
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,220
Oh it's alright, you can go.

117
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,760
Yes. Movement. Don't ask me what it was.

118
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,560
I'm not sure what you're trying to suggest,

119
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,560
but I can assure you, marine life couldn't possibly get inside the pipeline tube.

120
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,120
It would never get pass the drill pumps.

121
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,460
Aye, that's as maybe, but there was something inside that tube

122
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,000
- because I heard it too.  - And so did I.

123
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,160
Well if the pressure is down in the pipes, perhaps that's the reason why...

124
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,720
Perhaps marine life has got into the pipe.

125
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,780
But that's impossible.

126
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:52,960
We've spent years of time, money and research into perfecting our emergency system.

127
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,040
Well, perhaps there's a fracture in the pipes - a break,

128
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,360
- and something has got in that way?   - Oh I doubt it.

129
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:06,020
Mr Harris. I don't wish to appear interfering,

130
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,700
but don't you think it'd be a good idea to turn off the gas -

131
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,640
at least until you've had a chance to check.

132
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,200
- Chief Robson would never agree to that.   - Why not?

133
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,580
Well he doesn't believe in working to the book.

134
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,120
He prides himself that the flow has never been shut off ever since he took charge.

135
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,520
Well he sounds like a very silly man.

136
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,110
Hmmm. But he appears to be right about one thing.

137
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,580
You seem to know quite a lot about our business.

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,100
Ah, Chief. We've gained contact with Rig D.

139
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,365
Come in Rig D. Come in please.

140
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,820
Rig D. Can you hear me please?

141
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,460
Yes. Rig D to HQ. I can hear you.

142
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,860
CARNEY? What the dickens is going on out there?

143
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,120
- Everything is quite alright, Mr...  - What?

144
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,680
... have the situation under control.

145
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,000
Would you speak up man. I can't hear a word you're saying.

146
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,660
- Don't worry...  - are we losing volume?

147
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,360
No, sir. I don't understand.

148
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,580
Could you speak up a little louder Mr Carney?

149
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,660
Everything is ...

150
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,900
Carney? What happened to the emergency crew we sent you?

151
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,000
- Have they arrived yet?  - Yes!

152
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,280
Yes... But they must stay here for the time ...

153
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,420
They what?

154
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,500
They had a slight accident. Two men out of action.

155
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,600
Now listen Carney. You get that rig fixed A1 and quick.

156
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,760
But it will take some time.

157
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,300
What? What did you say? What's wrong with this thing.

158
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,290
I don't know, sir. It must be their end. He seems to be whispering.

159
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,340
Everything is under control.

160
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,800
Carney, speak up man.

161
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,720
Everything is under control.

162
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,930
Carney...

163
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,400
I think we've lost contact again sir.

164
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,570
Fix it man.

165
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,740
Price is getting too old for his job.

166
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,520
Mr. Robson, I think we should turn off the gas flow
coming from the rig. Make a check.

167
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,480
You think what Mr Harris?

168
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,620
That Doctor chap. The stranger. He said he heard a movement

169
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,700
coming from inside the pipe line on the beach.

170
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,820
Oh did he now. Did he say what he thought it was? Mice?

171
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,750
Chief?

172
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,300
She's down at propeller 3. Pressure's on just 157.

173
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,060
- 157? Are you sure?   - Yes. Sir.

174
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,820
- That means the gas flow pressure is down 3% every.. .- Twenty minutes.

175
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,380
Doesn't that prove that something must be blocking the pipe line?

176
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,540
It proves nothing of the sort.

177
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,420
It's probably a faulty gauge that's all. Check it.

178
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,200
Look, at least give it the benefit of the doubt.

179
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,740
When you want to find out about pipe lines and rigs Mr Harris,

180
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,340
the thing to do is to go out and see and work on them.

181
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,880
Look I'm merely saying that if something had got into the tube...

182
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,540
You let me worry about that.

183
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,100
But Mr Robson, please listen.

184
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,220
This ties up with what I've been trying to tell you.

185
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,740
For three weeks now, there's been a regular and increasing build up of falls in pressure...

186
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,440
Look I think you should at least look at my calculations.

187
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,980
The time ratio of the increases and falls 
corresponds to form a definite progressive pattern.

188
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,780
- So?  -  I'll get them.

189
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,220
What are you trying to prove Harris? That I don't know my job?

190
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,600
No, sir. Just that I do know mine.

191
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,660
It's your decision whether you take notice of my work

192
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,620
but I must put it on record that I have offered the information.

193
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,820
Don't threaten me boy. I've eaten up sods like you for breakfast.

194
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,660
You think you can baffle me with your little bits of paper don't you?

195
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,520
Alright, you go ahead and get them.

196
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,520
I'll show you where you've gone wrong.

197
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,230
Did you make a thorough check?

198
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,660
- Yes I checked it. Seems to be working properly.   - It's gone.

199
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,380
Doesn't seem to be anything wrong with her.

200
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,460
It's gone. The file's gone.

201
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,220
Well well well. Has it now?

202
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,690
I'm sure I put it in here this morning...

203
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,480
Err, I must have left the file on my desk at home.

204
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,980
- I'll go home and get...  - You won't. You'll stay here. 

205
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,500
I'm not doing your job as well as my own.

206
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,460
What's the matter sir? Are you scared that I might prove you wrong?

207
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,290
No. You go ahead. But you'd better have something more than a high blown theory,

208
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,030
because if you haven't, I'm going to take up and chop you up into little pieces

209
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,760
and throw you back to your crummy little university. Alright?

210
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,040
I've got it.

211
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,700
Put that down Victoria.

212
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,440
Can you see anyone?

213
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,610
All clear.

214
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,210
You think you can make it?

215
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,900
Of course I can make it. Hold on.

216
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,410
Don't bother, Jamie. You can do it with this.

217
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,200
Pick a lock with that hairpin? Don't be daft.

218
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,200
Clumsy.

219
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,530
Maggie. Where have you been? I've been trying to contact you.

220
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,080
I was on my way to the village, but Robson's clamped down on security.

221
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,620
I was just coming to find you for a pass.

222
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,860
Yes. There's been a bit of a flap on.

223
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,800
- Well can I have a pass?  - No. Not at the moment.

224
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,060
- Look. Could you do something for me?  - Yes what is it?

225
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,636
There's a file - it's probably in the middle draw of my desk in the study.

226
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,700
Could you get it and bring it to me at the control room?

227
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,320
Alright darling. But what's the panic?

228
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,940
I'll explain later. Go along.

229
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,240
Alright darling.

230
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,680
- Oh he's stuck.  - No he's not.

231
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,680
Are you ready Jamie. Right.

232
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,760
Told you not to bother.

233
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,620
Sorry, about that Jamie.

234
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,000
Ow... Seaweed?

235
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,640
Mr. Robson. Mr. Robson. 

236
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,320
Could I speak with you please?

237
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,420
Van Lutyens. I thought you were at the Control Rig.

238
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,980
I just got back on the supply boat.

239
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,360
Something wrong?

240
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,140
I'm not quite sure. The men out there seem very restless.

241
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,120
Restless? What are you talking about?

242
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,700
You lost contact with Rig D didn't you?

243
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,500
Yes it was only a temporary fault. We regained contact within the hour.

244
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,720
Then why didn't you tell us that?

245
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,760
Unusual incidents like that only cause tension on the rigs.

246
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,540
Don't tell me what happened out on the rigs.

247
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,000
I spent four years on one of those things without a break.

248
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,560
Then you should know better than anyone

249
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,880
how important it is to keep up the morale of the crew.

250
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,740
What do you want me to do? Wipe their noses for them?

251
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,420
Mind your own business van Lutyens.

252
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:42,980
Mr Robson. I think you're forgetting 
we also have an interest in Euro Sea Gas.

253
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,880
We?

254
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,140
I'm here for the Dutch Government, not for myself.

255
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,320
You're here to offer me your expert advice,
 not spread alarm amongst my crews.

256
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,000
How dare you say that to me?

257
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,060
I didn't ask you to come here - 
it was Megan Jones and those fools on the board.

258
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,560
I said it wouldn't work and it never has.

259
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,420
Only because you're too proud to accept advice.

260
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,480
Let's get one thing straight, my friend

261
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,320
When I need your advice I'll ask for it.

262
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,300
Control. Chief Baxter at Control Rig. Is Robson there?

263
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,320
Yes sir.

264
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,820
Mr. Robson sir. Chief Baxter from Control Rig sir.

265
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,620
Right.

266
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,520
Yes Baxter, what is it?

267
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,240
- Van Lutyens arrive there yet sir?   - Yes. Why?

268
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,760
Did he tell you how the men feel sir?

269
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,140
Now listen Baxter. I'm in charge of this outfit - not van Lutyens.

270
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,160
- You take orders from me not him.  - Yes sir.

271
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,900
- But there's something else.   - What else?

272
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,660
Something seems to have got inside the pipe lines.

273
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,840
- Inside the pipe lines?   - We've all heard it sir.

274
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,660
- Heard what?  - This sound. 

275
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,520
At first I thought it was something to do with the pumps, but it isn't.

276
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,291
Most peculiar sound.

277
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,820
A sort of regular thumping, pulsating... like a heartbeat.

278
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,220
That's the noise I heard on the beach.

279
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,160
What is it Doctor?

280
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,540
I don't know, but we're going to find out. Come on, Jamie.

281
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,420
Oh... ah Victoria. No. Not you.

282
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,760
- Why not?  - I think it'd be better if you... 

283
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,420
Err... stayed back in the bunk room... hmmm?... please.

284
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,620
Alright.

285
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,700
Control.

286
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,840
Mrs Harris here. Married Block 420.

287
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,290
Could I speak to my husband please?

288
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,420
Have you recalibrated it?

289
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,960
I've just done Phase two.

290
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,110
Start on Phase three.

291
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,130
Mr Robson.

292
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,950
Yes Harris. Where are your figures?

293
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,920
Oh I haven't got them, sir.

294
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,200
I sent my wife for them, but she's not well.

295
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,080
- I wondered if I could go and...  - I would not. 

296
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,580
Tell her to call a doctor, not pester you.

297
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,680
But Dr. Patterson is still out at Rig D sir.

298
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,600
Tell her to get one in from the outside.

299
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,640
But you've still go the compound on full emergency alert. Remember?

300
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,700
Alright. But make it quick.

301
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,570
What's that thing supposed to do?

302
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,520
It's an impeller Jamie.

303
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:32,000
It pumps gas from the main pipeline out to sea. Come on.

304
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,880
- This is the pipeline, then.  - Yes. Yes. They all are.

305
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,380
It's a continuation of the pipe we found on the beach.

306
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,410
Aye? But we can see inside the pipe.

307
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,580
Yes. It's transparent for checking condensation and...

308
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,920
er... anything else that might get inside.

309
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,620
Hello? Is anybody there?

310
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,180
Oh come on...

311
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,210
There it is again Jamie. Can you hear it?

312
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,840
Aye. What is it?

313
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,700
Your guess is as good as mine. There's something inside.

314
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,640
DOCTOR!

315
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,500
Victoria! Come on.

316
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,020
- Jamie!  - Victoria!

317
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,500
