1
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:13,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,898
There Victoria, up you get.

3
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:30,547
Trust you to bring us right down in the middle of the sea.

4
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:33,778
The TARDIS is perfectly capable of floating you know.

5
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:35,892
Where are we exactly?

6
00:01:36,187 --> 00:01:37,557
Oh England undoubtedly.

7
00:01:37,737 --> 00:01:39,041
Aye, you can tell by the weather.

8
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,493
And by the cliffs.

9
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:42,797
We always seem to land on this planet.

10
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:47,728
Aye, it's always England. You'd think for all the hammering the TARDIS has got, you've gone an' spiked it

11
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:57,647
Hey, what are you doing? Hey, what's all this stuff Doctor?

12
00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:00,378
Foam, you silly. You often see the stuff along the sea shore.

13
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,584
But not big lumps like this, aye Doctor?

14
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:06,807
No, not usually. Jamie. Hey Jamie, feel that.

15
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:34,172
Hey, look at that. Maybe that's where the foam's coming from.

16
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:36,736
Oh I hardly think so, Jamie. Let's go and see.

17
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:56,052
What is it?

18
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,004
Just what it says, Jamie. Euro Sea Gas.

19
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:03,457
Gas from the sea? Oh, who are you trying to kid?

20
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,974
And it has nothing to do with the foam then.

21
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,572
No. No, I shouldn't think so.

22
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:20,491
Would it not budge?

23
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,209
No, can't budge it, I'm afraid Jamie. Ah well, have to use this.

24
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:32,411
It's a Sonic Screwdriver. Never fails.

25
00:03:40,664 --> 00:03:47,702
There we are. Neat isn't it? All done by sound waves. Now what have we got here?

26
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:50,491
Oh yes.

27
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:56,932
What is it? What's that noise?

28
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,935
I don't know Jamie.

29
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,116
I can hear it too.

30
00:04:21,426 --> 00:04:24,926
Yes. Probably throbbing from a pump, you know.

31
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:31,830
Doctor please hurry up. I don't like this place. It's so quiet. I feel as if we're being watched.

32
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:33,305
Alright Victoria.

33
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:37,256
Jamie!

34
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:43,016
Doctor! DOCTOR!

35
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:51,626
Victoria... Jamie you there?

36
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:58,175
I can't move... my legs.

37
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:02,746
What happened? What do you want?

38
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:12,979
Would someone kindly tell us where we are?... Why don't you answer?

39
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:15,342
Come on where are we?

40
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:19,941
What have they done? Can't move...

41
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:25,288
I think we've... we've been tranquilised Victoria. Tranquilised.

42
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:26,961
Eh? Who do they think they are?

43
00:06:27,157 --> 00:06:31,450
We should be the ones asking the questions. I expect quite a lot of answers.

44
00:06:31,637 --> 00:06:32,549
What is this place?

45
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:33,660
You mean you don't know?

46
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:34,975
If only I could just get up...

47
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:36,327
I wouldn't try if I were you.

48
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:40,492
You know, in this condition it's just a little difficult to communicate.

49
00:06:40,673 --> 00:06:42,104
Shall we give them some U4 sir?

50
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:42,788
Eh?

51
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:44,224
Yes. Do that Mr. Harris.

52
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:45,117
Oh no.

53
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:46,468
I think it's alright Victoria.

54
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:47,244
No...

55
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:49,238
I think it's an antidote. There's nothing we can do about it you know...

56
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:59,233
Oh yes. That's better... Thank you. Thank you very much.

57
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,628
You were on the beach, by the pipe line, in a restricted area. Now why?

58
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:06,694
We were lost that's all.

59
00:07:06,924 --> 00:07:10,297
You were tampering with the emergency release valve remote control. You're a saboteur.

60
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,588
He's not. He's a doctor.

61
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:15,537
I can assure you. I was only being curious.

62
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:17,703
I don't really think how they could have anything...

63
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:24,424
When I want your opinion Harris, I'll ask for it. In the mean time, lock them up in one of the cabins. I'll interrogate them later. And you lot get back to work.

64
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:28,162
Is he always as charming as that?

65
00:07:28,343 --> 00:07:33,340
We're in something of an emergency at the moment. You see, we've lost contact with one of our rigs at sea.

66
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:36,370
Communications have broken down?

67
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:42,209
No that's what's so curious about it. As far as we can tell our video link is functioning normally. The crew just aren't answering.

68
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:44,149
You can't blame us for that surely.

69
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:51,410
There's also been a drop in pressure in the feed line from the rigs. You were seen tampering with the release valve on the pipeline.

70
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:53,679
I told you I was merely being curious.

71
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:55,186
Were you?

72
00:07:55,396 --> 00:07:56,159
Are you calling us liars?

73
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,241
No. But you must admit your sudden appearance here inside our restricted area is suspicious.

74
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:03,964
That's no reason to shoot us down like animals.

75
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:14,922
Maybe not, but we were under security alert and Mr Robson... well, is under considerable pressure himself. I'm sorry, but I shall have to do what he says and lock you up.

76
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:15,803
Oh dear.

77
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,125
Would you... er... follow me?

78
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:18,375
Why do we always...

79
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:38,923
May I see your pass please madam?

80
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:39,976
Pass?

81
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:45,976
I have instructions that no one is to leave or enter the compound without a written pass from Chief Robson. Not until after the emergency.

82
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:51,178
But you know who I am. My husband is second in command to Chief Robson.

83
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:52,318
Yes Mrs Harris, I...

84
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:56,113
Then let me pass... please.

85
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:59,892
Sorry madam. I think you should return to the residential block.

86
00:09:08,184 --> 00:09:13,716
I'm sorry but there is nothing I can do to help you until you tell me what you were doing with that release valve on the pipe line.

87
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:17,062
It wasn't the valve I was interested in.

88
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:17,932
Oh?

89
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:20,907
I heard a movement coming from inside the pipe.

90
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:22,345
Movement?

91
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:23,436
Yes.

92
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:24,650
Oh it's alright, you can go.

93
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:27,234
Yes. Movement. Don't ask me what it was.

94
00:09:27,538 --> 00:09:35,421
I'm not sure what you're trying to suggest, but I can assure you, marine life couldn't possibly get inside the pipeline tube. It would never get pass the drill pumps.

95
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:39,521
Aye, that's it. Maybe there was something inside that tube because I heard it too.

96
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,694
And so did I.

97
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:46,490
Well if the pressure is down in the pipes, perhaps that's the reason why... marine life has got into the pipe.

98
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:51,947
But that's impossible. We've spent years of time, money and research into perfecting our emergency system.

99
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:56,685
Well, perhaps there's a fracture in the pipes - a break, and something has got in that way?

100
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:57,765
Oh I doubt it.

101
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:09,118
Mr Harris. I don't wish to appear interfering, but don't you think it'd be a good idea to turn off the gas - at least until you've had a chance to check.

102
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:11,160
Chief Robson would never agree to that.

103
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:12,054
Why not?

104
00:10:12,274 --> 00:10:18,289
Well he doesn't believe in working to the book. He prides himself that the flow has never been shut off ever since he took charge.

105
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:19,861
Well he sounds like a very silly man.

106
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:24,802
Hmmm. But he appears to be right about one thing. You seem to know quite a lot about our business.

107
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:40,953
Ah, Chief. We've gained contact with Rig D. Come in Rig D. Come in please. Rig D. Can you hear me please?

108
00:10:41,252 --> 00:10:44,662
Yes. Rig D to HQ. I can hear you.

109
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,920
CARNEY? What the dickens is going on out there?

110
00:10:47,158 --> 00:10:49,487
Everything is quite alright, Mr Robson.

111
00:10:49,742 --> 00:10:50,268
What?

112
00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:52,710
We have the situation under control.

113
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:54,938
Would you speak up man. I can't hear a word you're saying.

114
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:55,890
Don't worry...

115
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:57,167
Price, are we losing volume?

116
00:10:57,327 --> 00:11:00,202
No, sir. I don't understand. Could you speak up a little louder Mr Carney?

117
00:11:00,522 --> 00:11:02,527
Everything is under control.

118
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:08,000
Carney? What happened to the emergency crew we sent you? Have they arrived yet?

119
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:12,144
Yes... Yes... But they must stay here for the time being.

120
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:13,151
What?

121
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:17,293
They had a slight accident. Two men out of action.

122
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:20,183
Now listen Carney. You get that rig fixed A1 and quick.

123
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:22,022
But it will take some time.

124
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,495
What? What did you say? What's wrong with this thing.

125
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,691
I don't know, sir. It must be their end. He seems to be whispering.

126
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,745
Everything is under control.

127
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:33,005
Carney, speak up man.

128
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:35,129
Everything is under control.

129
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:36,336
Carney...

130
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:41,025
I think we've lost contact again sir.

131
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:41,977
Fix it man.

132
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:47,149
Price is getting too old for his job.

133
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:50,819
Mr. Robson, I think we should turn off the gas flow coming from the rig. Make a check.

134
00:11:51,818 --> 00:11:52,888
You think what Mr Harris?

135
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:57,860
That Doctor chap. The stranger. He said he heard a movement coming from inside the pipe line on the beach.

136
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,048
Oh did he now. Did he say what he thought it was? Mice?

137
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,157
Chief?

138
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:06,707
She's down at propeller 3. Pressure's on just 157.

139
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:08,462
Are you sure?

140
00:12:08,824 --> 00:12:09,759
Yes. Sure.

141
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:14,333
That means the gas flow pressure is down 3% every...

142
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,411
Twenty minutes.

143
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:17,789
Doesn't that prove that something must be blocking the pipe line?

144
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:20,950
It proves nothing of the sort. It's probably a faulty gauge that's all. Check it.

145
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:22,603
Look, at least give it the benefit of the doubt.

146
00:12:22,802 --> 00:12:26,699
When you want to find out about pipe lines and rigs Mr Harris, the thing to do is to go out and see and work on them.

147
00:12:26,892 --> 00:12:28,829
Look I'm merely saying that if something had got into the tube...

148
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:30,078
You let me worry about that.

149
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:51,227
But Mr Robson, please listen. This ties up with what I've been trying to tell you. For three weeks now, there's been a regular and increasing build up of falls in pressure... Look I think you should at least look at my calculations. The time ratio of the increases and falls corresponds to form a definite progressive pattern. I'll get them.

150
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:54,583
What are you trying to prove Harris? That I don't know my job?

151
00:12:54,874 --> 00:13:02,502
No. Just that I know mine. It's your decision whether you take notice of my work but I must put it on record that I have offered the information.

152
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:14,381
Don't threaten me boy. I've eaten up sods like you for breakfast. You think you can baffle me with your little bits of paper don't you? Alright, you go ahead and get them. I'll show you where you've gone wrong.

153
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:18,639
Did you make a thorough check?

154
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:20,374
Yes I checked it. Seems to be working properly.

155
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,498
It's gone.

156
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:24,668
Doesn't seem to be anything wrong with her.

157
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:26,600
It's gone. The file's gone.

158
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:28,397
Well well well. Has it now?

159
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:35,215
I'm sure I put it in here this morning... er I must have left the file on my desk at home. I'll go home and get...

160
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:37,562
You won't. You'll stay here. I'm not doing your job as well as my own.

161
00:13:37,772 --> 00:13:40,686
What's the matter sir? Are you scared that I might prove you wrong?

162
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:52,333
No. You go ahead. But you'd better have something more than a high blown theory, because if you haven't, I'm going to take up and chop you up into little pieces and throw you back to your crummy little university. Alright?

163
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:57,897
I've got it.

164
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:03,049
Put that down Victoria. Can you see anyone?

165
00:14:03,294 --> 00:14:04,212
All clear.

166
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:05,815
You think you can make it?

167
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:07,350
Of course I can make it. Hold on.

168
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:12,010
Don't bother, Jamie. You can do it with this.

169
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:14,583
Pick a lock with that hairpin? Don't be daft.

170
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:19,807
Clumsy.

171
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:27,130
Maggie. Where have you been? I've been trying to contact you.

172
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:31,879
I was on my way to the village, but Robson's clamped down on security. I was just coming to find you for a pass.

173
00:14:32,077 --> 00:14:33,242
Yes. There's been a bit of a flap on.

174
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:34,398
Well can I have a pass?

175
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:36,571
No. Not at the moment. Look. Could you do something for me?

176
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,574
Yes what is it?

177
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:43,800
There's a file - it's probably in the middle draw of my desk in the study. Could you get it and bring it to me at the control room?

178
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:45,463
Alright darling. But what's the panic?

179
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:46,740
I'll explain later. Go along.

180
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:48,296
Alright darling.

181
00:14:58,076 --> 00:14:59,904
Oh he's stuck.

182
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:04,633
No he's not. Are you ready Jamie. Right.

183
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:16,946
Told you not to bother.

184
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:20,701
Sorry, about that Jamie.

185
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:16,691
Ow... Seaweed?

186
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:49,917
Mr. Robson. Could I speak with you please?

187
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:52,902
Van Lutyens. I thought you were at the Control Rig.

188
00:16:53,131 --> 00:16:54,700
I just got back on the supply boat.

189
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:55,868
Something wrong?

190
00:16:56,168 --> 00:16:59,879
I'm not quite sure. The men out there seem very restless.

191
00:17:00,172 --> 00:17:02,124
Restless? What are you talking about?

192
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:04,439
You lost contact with Rig D didn't you?

193
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:06,830
Yes it was only a temporary fault. We regained contact within the hour.

194
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:15,067
Then why didn't you tell us that? Unusual incidents like that only cause tension on the rigs.

195
00:17:15,262 --> 00:17:19,147
Don't tell me what happened out on the rigs. I spent four years on one of those things without a break.

196
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:23,080
Then you should know better than anyone how important it is to keep up the morale of the crew.

197
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:26,961
What do you want me to do? Wipe their noses for them? Mind your own business van Lutyens.

198
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:36,133
Mr Robson. I think you're forgetting we also have an interest in Euro Sea Gas.

199
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:37,039
We?

200
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,467
I'm here for the Dutch Government, not for myself.

201
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:43,321
You're here to offer me your expert advice, not spread alarm amongst my crews.

202
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,175
How dare you say that to me?

203
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,214
I didn't ask you to come here - it was Megan Jones and those fools on the board. I said it wouldn't work and it never has.

204
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,242
Only because you're too proud to accept advice.

205
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:57,020
Let's get one thing straight, my friend - when I need your advice I'll ask for it.

206
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:23,898
Control. Chief Baxter at Control Rig. Is Robson there?

207
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:28,230
Yes sir. Mr. Robson sir. Chief Baxter from Control Rig sir.

208
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:34,785
Right. Yes Baxter, what is it?

209
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,185
Van Lutyens arrive there yet sir?

210
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:37,532
Yes. Why?

211
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,070
Did he tell you how the men feel sir?

212
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:43,714
Now listen Baxter. I'm in charge of this outfit - not van Lutyens. You take orders from me not him.

213
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:45,483
Yes sir. But there's something else.

214
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:46,439
What else?

215
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:48,019
Something seems to have got inside the pipe lines.

216
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:49,557
Inside the pipe lines?

217
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:50,821
We've all heard it sir.

218
00:18:50,992 --> 00:18:51,965
Heard what?

219
00:18:52,131 --> 00:19:01,096
This sound. At first I thought it was something to do with the pumps, but it isn't. Most peculiar sound. A sort of regular thumping, pulsating... like a heartbeat.

220
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,150
That's the noise I heard on the beach.

221
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,164
What is it Doctor?

222
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:10,529
I don't know, but we're going to find out. Come on, Jamie. Oh... ah Victoria. No. Not you.

223
00:19:10,743 --> 00:19:11,686
Why not?

224
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,422
I think it'd be better if you... er... stayed back in the bunk room... hmmm?... please.

225
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:17,495
Alright.

226
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:45,392
Control.

227
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:50,597
Mrs Harris here. Married Block 420. Could I speak to my husband please?

228
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:54,729
Have you recalibrated it?

229
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:56,265
I've just done Phase two.

230
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:57,418
Start on Phase three.

231
00:19:57,639 --> 00:19:58,431
Mr Robson.

232
00:19:58,691 --> 00:20:00,252
Yes Harris. Where are your figures?

233
00:20:00,494 --> 00:20:07,890
Oh I haven't got them, sir. I sent my wife for them, but she's not well. I wondered if I could go and...

234
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,725
I would not. Tell her to call a doctor, not pester you.

235
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,805
But Dr. Patterson is still out at Rig D sir.

236
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:13,909
Tell her to get one in from the outside.

237
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,948
But you've still go the compound on full emergency alert. Remember?

238
00:20:18,544 --> 00:20:22,004
Alright. But make it quick.

239
00:22:14,396 --> 00:22:15,875
What's that thing supposed to do?

240
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:23,037
It's an impeller Jamie. It pumps gas from the main pipeline out to sea. Come on Jamie.

241
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:35,443
This is the pipeline, then.

242
00:22:35,636 --> 00:22:39,775
Yes. Yes. They all are. It's a continuation of the pipe we found on the beach.

243
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:42,011
Aye? But we can see inside the pipe.

244
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:48,401
Yes. It's transparent for checking condensation and... er... anything else that might get inside.

245
00:22:55,065 --> 00:23:00,581
Hello? Is anybody there? Oh come on...

246
00:23:19,927 --> 00:23:22,116
There it is again Jamie. Can you hear it?

247
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,743
Aye. What is it?

248
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:27,606
Your guess is as good as mine. There's something inside.

249
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:29,762
DOCTOR!

250
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:32,250
Victoria! Come on.

251
00:23:33,882 --> 00:23:42,081
Jamie... Jamie... help!

252
00:23:42,724 --> 00:23:43,916
Victoria. Where are you?

253
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:46,523
Doctor... Jamie...

254
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,929
Victoria. We're coming.

255
00:24:00,414 --> 00:24:02,500
Doctor... Jamie... hurry.
