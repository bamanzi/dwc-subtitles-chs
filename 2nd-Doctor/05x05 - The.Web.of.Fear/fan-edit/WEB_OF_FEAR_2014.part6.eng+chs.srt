What are we going to do now, Staff?
我们现在打算做什么，Staff？

2
00:57:17,315 --> 00:57:20,752
The main door should keep the fungus out of the tunnels for a bit.
这道门应该能把真菌网挡住一阵

3
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,452
We must warn the others that HQ's had it.
我们必须警告其他人总部已经沦陷了

4
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:24,171
Right.
是

Well, come on, then.
那就快来

00:57:25,422 --> 00:57:26,528
Oh, oh no, not me.

You're not disobeying an order, are you, Evans?
你不服从命令是吗，Evans？

8
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,475
Now look here, Staff. If we go up there, and this stuff breaks out, we'll be trapped!
现在你看，Staff。如果我们上去，而这个东西扩散了，我们就被困住了

9
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:36,196
Now look, lad, you're scared, that's understandable.
听着小子，你害怕，这是可以理解德

10
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:39,110
But you've been in the Army long enough to know that orders is orders.
但你在军队待得够久了，该知道命令就是命令

11
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:42,910
There's four people up there. If we don't warn them, they're for the chop.
上面有四个人，如果我们不警告他们，他们就任凭宰割了

12
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:47,405
So? Four of them's getting the chop - there's no reason to make it six, is there?
所以啊，他们四个被宰割，没理由要变成六个啊，对不？

13
00:57:47,616 --> 00:57:50,750
I've had enough of your lip for one day. Now come on! Follow me.
今天一天我算是受够你那张破嘴了。现在快点，跟着我

14
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,371
Evans! Come back here!

15
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,780
Not on your nelly! Cheerio, Staff!
不跟你一起了！祝你好运，Staff！

16
00:57:59,965 --> 00:58:02,698
Right, lad - I'll get you for this!
好，小子，我会找你算账的！

17
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:09,662
Anne...

18
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:11,732
Hey!
嘿！

00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:17,586
Stop! Come back here! ... Stop!
停下！回来这里！... 停下！

20
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:24,223
Anne, I've been thinking. Until we know who else is working for the Intelligence...
Anne，我一直在想。在我们确切知道还有谁在为大智慧工作以前...

21
00:58:24,316 --> 00:58:26,541
- Everyone must be suspect.  - Yes?
- 每个人都是有嫌疑的   - 嗯?

22
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,596
Well, the fewer people who know this chap's on our side, the better.
知道这个家伙在我们这边的人，越少越好

23
00:58:28,878 --> 00:58:33,441
Yes... yes, and whoever is the Intelligence is bound to know that you're controlling this Yeti.
是的，不管谁是大智慧，他肯定知道是你在控制这个雪怪

Mmm... I know.

You are to remain here for... Do you think a minute will be enough?

What for?

00:58:45,145 --> 00:58:46,051
For us to get clear.
够我们俩闪人

28

Perhaps.
也许吧

29
00:58:47,373 --> 00:58:52,880
You are to remain here for ninety seconds, and then resume acting on orders from the Intelligence

30
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,200
until you are told otherwise. Is that understood?
直到你得到其它指示，明白了吗

31
00:59:00,086 --> 00:59:04,923
Right. Switch off, for ninety seconds, starting from... now.

It is them! Come on!

Oh. What are you doing down here, anyway?

I'll tell you another time. Hello, Colonel.

Arnold! But Evans said - the fungus...

Well we haven't got any time to find out.

No!

I'm afraid so, sir. The main doors should keep it out of the tunnels for a bit, but...

73
01:01:05,602 --> 01:01:06,415

Scarpered, sir.

你...你好！如果你们...你们在找你们的朋友，他去那边了...

Look, you don't want me!... I'm not one of them, see?...
我说，你不会想要我的！... 我不是他们中的一员，明白？

Driver, that's what I am... shouldn't be down here at all, really...

On the loose, sir, I might be able to do something.

 If only you could distract them, sir.

85
01:02:47,725 --> 01:02:48,580

I think it wants us to go on, sir.

Where are we being taken, Professor?

A pyramid!
一座金字塔！

93
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:39,377

是的，但有些不一样，我们...之前从没见过这个样子的。很有意思！

94
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,877
This must be the machine that the Intelligence intends using on the Doctor.
这肯定就是大智慧说要用在博士身上的那个机器

95
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:46,543
Oh, no no. No, I shouldn't if I was you.

Yes, I think perhaps you're right.

You don't think the Colonel...

Well unfortunately I've lost track of him.

Oh, that's a great help!

Well, never mind, I... I want you to take this microphone
这个，别管了...我要你拿着这个麦克风...

... and keep on calling our Yeti to you.

How will I know I've got the right one?
我怎么知道过来的是对的？

109
01:04:21,183 --> 01:04:24,422
Well, you'll soon know if you haven't got the right one, won't you!
哦，如果不对的话，你很快就会知道，是吧？

110
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:27,822
Jamie, I hope you don't suffer from claustrophobia!

Sergeant! Oh, oh thank heavens I found you!

我一个人在这下面转悠了...好几个世纪了！

喔喔喔，我们都快忘记你了，Chorley 先生

114
01:04:48,703 --> 01:04:53,406
Tried to get out over the surface, but... there were Yeti everywhere!
试过逃到地面上去，但是...到处都有雪怪！

115
01:04:53,500 --> 01:05:02,406
And there's this... this fungus, and fog, all around, you see, and... it's hopeless!
而这里有这个...真菌网，雾瘴，到处都是，你看，还有... 让人绝望

116
01:05:07,252 --> 01:05:08,931
Where's the control box?
控制盒在哪儿？

117
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:10,966
Hm?

The control box!

119
01:05:13,544 --> 01:05:14,580
It's in my pocket.
在我口袋里

120
01:05:14,989 --> 01:05:19,477
Well, why don't you use it on these Yeti? And then maybe we can escape!
怎么，你怎么不对这些雪怪使用？那样的话也许我们能逃出去

Oh, no. I must meet the Intelligence face to face.

01:05:24,459 --> 01:05:25,280
What is it?
什么事？

124
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:29,598
Been thinking - the Yeti haven't noticed McCrimmon's disappearance yet.
我在想，雪怪还没有留意到 McCrimmon 已经不见了

125
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,098
Not that I think he'll be able to achieve anything.
倒不是说我觉得他能搞定什么

126
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:32,161
Go on...

Well, I don't really know how to say this, but, um... 
这个...我真不知道该怎么说，但是...

129
01:05:38,147 --> 01:05:40,675
You mean, am I going to give myself up?

130
01:05:41,279 --> 01:05:44,976
Yes. Of course, the decision must be yours, and yours alone.
是的。当然，决定是你自己做，独自做

131
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,176
But the Intelligence did promise to release Travers and Victoria.

132
01:05:48,716 --> 01:05:50,092
You believe that?

Evans, where the devil have you been?

137
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,330
Didn't Staff Arnold tell you, sir?
Staff Arnold 没有告诉你吗，长官？

138
01:06:04,706 --> 01:06:07,375
Yes. Sounded very like desertion to me.
是。听起来很像是当逃兵了

139
01:06:07,647 --> 01:06:11,174
Desertion? Me? Oh, good heavens, no!
逃兵？我？噢，老天，不会！

140

No, I... I thought I'd try a single-handed and desperate attempt to rescue Professor Travers and the girl!
不，我还想我要单枪匹马，死命去救 Travers 教授和那个女孩儿呢

141
01:06:18,543 --> 01:06:20,442
Isn't Staff Arnold about?
Staff Arnold 在这附近吗？

142
01:06:20,778 --> 01:06:21,543
No.
不在

143

不不！... 不！别管我！你们没明白，我必须待在这里！

Well, that's that then, innit?
啊，那就是那个东西，是吧？

如果我们没把你从那里面拉出来，你现在已经是一堆黄土了

你就好了？我告诉过你别管我！现在你破坏了一切！

What do you mean, Doctor?
你什么意思，博士

噢，为什么他们就不能别管我呢？我已经反转了那个头盔里面的项圈

The Intelligence wouldn't have drained me, I had... would have drained the Intelligence!

Oh, poor fellow!

Do you mean to say that Arnold wasn't the Intelligence?
你的意思是说 Arnold 不是大智慧？

You don't really think so. Do you?

Yes, yes I do.
我是这么想
