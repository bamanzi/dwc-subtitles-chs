1
00:13:49,476 --> 00:13:53,298
A doctor! Well, if he was anywhere near those explosives when they went up...

2
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:58,384
Yes sir. Don't you think I should go and have a look, sir? The youngsters said he was following the cable.

3
00:13:58,623 --> 00:13:59,672
Yes, you'd better.

4
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:00,443
Sir!

5
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,994
Oh, and Staff, take someone with you.

6
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,143
Sir!

7
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:17,659
Father?

8
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:18,453
Hmm...?

9
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,223
The soldiers have found two youngsters in the tunnels. They seem to know a great deal about the Yeti.

10
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:22,938
Oh?

11
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:24,445
They know they're robots!

12
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:25,104
What!

13
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:27,484
And they know about the control spheres, too.

14
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:30,369
But they can't have - I mean, the public were never told!

15
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:31,336
I know.

16
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:44,979
Hello, hello, Holborn?... This is HQ to Holborn. Can you hear me?... Not a sausage.

17
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:46,305
There must be someone manning the phone.

18
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,638
OK, Lane, what gives?

19
00:14:49,043 --> 00:14:50,807
Well, it's just firing at the other end, sir.

20
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:51,673
Firing?

21
00:14:51,888 --> 00:14:52,808
Yes, sir. Listen.

22
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,286
Oh, good grief, no!

23
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,433
Hello, HQ to Holborn?

24
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:17,881
What happened, Lane?

25
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,514
Well, it was difficult to hear, sir. I think the truck was late getting there...

26
00:15:20,718 --> 00:15:21,428
Then what?

27
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:24,437
Well they must have got the ammo unloaded, sir, 'cos he says they were jumped when they were moving.

28
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:26,281
Take O'Brien and a couple of the others.

29
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:27,730
Sir! Come on, mate.

30
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:31,728
Here, you're not going out there?

31
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:36,384
Yes, Mr Chorley. Want to come? Report some action first hand?

32
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,244
Well, I don't think I'd better get in the way. I... er... think I'd better stay here, don't you?

33
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:42,504
Yes. Yes, I think you better had.

34
00:15:47,355 --> 00:15:48,577
Father?

35
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,893
But it... it can't be...

36
00:15:53,248 --> 00:16:00,101
Why that's... that's over... forty years ago!

37
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:01,500
What's going on here?

38
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:05,324
Oh Jamie, don't you recognise him? It's Professor Travers.

39
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:10,576
So it is! Professor Travers! Here, hasn't he got old!

40
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:11,310
Huh?

41
00:16:11,494 --> 00:16:14,435
Oh, but we're very pleased to see you, Professor, very pleased.

42
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:19,838
The time machine... it was all true then?

43
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:24,454
The TARDIS - I mean aye, of course it's true! Hey, do you know what's happened to the Doctor?

44
00:16:24,624 --> 00:16:25,274
Oh, is he safe?

45
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:26,146
Isn't he with you?

46
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:29,396
No, he's in the tunnels. Arnold's gone to look for him. Father, what is going on?

47
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:32,982
Oh dear, I do hope he's alright. Come on, Jamie, let's go and find out if he's got back yet.

48
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:36,128
Father!

49
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:40,687
Eh? Oh, Victoria, try and explain to Anne, will you?

50
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:42,115
Oh dear!

51
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:01,524
There hasn't been an explosion, Staff!

52
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,921
Oh, no - well at least, we hope not.

53
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:03,673
I can see that, lad... Here!

54
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:16,876
No sign of that Doctor bloke.

55
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:20,352
No... here, give me a hand with this.

56
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:31,859
It's our detonator, alright. It's fired, too... 'ere, hang on a minute. All the ammo, Staff. If it's fired, then why didn't...

57
00:17:32,074 --> 00:17:35,578
Yeah, why didn't this tunnel go up?... No damage at all...

58
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:37,866
Yet something blew up here!

59
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:42,267
It's obvious, ain't it? It's been got at.

60
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,451
Where's that Doctor? That's what I'd like to know.

61
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,344
Tibet? Tibet? You're joking.

62
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:54,019
That's where old Travers says they come from. He reckons they're Abominable Snowmen.

63
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:57,442
Well, he's off his chump, ain't he? How'd they get here in the first place?

64
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:58,825
Come through the post, don't they?

65
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,540
Nah, seriously. Outer space, that's where they come from. Well that's what I reckon, anyway.

66
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:06,712
Oh do leave off! You've been reading too many kids' comics, you have!

67
00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:08,982
Alright then, Corp, where do they come from?

68
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:13,608
It's a foreign power, ain't it? Bacteriological warfare, that's what that stuff is in the tunnels.

69
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:14,975
What, that fungus stuff?

70
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:19,248
Yeah. And them Yeti are some sort of new weapon. Well, a sort of robot army.

71
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:20,893
What, you mean it ain't real then?

72
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:32,769
Father?

73
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:33,904
Hmm?

74
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:36,633
Have you ever seen this TARDIS?

75
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:39,493
No, no, I can't say I have.

76
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:42,034
It all sounds a bit far-fetched to me.

77
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:45,074
You know, I think the Doctor's at the back of all this.

78
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,270
What do you mean?

79
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:50,815
Doesn't it strike you as odd that on the two occasions you've encountered the Yeti, you've also come across the Doctor?

80
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:51,981
Well?

81
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,278
Well, it's obvious - he controls them!

82
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,812
Oh, but surely...

83
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:59,188
What? Oh, tea. Thank you, my dear.

84
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:01,966
Oh, aren't you having any?

85
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,792
No, I think I'll go and lie down for a bit.

86
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:06,215
Good idea.

87
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,297
Do you think she heard?

88
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:22,828
No... in any case, what you say is nonsense, Anne.
I saw the Doctor defeat those robots and save Detsen Monastery.
He wouldn't do that if he was in league with them, now would he?

89
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,213
No, no I suppose not. 

90
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:29,079
Here, Corp, look at this!

91
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:37,049
What... oh crikey! That's what comes of talking about it!

92
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:39,187
It's that fungus stuff, it's moving again!

93
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:45,660
Don't worry!

94
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:53,470
Can't help it - I feel... responsible somehow.
 If only the Doctor would turn up. I'm sure he could help us.

95
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,663
'Scuse me, sir...

96
00:19:55,858 --> 00:19:56,613
Eh, what?

97
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:59,801
That fungus stuff, it's on the move again. Euston Square's gone.

98
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:01,631
Come on, let's have a look!

99
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,093
It's on the move again, Weams?

100
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:09,905
Yes, sir. Kings Cross has gone, and it's moving on to Farringdon.

101
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:11,946
It's never moved as fast as this before!

102
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:13,612
Hasn't moved at all the last three weeks, Miss.

103
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:15,043
What started it up again all of a sudden?

104
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:16,109
Can't say.

105
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:20,647
Strange, isn't it, that all this should happen on the very day that your mysterious Doctor friend turns up?

106
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:22,038
He hasn't turned up.

107
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:25,745
Precisely. He could have sent those kids in here as spies.

108
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,820
Rubbish! Would Jamie go away and leave Victoria, if he didn't intend coming back again?

109
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,584
Excuse me, sir, but where is the young lady?

110
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:33,173
Oh, in the Common Room, I suppose.

111
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:35,509
No she's not, 'cos I went in there when I was looking for you!

112
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:38,699
What? Well... where is she then?

113
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:57,471
Jamie? Doctor?... Jamie? Doctor?

114
00:20:57,892 --> 00:20:58,630
Victoria!

115
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,465
Oh, Doctor, thank goodness I found you! Are you alright?

116
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:03,324
Look, sir, the fungus! It's moving again!

117
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:09,930
Hope the Captain and Staff Arnold ain't anywhere near that little lot.

118
00:21:10,506 --> 00:21:15,390
Lane? Lane! Fall back, you'll never hold them!

119
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,571
Will nothing stop them?

120
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:39,507
Come on, back!

121
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:19,931
We couldn't hold 'em, sir. They're coming, two of 'em! They got O'Brien and Cocksey, nothing stops them!

122
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:23,746
It's Staff Arnold!

123
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:24,817
Yeah, come on.

124
00:22:32,214 --> 00:22:32,686
Captain?

125
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:33,420
Yeti!

126
00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:34,247
They got two of us!

127
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:35,412
And the ammo detail - they're all gone.

128
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:36,730
What's the plan then?

129
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:40,584
I brought a load of explosives down from Holborn. I'm going to blow it - and them with it.

130
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:42,452
Taking a bit of a risk, aren't you, sir?

131
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:43,658
Yeah, I know.

132
00:22:43,874 --> 00:22:45,222
Hey, look what's happening!

133
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:50,036
What are they doing?

134
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,338
Looks like the cobwebs!

135
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:01,711
Cobwebs or not, I'm going to blow it sky high. Get back!

136
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:14,771
What's that noise?

137
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,233
The boxes are pulsating!

138
00:23:24,105 --> 00:23:25,194
Get back!

139
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:41,914
This waiting's getting on my nerves. Why the heck don't they do something?

140
00:23:42,177 --> 00:23:44,370
Steady, lad. We'll know soon enough.

141
00:23:44,587 --> 00:23:46,979
We can't just stand here. Can't we make a run for it?

142
00:23:47,195 --> 00:23:49,079
We wouldn't stand a chance, not with them switched on.

143
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:50,766
How do you know that?

144
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:55,965
It's alright, sir. The Professor's vouched for him. Understand he knows a great deal about these robots.

145
00:23:56,146 --> 00:23:57,487
See, you have to find out...

146
00:23:57,762 --> 00:23:58,727
What's that?

147
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:20,307
What made them do that, I wonder?

148
00:24:20,487 --> 00:24:23,946
Couldn't say, sir. But I don't think we should stay to find out.

149
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:26,629
Yes, you're right, Staff. Come on, let's get back.

150
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,132
Wait - can we not just see what they're up to?

151
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:34,705
No! If there's one thing that I've learned, it's never push your luck. Now come on.

152
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:07,965
Soldier!

153
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,272
Well, there's a sight for sore eyes!

154
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:15,142
Are you stark raving mad?

155
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:17,401
Aye, well I always sing when I'm scared, see.

156
00:25:17,612 --> 00:25:19,268
Stand to attention when you're talking to an officer!

157
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:20,742
Name and serial!

158
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:21,822
6-0...

159
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:22,882
Shush!

160
00:25:23,082 --> 00:25:24,387
6-0-1 Evans, sir!

161
00:25:24,554 --> 00:25:26,255
Evans? Anybody know him?

162
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:28,142
Oh, I'm not one of your lot, sir.

163
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:29,827
Then what are you doing down here?

164
00:25:30,102 --> 00:25:31,548
Trying to get out, Sarge!

165
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:35,295
Don't try to be funny with me, lad! How did you get down here in the first place?

166
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:50,644
Driver on the ammo truck to Holborn. Got jumped, we did - quite a dust up, there was.
Couldn't get past them hairy creatures, see? Been wandering for hours. Lost, I was.
I tried one way, but there seemed to be some sort of cobweb muck moving down the tunnel.

167
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:52,688
Moving? Are you sure it was moving?

168
00:25:52,848 --> 00:26:00,851
Well of course I'm sure!... sir. Sounds daft, I know,
but it seemed to be following a Yeti that had a kind of pointed glass thing in its hands.

169
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:02,068
Was it shaped like a pyramid?

170
00:26:02,257 --> 00:26:03,265
Well, I suppose it was, really.

171
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:05,878
Well that's it! Smash the pyramid, and you put the Intelligence out of action!

172
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:06,879
What Intelligence?

173
00:26:07,064 --> 00:26:08,261
Whereabouts did you say this happened?

174
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:09,499
Kings Cross, Staff.

175
00:26:09,664 --> 00:26:10,255
What!

176
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:11,628
Headquarters, sir - HQ may be in danger!

177
00:26:11,801 --> 00:26:13,270
Yes, we'd better get back as soon as we can. Come on.

178
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:13,912
No, look...

179
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,542
Now listen to what the officer said, young man. Come on!

180
00:26:15,753 --> 00:26:18,270
Look, I came down here to find the Doctor. I'm not going back till I have!

181
00:26:18,455 --> 00:26:19,112
Now look here...

182
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:21,342
No, I'm not going! And if I get a chance to smash that pyramid, I will!

183
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:22,622
That's quite a risk you're taking.

184
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:24,062
Aye, but it's me that's taking it.

185
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,842
Alright, it's your neck, chum.

186
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:26,585
Sir!

187
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:27,371
Yes?

188
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,522
I'd like to volunteer to go with the young gentleman, sir.

189
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:33,098
Well, you're not one of my lot... alright. Come on, the rest of you.

190
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:46,473
Monument! Then it's Tower Hill next.

191
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:52,389
Wait a minute! Did you hear something?

192
00:26:52,883 --> 00:26:53,622
What?

193
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:54,812
Listen.

194
00:26:58,978 --> 00:27:01,917
Look! The fungus, it's here!

195
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:06,427
We'd better get out, fast!

196
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,500
- Jamie!  - Doctor! Good to see you!
