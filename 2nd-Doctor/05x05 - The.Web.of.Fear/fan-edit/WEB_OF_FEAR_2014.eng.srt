3
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:13,498
- Mr Silverstein?   - Yes. Who are you?

4
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:16,227
Anne Travers. Is my father here?

5
00:00:16,387 --> 00:00:20,619
Yes, he's here. Come and see him and take him away.

6
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,778
He's a fool. An old fool!

7
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:25,461
Father?

8
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:28,698
Father...

9
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:31,618
Anne...

10
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:35,663
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

11
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,176
You were supposed to be meeting me.

12
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:42,779
- Was I?   - At the airport.

13
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:48,440
Father, what is the matter? You send me a cable saying you're in grave trouble.

14
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,622
- And I fly half the way round the world...
- Trouble? Yes.

15
00:00:51,787 --> 00:00:55,905
A great deal of trouble. It's that thing.

16
00:00:56,587 --> 00:00:58,578
- The Yeti?   - Mm.

17
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:02,423
You're a stupid old fool, Julius Silverstein!

18
00:01:02,787 --> 00:01:07,581
ME the fool? You would like me to be the fool and give you back my Yeti, huh?

19
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:11,237
You must, man. Don't you understand? It's dangerous.

20
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:16,925
For 30 years this stands here in my museum, and now he tells me it is dangerous!

21
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:21,478
- I wish I'd never brought it back from Tibet.
- Father, what has happened?

22
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:26,084
The silly old goat won't listen to me. I've told him, warned him.

23
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:31,162
- Damn it, he knows it's a robot!
- But, Father, the Yeti isn't dangerous.

24
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:34,364
It can't work unless it has a control unit.

25
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,802
But I've done it, Anne!

26
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:39,356
I HAVE reactivated the control unit.

27
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:43,041
But, Father, this is wonderful news.

28
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:46,677
Is it? Yes, I suppose it would be, except for one thing.

29
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:48,838
What?

30
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:50,804
The sphere - it's gone!

31
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:55,199
It's disappeared! You must let me have the Yeti back, Julius.

32
00:01:57,447 --> 00:01:59,244
Make him understand, Anne!

33
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:01,398
I understand.

34
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:04,240
I buy the Yeti off you 30 years ago.

35
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:07,001
Now, it is valuable.

36
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:10,557
You try to scare me, take your Yeti back.

37
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:14,318
Why? Money! You want to rob me!

38
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:17,085
I'll buy the thing back if that's what you want!

39
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:21,159
No, no. It's priceless.

40
00:02:21,327 --> 00:02:24,080
The only one in the world, and it is mine.

41
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:26,044
- You fool!  - Thief!

42
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:28,516
- I'm not a thief.   - Swindler!

43
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:30,040
Stubborn old goat!

44
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:33,756
- Father!   - Take him away - out of my house!

45
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:36,818
Father, perhaps you've made a mistake.

46
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:40,738
You've put the sphere away somewhere in your laboratory and forgotten it.

47
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:44,277
- You've done it before.
- No. I've looked everywhere.

48
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:48,886
Let's go home and look again, shall we? You know what you're like.

49
00:02:48,947 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes, but suppose...

50
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:54,240
Let's go and have a quiet dinner, and you can tell me all about it.

51
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,080
Then we'll go home and look for the sphere.

52
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:01,722
Well, all right... But I warned you, Julius! I warned you!

53
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:03,559
Get out! Take him away!

54
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:07,606
Nobody destroys Julius Silverstein's collection! Nobody!

55
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:10,042
- Come on, Father.
- The Yeti's mine!

56
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:12,767
You can't scare me with your mad stories.

57
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:15,997
Out! Out!

58
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:49,841
Travers...

59
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:53,856
It is you? I am not frightened by your stupid tricks!

60
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:55,718
Travers! I know it's you.

61
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,240
I'm not a fool!

62
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:26,679
Agh!

67
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:11,978
Some sort of grille.

68
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:15,181
Don't say you've landed us in a prison!

69
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:17,656
It could be the dungeons of a castle.

70
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:19,180
It's so dark.

71
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:21,338
Ah, steps.

72
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:23,816
Come along. Be careful.

73
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:33,105
Yes...

74
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,458
It seems to be a large room.

75
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,618
Tiled walls.

76
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:39,778
Curved ceiling.

77
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:41,858
Come on.

78
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,538
The floor seems to end here.

79
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:52,416
There's a sort of trench. Look.

80
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:57,224
- Hey, Doctor. Come and look at this.
- What have you found, Victoria?

81
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:59,178
See for yourself.

82
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:05,177
"Covent... Garden... "
"科文特...花园..."

83
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:10,785
Yes, of course! It's an underground station. We're standing on the platform.

84
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:13,780
- Underground station?   - Underground trains.

85
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:17,986
- A little after your time, Victoria.
- Is it always as dark as this?

86
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:22,743
No, it's probably the middle of the night. Come on. Let's go up top.

87
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:30,855
- Professor Travers is here, sir.
- Why have I been brought here? Who are you?

88
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,904
- Knight.       - Never heard of you.

89
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:35,058
Captain Knight. OK, Corporal.

90
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:37,984
It's no good shouting at me.

91
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,536
- I didn't ask for you.   - Who did, then?

92
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:44,222
- Your daughter.   - Anne? Just like her mother.

93
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:46,298
Always interfering in things she knows nothing about!

94
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:49,425
I understood that you'd sent for her to come back from merica to help you.

95
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:51,225
What do you want me for, anyway?

96
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:53,860
I don't. I consider this to be a military matter.

97
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,860
Well, you haven't much success so far, haven you?

98
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:05,861
Army? What the devil do they know about it?

99
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:14,305
- The Doctor was wrong!
- It's not night-time. It's broad daylight.

100
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:20,897
- Just let me get my breath... Those stairs!
- It looks like we're locked in.

101
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:22,878
- That's strange.  - Doctor...

102
00:07:23,347 --> 00:07:25,861
- Yes?    - Listen.

103
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:27,540
I can't hear anything.

104
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:32,020
Oh... It IS quiet. I see what you mean.

105
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,620
The middle of London. There should be some noise.

106
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:38,840
Hey, Doctor. There's an old man over there. Let's ask him.

107
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:40,818
Yes, go on.

108
00:07:42,787 --> 00:07:44,459
Excuse me...

109
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:47,618
Excuse me...

110
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:52,844
Who are you?

111
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,616
- Harold Chorley. London Television.
- Oh, What?

112
00:07:55,637 --> 00:07:58,426
Television? Never watch it. Are you an actor or something?

113
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:01,526
Journalist, actually.

114
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:07,184
The government decided to only allow one correspondent down here. The press chose me.

115
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:08,824
Oh, yeah?

116
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:14,777
Tell me, Professor, will you be in charge of the scientific  ection, or will your daughter?

117
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:17,138
Mind your own business!

118
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:21,600
And how long do you think it will take you to come up with the answer?

119
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,382
- One week? Three, perhaps?
- How the hell should I know?

120
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:27,778
- Is that working?
- Of course.

121
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,860
It's more than likely we may not be able to defeat this menace.

122
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:37,303
London...perhaps the whole of England might be completely wiped out. There - did you get that?

123
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:02,199
- What are you doing, Doctor?
- Just confirming something.

124
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:07,185
Yes, just as I thought. There haven't been any trains here for some time.

125
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,238
What's that over there?

126
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:19,120
It's a power cable. I wonder what it's doing down here.

127
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:21,278
In there quickly!

128
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:58,563
Soldiers? I wonder what they're doing down here.

129
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:03,198
- Let's go and ask them.
- No. I think we'd better tread carefully.

130
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:06,120
Let's go and find out what's going on first.

131
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,117
What do you want us to do, Doctor?

132
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:20,882
You follow the soldiers, but keep out of sight.

133
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:22,667
I'm going to see where this cable goes to.

134
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,667
Meet back here in a few minutes. Right?

135
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:39,645
- What's the matter?
- I thought I heard something.

136
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:44,244
- Getting a bit jumpy, aren't you, Weams?
- It's no wonder, is it, Staff?

137
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:48,161
- Shall we connect the new drum now, Staff?
- All right, Corporal.

138
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:52,486
- Good thing we fixed these lights.
- Yeah. You said that again.

139
00:10:58,487 --> 00:11:02,082
- I can't hear anything.
- Are they still there?

140
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:05,080
I think they must be moving. Come on.

141
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:08,325
Agh!

142
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:13,483
I told you I heard something, didn't I?

143
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,358
Yeah. Come on!

144
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:19,166
- I'm sorry!   - It was only a cobweb!

145
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:23,366
- Do you think they heard?
- Hope not. Come on.

146
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:37,621
Well, well, well, would you believe it? The Babes in the Wood!
好, 好, 好, 你能相信不？树林中的美女!

147
00:13:05,227 --> 00:13:10,198
- You're quite sure there was nobody with you?
- How many more times?

148
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:12,264
That's all right, then.

149
00:13:13,387 --> 00:13:16,897
- Clear to fire, Staff?
- Yes, they were on their own.

150
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:19,058
Right.

151
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:21,018
What was all that about?

152
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:26,340
I suppose there's no harm in telling you. You two are very lucky.

153
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:29,060
- We're going to blow up the tunnel.
- What?!

154
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:31,866
- That's what the cable's for.
- The Doctor!

155
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:41,225
It's all right. They were on their own. OK, let's not waste any more time. Off you go.

156
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:45,018
Agh!

157
00:13:49,476 --> 00:13:53,498
A doctor! Well, if he was anywhere near those explosives when they went up...

158
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,684
Yes sir. Don't you think I should go and have a look, sir?

159
00:13:55,742 --> 00:13:58,384
The youngsters said he was following the cable.

160
00:13:58,623 --> 00:13:59,672
Yes, you'd better.

161
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:00,443
Sir!

162
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,994
Oh, and Staff, take someone with you.

163
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,143
Sir!

164
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:17,659
- Father?  - Hmm?

165
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,623
The soldiers have found two youngsters in the tunnels.

166
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,923
They seem to know a great deal about the Yeti.

167
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:22,938
Oh?

168
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:24,445
They know they're robots!

169
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:25,104
What!

170
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:27,484
And they know about the control spheres, too.

171
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:30,369
But they can't have - I mean, the public were never told!

172
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:31,336
I know.

173
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Where are they?

174
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,479
Hello, hello, Holborn?...

175
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:44,979
This is HQ to Holborn. Can you hear me?... Not a sausage.

176
00:14:45,346 --> 00:14:46,805
There must be someone manning the phone.

177
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:48,938
OK, Lane, what gives?

178
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:50,507
Well, it's just firing at the other end, sir.

179
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:52,373
- Firing?  - Yes, sir. Listen.

180
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,486
Oh, good grief, no!

181
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,633
Hello, HQ to Holborn?

182
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:18,081
What happened, Lane?

183
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,514
Well, it was difficult to hear, sir. I think the truck was late getting there...

184
00:15:20,718 --> 00:15:21,428
Then what?

185
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:24,937
Well they must have got the ammo unloaded, sir, 'cos he says they were jumped when they were leaving.

186
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:26,481
Take O'Brien and a couple of the others.

187
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:27,930
Sir! Come on, mate.

188
00:15:30,683 --> 00:15:31,928
Here, you're not going out there?

189
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:36,584
Yes, Mr Chorley. Want to come? Report some action first hand?

190
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,644
Well, I don't think I'd better get in the way. I...

191
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,444
I think I'd better stay here, don't you?

192
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:42,704
Yes. Yes, I think you better had.

193
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:48,777
Father?

194
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:52,093
But it... it can't be...

195
00:15:53,448 --> 00:16:00,301
Why... that's... that's over... forty years ago!

196
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,700
What's going on here?

197
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:05,524
Oh Jamie, don't you recognise him? It's Professor Travers.

198
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:10,776
So it is! Professor Travers! Here, hasn't he got old!

199
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:11,510
Huh?

200
00:16:11,694 --> 00:16:14,635
Oh, but we're very pleased to see you, Professor, very pleased.

201
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:20,038
The time machine... it was all true then?

202
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:24,654
The TARDIS - I mean aye, of course it's true! Hey, do you know what's happened to the Doctor?

203
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:25,474
Oh, is he safe?

204
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:26,346
Isn't he with you?

205
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:29,596
No, he's in the tunnels. Arnold's gone to look for him. Father, what is going on?

206
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:33,182
Oh dear, I do hope he's alright. Come on, Jamie, let's go and find out if he's got back yet.

207
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,328
Father!

208
00:16:37,835 --> 00:16:40,887
Eh? Oh, Victoria, try and explain to Anne, will you?

209
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:42,315
Oh dear!

210
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:01,724
There hasn't been an explosion, Staff!

211
00:17:02,143 --> 00:17:03,873
I can see that, lad... Here!

212
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:17,076
No sign of that Doctor bloke.

213
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:20,552
No... here, give me a hand with this.

214
00:17:22,523 --> 00:17:25,559
It's our detonator, alright. It's fired, too...

215
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:32,059
'ere, hang on a minute. All the ammo, Staff. If it's fired, then why didn't...

216
00:17:32,274 --> 00:17:35,778
Yeah, why didn't this tunnel go up?... No damage at all...

217
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:38,066
Yet something blew up here!

218
00:17:38,454 --> 00:17:42,467
It's obvious, ain't it? It's been got at.

219
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,651
Where's that Doctor? That's what I'd like to know.

220
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,544
Tibet? Tibet? You're joking.

221
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:54,219
That's where old Travers says they come from. He reckons they're Abominable Snowmen.

222
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:57,642
Well, he's off his chump, ain't he? How'd they get here in the first place?

223
00:17:57,853 --> 00:17:59,025
Come through the post, don't they?

224
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,740
Nah, seriously. Outer space, that's where they come from. Well that's what I reckon, anyway.

225
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,912
Oh do leave off! You've been reading too many kids' comics, you have!

226
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,182
Alright then, Corp, where do they come from?

227
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:13,808
It's a foreign power, ain't it? Bacteriological warfare, that's what that stuff is in the tunnels.

228
00:18:14,065 --> 00:18:15,175
What, that fungus stuff?

229
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:19,448
Yeah. And them Yeti are some sort of new weapon. Well, a sort of robot army.

230
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,093
What, you mean it ain't real then?

231
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:23,597
Well of course they ain't, you nit!

232
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:25,997
Otherwise we'd be able to knock 'em out with the small arms, wouldn't we?

233
00:18:26,193 --> 00:18:27,897
Yeah - nothing hardly touches 'em, does it?

234
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:30,497
Not unless you can cop 'em straight between the eyes. Then they've had it.

235
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:32,969
Father?

236
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:33,704
Hmm?

237
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:36,433
Have you ever seen this TARDIS?

238
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:39,493
No, no, I can't say I have.

239
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:42,034
It all sounds a bit far-fetched to me.

240
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:45,074
You know, I think the Doctor's at the back of all this.

241
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,270
What do you mean?

242
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:50,815
Doesn't it strike you as odd that on the two occasions you've encountered the Yeti, you've also come across the Doctor?

243
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:51,981
Well?

244
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,278
Well, it's obvious - he controls them!

245
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,812
Oh, but surely...

246
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:59,188
What? Oh, tea. Thank you, my dear.

247
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:01,966
Oh, aren't you having any?

248
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,792
No, I think I'll go and lie down for a bit.

249
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:06,215
Good idea.

250
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,187
Do you think she heard?

251
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:14,428
No... in any case, what you say is nonsense, Anne.

252
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:19,728
I saw the Doctor defeat those robots and save Detsen Monastery.

253
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:22,828
He wouldn't do that if he was in league with them, now would he?

254
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,213
No, no I suppose not.

255
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:29,079
Here, Corp, look at this!

256
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:37,049
What... oh crikey! That's what comes of talking about it!

257
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:39,187
It's that fungus stuff, it's moving again!

258
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:45,660
Don't worry!

259
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:49,470
Can't help it - I feel... responsible somehow.

260
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:53,470
If only the Doctor would turn up. I'm sure he could help us.

261
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,663
'Scuse me, sir...

262
00:19:55,858 --> 00:19:56,613
Eh, what?

263
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:59,801
That fungus stuff, it's on the move again. Euston Square's gone.

264
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:01,131
Come on, let's have a look!

265
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,093
It's on the move again, Weams?

266
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:09,905
Yes, sir. Kings Cross has gone, and it's moving on to Farringdon.

267
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:11,946
It's never moved as fast as this before!

268
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:13,612
Hasn't moved at all the last three weeks, Miss.

269
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:15,043
What started it up again all of a sudden?

270
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:16,109
Can't say.

271
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:20,647
Strange, isn't it, that all this should happen on the very day that your mysterious Doctor friend turns up?

272
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:22,038
He hasn't turned up.

273
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:25,745
Precisely. He could have sent those kids in here as spies.

274
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,820
Rubbish! Would Jamie go away and leave Victoria, if he didn't intend coming back again?

275
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,584
Excuse me, sir, but where is the young lady?

276
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:33,173
Oh, in the Common Room, I suppose.

277
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:35,509
No she's not, 'cos I went in there when I was looking for you!

278
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:38,699
What? Well... where is she then?

279
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:57,471
Jamie? Doctor?... Jamie? Doctor?

280
00:20:57,892 --> 00:20:58,630
Victoria!

281
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,465
Oh, Doctor, thank goodness I found you! Are you alright?

282
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:03,324
Look, sir, the fungus! It's moving again!

283
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:09,930
Hope the Captain and Staff Arnold ain't anywhere near that little lot.

284
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:15,390
Lane? Lane! Fall back, you'll never hold them!

285
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,571
Will nothing stop them?

286
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:39,507
Come on, back!

287
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,931
We couldn't hold 'em, sir. They're coming, two of 'em!

288
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:19,931
They got O'Brien and Cocksey, nothing stops them!

289
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:23,746
It's Staff Arnold!

290
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:24,817
Yeah, come on.

291
00:22:32,214 --> 00:22:32,686
Captain?

292
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:33,420
Yeti!

293
00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:34,247
They got two of us!

294
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:35,412
And the ammo detail - they're all gone.

295
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:36,730
What's the plan then?

296
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:40,584
I brought a load of explosives down from Holborn. I'm going to blow it - and them with it.

297
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:42,452
Taking a bit of a risk, aren't you, sir?

298
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:43,658
Yeah, I know.

299
00:22:43,874 --> 00:22:45,222
Hey, look what's happening!

300
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:50,036
What are they doing?

301
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,338
Looks like the cobwebs!

302
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:01,711
Cobwebs or not, I'm going to blow it sky high. Get back!

303
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:14,771
What's that noise?

304
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,233
The boxes are pulsating!

305
00:23:24,105 --> 00:23:25,194
Get back!

306
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:41,914
This waiting's getting on my nerves. Why the heck don't they do something?

307
00:23:42,177 --> 00:23:44,670
Steady, lad. We'll know soon enough.

308
00:23:44,887 --> 00:23:46,979
We can't just stand here. Can't we make a run for it?

309
00:23:47,195 --> 00:23:49,079
We wouldn't stand a chance, not with them switched on.

310
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:50,766
How do you know that?

311
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:56,165
It's alright, sir. The Professor's vouched for him. Understand he knows a great deal about these robots.

312
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:57,487
See, you have to find out...

313
00:23:57,762 --> 00:23:58,727
What's that?

314
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:20,307
What made them do that, I wonder?

315
00:24:20,487 --> 00:24:23,946
Couldn't say, sir. But I don't think we should stay to find out.

316
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:26,629
Yes, you're right, Staff. Come on, let's get back.

317
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,132
Wait - can we not just see what they're up to?

318
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:34,705
No! If there's one thing that I've learned, it's never push your luck. Now come on.

319
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:53,514
What is it, sir?

320
00:24:53,729 --> 00:24:54,416
Quiet! Listen.

321
00:24:57,244 --> 00:24:58,545
Quick, get in here.

322
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:07,965
Soldier!

323
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,272
Well, there's a sight for sore eyes!

324
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:15,142
Are you stark raving mad?

325
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:17,401
Aye, well I always sing when I'm scared, see.

326
00:25:17,612 --> 00:25:19,268
Stand to attention when you're talking to an officer!

327
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:20,742
Name and serial!

328
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:22,322
- 6-0...  - Shush!

329
00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:24,387
6-0-1 Evans, sir!

330
00:25:24,554 --> 00:25:26,255
Evans? Anybody know him?

331
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:28,142
Oh, I'm not one of your lot, sir.

332
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:29,827
Then what are you doing down here?

333
00:25:30,102 --> 00:25:31,548
Trying to get out, Sarge!

334
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:35,295
Don't try to be funny with me, lad! How did you get down here in the first place?

335
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:40,144
Driver on the ammo truck to Holborn. Got jumped, we did - quite a dust up, there was.

336
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:46,444
Couldn't get past them hairy creatures, see? Been wandering for hours. Lost, I was.

337
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:50,644
I tried one way, but there seemed to be some sort of cobweb muck moving down the tunnel.

338
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:52,688
Moving? Are you sure it was moving?

339
00:25:52,848 --> 00:25:56,851
Well of course I'm sure!... sir. Sounds daft, I know,

340
00:25:56,948 --> 00:26:00,851
but it seemed to be following a Yeti that had a kind of pointed glass thing in its hands.

341
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:02,068
Was it shaped like a pyramid?

342
00:26:02,257 --> 00:26:03,265
Well, I suppose it was, really.

343
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:05,878
Well that's it! Smash the pyramid, and you put the Intelligence out of action!

344
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:06,879
What Intelligence?

345
00:26:07,064 --> 00:26:08,261
Whereabouts did you say this happened?

346
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:09,499
Kings Cross, Staff.

347
00:26:09,664 --> 00:26:10,255
What!

348
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:11,628
Headquarters, sir - HQ may be in danger!

349
00:26:11,801 --> 00:26:13,270
Yes, we'd better get back as soon as we can. Come on.

350
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:13,912
No, look...

351
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,542
Now listen to what the officer said, young man. Come on!

352
00:26:15,753 --> 00:26:18,270
Look, I came down here to find the Doctor. I'm not going back till I have!

353
00:26:18,455 --> 00:26:19,112
Now look here...

354
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:21,342
No, I'm not going! And if I get a chance to smash that pyramid, I will!

355
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:22,622
That's quite a risk you're taking.

356
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:24,062
Aye, but it's me that's taking it.

357
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,842
Alright, it's your neck, chum.

358
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:26,585
Sir!

359
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:27,371
Yes?

360
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,522
I'd like to volunteer to go with the young gentleman, sir.

361
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:33,098
Well, you're not one of my lot... alright. Come on, the rest of you.

362
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:46,473
Monument! Then it's Tower Hill next.

363
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:52,389
Wait a minute! Did you hear something?

364
00:26:52,883 --> 00:26:53,622
What?

365
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:54,812
Listen.

366
00:26:58,978 --> 00:27:01,917
Look! The fungus, it's here!

367
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:06,427
We'd better get out, fast!

368
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,500
- Jamie!  - Doctor! Good to see you!

369
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:26,612
All right, Corporal. Nip back and tell Captain Knight it's all clear up 'ere. And get 'em to get a shift on!

370
00:27:26,623 --> 00:27:27,646
Righto, Staff.

371
00:27:30,636 --> 00:27:32,449
This looks familiar - it's around this corner.

372
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:33,922
Oh no!

373
00:27:34,443 --> 00:27:35,811
Oh, we can't get to the TARDIS!

374
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:39,465
No, Victoria, I'm afraid we can't.

375
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:41,499
What's happened to Chorley, then?

376
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:47,495
That's what I'm wondering. Did he reach the TARDIS before the fungus, or... or did he not?

377
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:50,452
You mean to say, he could have got to the TARDIS and already have taken off in it?

378
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:51,896
I don't know...

379
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:53,060
Hey, come back, Doctor!

380
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:55,526
It's alright, Jamie, I'm not going to do anything silly. I...

381
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:58,326
I just want to try and get a little bit for an analysis.

382
00:27:58,618 --> 00:27:59,616
Oh Jamie, stop him!

383
00:27:59,843 --> 00:28:01,027
It's alright, Victoria.

384
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,083
Has anyone got a box?

385
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:06,976
I've got my tobacco tin.

386
00:28:07,315 --> 00:28:08,515
Oh, splendid.

387
00:28:08,742 --> 00:28:09,974
But then, it's got tobacco in it.

388
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:10,888
Never mind.

389
00:28:11,112 --> 00:28:16,858
Eh!... Oh, alright. I only hope you think the sacrifice is worth it!

390
00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:19,996
Hold the tin for me, would you, Evans?

391
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,627
Gone and set it off! Come on, now!

392
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:27,687
Oh, it's horrible!

393
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:29,888
Go on, Doctor, get it out!

394
00:28:30,103 --> 00:28:31,065
Hold the tin underneath!

395
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:34,596
There we are - now back, everyone, quickly!

396
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:43,686
Hello, Staff. It's alright, it's just Staff Arnold!

397
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:48,776
One of these days, Evans my lad, you're going to creep up onto someone once too often!

398
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:50,830
Well, that's life, innit Staff?

399
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:52,074
Any luck at Holborn?

400
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:53,197
No - fungus.

401
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,365
Same back there.

402
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,090
Right. I'll tell the Colonel. You lot had better get back to HQ.

403
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,590
We'll be along in a few minutes.

404
00:28:58,855 --> 00:29:01,176
Come on, Jamie, I'll just show this bit of fungus to Travers.

405
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:01,992
Right.

406
00:29:06,729 --> 00:29:08,683
Hey, look at this!

407
00:29:09,094 --> 00:29:11,574
Good Lord! That's Yeti!

408
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:13,791
You don't think they may still be here?

409
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:14,717
I hope not!

410
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:16,028
Oh, Doctor!

411
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,632
D'you reckon they have?

412
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:25,783
Have what?

413
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:27,535
Taken him? Like she said?

414
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,563
Yes, I'm very much afraid they have.

415
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:35,563
But why? Why didn't they just kill him? Unless...

416
00:29:35,812 --> 00:29:36,695
Yes?

417
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:38,898
Well, unless they had a use for him.

418
00:29:40,658 --> 00:29:42,758
Ah, Doctor. What's this I hear about Travers?

419
00:29:50,106 --> 00:29:52,090
'Scuse me, sir, but I think you ought to come to the Ops Room.

420
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:53,219
Why? What's happening?

421
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,231
That fungus stuff, it's on the move again!

422
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:08,744
It's like a spider's web, ain't it?

423
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:13,454
Yes. And we're the flies, alright, but... where is the spider?

424
00:30:13,876 --> 00:30:15,614
Better give the others a hand, Corporal.

425
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:16,429
Sir.

426
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:20,890
Doctor. Been thinking about what you were saying earlier,

427
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:24,690
about someone here in HQ being responsible for all this.

428
00:30:24,751 --> 00:30:25,690
Could it have been Travers?

429
00:30:26,184 --> 00:30:27,024
I doubt it.

430
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:29,716
Well, after all he has disappeared.

431
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:34,815
Yes - so has Chorley. I'd say he was a much more likely suspect.

432
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:35,877
True.

433
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,071
On the other hand, of course, whoever is in league with the Intelligence

434
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,471
could still be amongst us here.

435
00:30:42,782 --> 00:30:45,822
That's a fact of which I am uncomfortably aware.

436
00:30:45,882 --> 00:30:49,822
But tell me, Doctor, this Intelligence - exactly what is it?

437
00:30:50,404 --> 00:30:53,617
Well I wish I could give you a precise answer.

438
00:30:53,704 --> 00:30:58,617
Perhaps the best way to describe it is a sort of formless, shapeless thing

439
00:30:58,704 --> 00:31:04,917
floating about in space like a cloud of mist, only... with a mind and will.

440
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:06,810
What's it after? What's it want?

441
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:11,352
I wish I knew. The only thing I know for sure is that it brought me here.

442
00:31:11,854 --> 00:31:13,074
Brought you here?

443
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:15,438
Yes, been wondering how you got here.

444
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:20,471
Yes, well I... I don't think there's any harm in telling you now. I...

445
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:23,971
I have a craft, that travels in time and space.

446
00:31:25,023 --> 00:31:27,253
Oh, come now Doctor, you can't expect me to...

447
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:32,134
This craft of yours, this time-space craft. Could it get us out of here?

448
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,418
Well, yes - but it's at Covent Garden!

449
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:37,006
What does it look like?

450
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:39,345
It's a police box.

451
00:31:39,612 --> 00:31:41,464
Oh really, Colonel, surely you're not...

452
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:45,012
So - if we could rescue that craft, you could take us out?

453
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,018
Yes, yes I could, but I have to stay here and finish Travers' work!

454
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:54,409
Ah, Doctor. Miss Travers is feeling alright now, and would like to see you right away.

455
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:57,184
Very good, Jamie. Excuse me, gentlemen, please.

456
00:31:57,453 --> 00:31:57,967
Yes.

457
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:02,095
Well, I've heard some stories in my time, but that one really takes...

458
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:03,193
So you don't believe him?

459
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:07,269
No, of course not, sir! The whole idea is screwy. A police box!

460
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:11,024
Well whether you think it foolish or not, we are going to rescue that craft.

461
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,837
Oh, but sir! Our job...

462
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:15,433
Captain Knight. The Army has failed to defeat this menace.

463
00:32:15,526 --> 00:32:18,833
Now the Doctor thinks he might succeed. Personally, I doubt it.

464
00:32:18,926 --> 00:32:20,633
But if we stay here, we're as good as dead.

465
00:32:20,726 --> 00:32:23,633
Therefore I do not intend leaving any escape route unexplored,

466
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,633
however... screwy you may think it.

467
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:26,774
Oh, surely Colonel...

468
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:28,411
Let's get on with it, shall we, Knight?

469
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:29,432
Sir.

470
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:36,914
But... but there must be a chance! If the Doctor says...

471
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:42,254
No, the soldiers could comb these tunnels for a fortnight and still never find him.

472
00:32:42,358 --> 00:32:45,554
I'm afraid your father's been taken by the Intelligence.

473
00:32:45,658 --> 00:32:51,054
The only way that we can save him is by finding the central control source.

474
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:53,046
Aye, if it's anywhere, that's where he'll be.

475
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:57,180
But why? Why him? Why not me, or one of the soldiers, or...

476
00:32:57,357 --> 00:33:04,321
Yes, I know. Tell me, what was your father working on

477
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,121
just before the Yeti broke in, Anne?

478
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:11,360
Um... oh, we were ready to test the sphere with the control unit,

479
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,960
but I don't see what this has to do with anything, Doctor.

480
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:17,721
But don't you? If he was near to success...

481
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:19,006
That's why they took him!

482
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,665
Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?

483
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,565
Now Anne, do you feel strong enough to come back to the laboratory?

484
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:24,779
Yes, yes of course.

485
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:25,732
Anything we can do?

486
00:33:25,906 --> 00:33:26,883
No, no, you just take it easy, Jamie.

487
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:31,037
What's the matter?

488
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:33,361
I've been thinking about what the Doctor said.

489
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:36,561
Anything we do, the Intelligence always knows!

490
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:40,379
Aye, but I wouldn't let it worry you. The Doctor will soon find a way out.

491
00:33:40,828 --> 00:33:42,321
I wish I could believe that.

492
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:48,926
Oh yes. Yes, this seems to be in order, Anne.

493
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:55,289
My father didn't want it put together until this was in proper order.

494
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,144
Very wise. Let's have a look at this...

495
00:33:58,261 --> 00:34:03,225
Oh yes, yes... My word, this is a splendid piece of work, Anne.

496
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:03,934
Thank you.

497
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,307
Yes, this should control the sphere, alright.

498
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:09,207
But would it override the commands issued by the Intelligence, I wonder?

499
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:12,840
No. No, I'm afraid it won't. I just didn't have the time. Do you think we can do it.

500
00:34:13,028 --> 00:34:15,329
Oh, we can do it, if you've got the right bits and pieces.

501
00:34:16,022 --> 00:34:18,997
Hope I'm not disturbing, Doctor, but Staff asked me to give you this.

502
00:34:20,632 --> 00:34:21,750
Where'd you get this?

503
00:34:21,985 --> 00:34:24,211
On the floor, by that young lad Weams, it was.

504
00:34:24,788 --> 00:34:27,578
But this is what brought the Yeti to the explosives store!

505
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:31,578
It's obviously been reprogrammed as a homing device, and you've given it to me!

506
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,149
Here! You don't think I had anything to do with these Yeti, do you?

507
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,675
Doctor! The other models - they've gone!

508
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:44,404
Well don't look at me! I didn't want to come down here in the first place

509
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:47,804
I shouldn't be down here at all, really. Driver, I am, see.

510
00:34:47,872 --> 00:34:50,304
You'd better have this, before you say I've nicked it.

511
00:34:50,694 --> 00:34:51,533
Thank you.

512
00:34:51,795 --> 00:34:53,753
And I'll have the tin back, when you've finished with it.

513
00:34:54,378 --> 00:34:58,034
Don't look so unhappy - we're all under suspicion, you know, including me.

514
00:34:58,275 --> 00:34:58,948
Hmm!

515
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:01,373
What's in the tin, Doctor?

516
00:35:01,777 --> 00:35:05,907
It's the fungus from the tunnel. I thought if we examined it, it might give us a clue.

517
00:35:05,977 --> 00:35:10,007
I must get this dismantled. It's like holding a time bomb.

518
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:16,962
So my party will get above ground and approach Covent Garden by Neal Street. Is that clear?

519
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,586
Now Staff here will be taking the trolley through the tunnel,

520
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,586
and will arrive, we hope, at the same time as we do. You picked your two men, Staff?

521
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,259
Yes, sir. Lane and Evans.

522
00:35:25,772 --> 00:35:29,099
Right. Now as soon as we get there, we shall be looking for a police box.

523
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:30,432
A police box, sir?

524
00:35:30,594 --> 00:35:32,536
Yes, a police box. Now I want that box either out of the station

525
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,036
and onto the trolley as quickly as possible. Is that understood?

526
00:35:35,114 --> 00:35:35,670
Yes, sir.

527
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:36,572
Right. Any questions?

528
00:35:36,747 --> 00:35:39,075
Yes, sir, this, um... police box. Is it important?

529
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:42,410
Corporal Blake, we'd hardly be going to this trouble if it weren't.

530
00:35:43,158 --> 00:35:45,017
Who's going to look after the civilians, sir?

531
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:47,813
I'd like you to stay behind and look after them, Captain Knight.

532
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:51,513
The Doctor's got work to do. Right gentlemen, time to go.

533
00:35:51,657 --> 00:35:52,935
- Ah, Doctor.   - Oh Jamie, what is it?

534
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:54,395
The Colonel says to tell you he's on his way.

535
00:35:54,575 --> 00:35:55,572
On his way where?

536
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,029
To rescue the TARDIS!

537
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,009
He's wasting his time.

538
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:00,751
Well that's what I told him. And I think that man Chorley must be behind...

539
00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:04,471
Now look! Get behind me, both of you, and keep clear. Here we go...

540
00:36:07,724 --> 00:36:08,484
No!

541
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,581
What is it, Doctor?

542
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:14,588
The tin's empty!... Evans!

543
00:36:16,223 --> 00:36:18,912
Course, really I shouldn't be doing this, you know, Staff.

544
00:36:19,023 --> 00:36:20,912
Not officially on the strength down here, see.

545
00:36:21,023 --> 00:36:22,912
What I am really is a driver, you see...

546
00:36:23,128 --> 00:36:26,284
Don't try to come the old soldier with me, lad!

547
00:36:26,549 --> 00:36:27,710
Who, me?

548
00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:32,972
Yes, you! And when we get in the tunnels, don't you try to skive off,

549
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:35,072
'cos if you do I'll have you for breakfast. D'you understand?

550
00:36:36,054 --> 00:36:36,952
Trolley's ready, Staff.

551
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:37,963
Right, come on!

552
00:36:48,775 --> 00:36:51,381
So far, so good. If we don't see any Yeti,

553
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,521
we should make Covent Garden in about ten minutes. Come on!

554
00:37:01,517 --> 00:37:02,952
Captain, they've gone

555
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,752
and Evans with them, I think. I can't find him anywhere.

556
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:07,742
Yes, well we'd better question Evans carefully when he gets back.

557
00:37:07,749 --> 00:37:08,518
Aye, if he gets back.

558
00:37:09,222 --> 00:37:12,247
It's a funny business, Doctor, that fungus disappearing.

559
00:37:12,553 --> 00:37:15,325
Yes, yes I know... Don't worry about that just at the moment.

560
00:37:15,353 --> 00:37:17,625
I've been working on this control box with Miss Travers.

561
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:20,025
There's a few more things I need - transistors, circuits...

562
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:20,944
Aren't there any in Stores?

563
00:37:21,143 --> 00:37:22,300
No, not of the right type.

564
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:24,107
Well in that case, Doctor, I can't help you.

565
00:37:24,294 --> 00:37:27,695
Well - I was wondering... if I could go up to street level...

566
00:37:28,126 --> 00:37:29,424
The mist! Or the Yeti!

567
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:31,792
There's no mist directly above us here - we'd have to risk the Yeti.

568
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,591
No. No, I'm afraid that's out.

569
00:37:33,807 --> 00:37:35,665
It's terribly important. Please!

570
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:37,819
It'll only take five minutes.

571
00:37:38,518 --> 00:37:40,526
Alright. I'll get my gear.

572
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:42,206
Well done, Travers!

573
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:47,596
The Colonel will be through there at Covent Garden in a few minutes, right?

574
00:37:48,026 --> 00:37:50,471
Do you think they'll be able to load the police box on here, Staff?

575
00:37:50,783 --> 00:37:53,779
Well, if we can get this thing through the fungus stuff...

576
00:37:53,783 --> 00:37:57,779
...there's not much of a gradient in this section of the tunnel.

577
00:37:57,883 --> 00:38:00,579
Right, I want one volunteer.

578
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,492
Volunteer? That's a dirty word, that is. Not me!

579
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:05,510
Lane?

580
00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:06,613
What for, Staff?

581
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:10,363
Well, if this thing wants some help going through to Covent Garden, I'm going through with it...

582
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:11,421
Into that stuff?

583
00:38:11,614 --> 00:38:12,816
Have we got those respirators?

584
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:14,377
Well yeah, here.

585
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,232
I reckon we should be all right in these.

586
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:27,062
Oh all right, Lane lad. I'll go by meself.

587
00:38:27,935 --> 00:38:30,354
No, 'ang on a sec, Staff.

588
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,954
That trolley's heavy, it'll take two of us to shift it.

589
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,026
Good lad. Come on.

590
00:38:36,324 --> 00:38:37,697
You're potty, the pair of you!

591
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:38,863
Shut up, will you! Do as you're told.

592
00:38:38,927 --> 00:38:40,363
Play that rope out as we go

593
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,763
any sign of trouble whip us out sharpish. Right?

594
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:43,811
Well, it's your neck.

595
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:44,518
OK.

596
00:38:44,743 --> 00:38:45,488
Alright then...

597
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:15,874
Staff? Staff Arnold?...

598
00:39:43,267 --> 00:39:44,269
Look, sir!

599
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:49,014
In Here! Quick!

600
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:54,162
Come on, through the gate!

601
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,677
I'm going to find a way out. Split up!

602
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:21,322
Yetis - three of them, sir!

603
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:22,863
Grenades!

604
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:30,860
Right, fire!

605
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:41,633
Sir, they're smashing down the gate!

606
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,954
We can't hold 'em, sir!

607
00:40:58,517 --> 00:41:00,055
Over the top, all of you!

608
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:27,878
Grenades!

609
00:41:45,487 --> 00:41:47,214
Through the yard, come on!

610
00:41:53,652 --> 00:41:54,629
Right, bazooka here to cover the others.

611
00:42:12,008 --> 00:42:12,961
Dawson! Langley!

612
00:42:31,388 --> 00:42:37,856
Make for the warehouse!... Murphy!

613
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,579
There it is again, Doctor!

614
00:42:58,801 --> 00:42:59,804
Just one more thing.

615
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:05,609
For heaven's sake, hurry up!

616
00:43:05,824 --> 00:43:08,437
I just need one more component. I'll look through here.

617
00:43:23,428 --> 00:43:25,328
Doctor! Doctor, look out!

618
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,554
No! No!

619
00:44:01,075 --> 00:44:02,623
And this was in his pocket, you say?

620
00:44:03,915 --> 00:44:06,246
How did he get it? You said it was stolen.

621
00:44:06,776 --> 00:44:08,360
You can't think that he...

622
00:44:08,595 --> 00:44:12,829
No no no, he didn't steal it. The person who did planted it on him.

623
00:44:13,206 --> 00:44:13,834
Hmm!

624
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:15,869
Eh, don't you try and pin this on me, boyo!

625
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,369
Strikes me, anything goes wrong around here and I'm always the one to get the blame.

626
00:44:19,558 --> 00:44:22,099
Alright, alright, let's keep our temper, shall we?

627
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,299
The point is, two of these were missing. Now where's the other one?

628
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:30,472
There. That one shouldn't bother us any more.

629
00:45:30,544 --> 00:45:32,972
Now then, come along, Anne, let's get down to work.

630
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,482
Where did I put those bits and pieces?

631
00:45:35,493 --> 00:45:38,073
I wish I knew who put it in the Captain's pocket.

632
00:45:38,256 --> 00:45:39,924
Well it must have been Chorley.

633
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:41,003
Well look, he left ages ago.

634
00:45:41,182 --> 00:45:42,413
It doesn't matter. He could still...

635
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,480
Colonel!

636
00:45:43,698 --> 00:45:44,509
Are you alright?

637
00:45:44,892 --> 00:45:45,855
What's happened?

638
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:47,756
Colonel, what happened?

639
00:45:48,825 --> 00:45:49,926
Gone.

640
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:51,610
Not all of them?

641
00:45:52,505 --> 00:45:54,408
All of them?

642
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:57,781
I said so, didn't I? All of them.

643
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,781
Evans, what about your party?

644
00:46:01,327 --> 00:46:02,132
Arnold?

645
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,270
Gone, sir.

646
00:46:04,237 --> 00:46:05,644
Captain Knight, too.

647
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,070
Knight! Hopeless.

648
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:14,859
Can't fight them - it seems...indestructible.

649
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,300
Can't fight them! You were right, Doctor.

650
00:46:17,301 --> 00:46:22,159
when you said they were...formless, shapeless... you were right.

651
00:46:22,841 --> 00:46:26,976
Listen... listen, everyone! It's the other Yeti model!

652
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,176
It's here! It's somewhere in this room!

653
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,055
That noise, I've been hearing it on and off all day...

654
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:31,956
Your pockets!

655
00:46:32,224 --> 00:46:32,710
What?

656
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:36,013
Open your pockets, Colonel! Quickly, quickly, come on!

657
00:46:36,784 --> 00:46:38,228
How... how...

658
00:46:38,403 --> 00:46:39,722
They bring the Yeti!

659
00:46:48,174 --> 00:46:49,202
Oh no!

660
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:50,771
I just don't understand what's happening!

661
00:46:50,979 --> 00:46:51,754
Poor Travers!

662
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,674
Silence!

663
00:46:53,892 --> 00:46:54,598
Father!

664
00:46:54,793 --> 00:46:55,835
- No, no! No!  - But I must..

665
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:58,033
No, Anne! Don't go near him.

666
00:46:58,307 --> 00:47:02,523
I... am... the Intelligence!

667
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,600
- ANNE: No. No   - He can't be.

668
00:47:04,726 --> 00:47:11,704
Listen to me! I speak to you with this man's voice.

669
00:47:11,726 --> 00:47:20,704
because the time has come for you to understand my purpose.

670
00:47:20,744 --> 00:47:21,772
What's he getting at?

671
00:47:21,951 --> 00:47:22,660
Quiet!

672
00:47:22,951 --> 00:47:23,915
What do you want?

673
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:27,565
You defeated me in Tibet, Doctor.

674
00:47:27,822 --> 00:47:28,379
Yes.

675
00:47:28,621 --> 00:47:36,125
Now you have fallen into the trap that I have so carefully prepared for you.

676
00:47:36,196 --> 00:47:37,598
What do you want?

677
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:47,749
You! Your mind will be invaluable to me. Therefore I have invented a machine...

678
00:47:47,872 --> 00:47:55,349
...that will drain all past knowledge and experience from your mind.

679
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:56,916
But you'll kill him!

680
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:05,460
Oh, no. He will survive, his mind unharmed - only empty

681
00:48:05,681 --> 00:48:06,748
You can't - we'll fight!

682
00:48:07,024 --> 00:48:13,349
That will not do. The Doctor must submit willingly.

683
00:48:13,748 --> 00:48:16,855
And if I... if I do submit, what of the others?

684
00:48:17,954 --> 00:48:20,759
Then the others will go free.

685
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:22,850
And my father too?

686
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:31,656
Oh, him too. I'm only using his body to communicate with you.

687
00:48:32,707 --> 00:48:34,391
He didn't help you before, then?

688
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:44,553
Oh, no. I have many other human hands at my command.

689
00:48:44,866 --> 00:48:45,755
And who are they?

690
00:48:47,655 --> 00:48:56,868
Always questioning! Even now, you're seeking to destroy me!

691
00:48:56,955 --> 00:49:02,068
I see I shall have to guide your thoughts.

692
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:06,810
No, Jamie, no!

693
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:15,052
Cooperate and the child will be unharmed.

694
00:49:15,654 --> 00:49:21,052
You have twenty minutes to make up your mind.

695
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:23,058
Let me go, Doctor!

696
00:49:23,282 --> 00:49:25,317
Jamie, don't be a fool! You don't stand a chance.

697
00:49:25,438 --> 00:49:26,424
Let me go! Victoria!

698
00:49:27,774 --> 00:49:28,763
Let me past, Colonel!

699
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:32,473
No. The Doctor's right. There've been enough lives wasted.

700
00:49:36,443 --> 00:49:41,897
Please... my wrist... Professor!

701
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:51,990
Eh! Wait a minute!

702
00:49:52,173 --> 00:49:53,991
What is it, Evans, what's the matter now?

703
00:49:54,177 --> 00:49:55,094
Stand back everyone!

704
00:49:59,407 --> 00:50:00,960
I thought I heard it go!

705
00:50:01,012 --> 00:50:02,104
Yes, well we'd better make sure.

706
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:04,804
Evans - you, myself and McCrimmon will go and search the place.

707
00:50:05,212 --> 00:50:07,804
Doctor, you'd better stay behind here and get on with your tinkering.

708
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:18,900
Professor, please, you're hurting me! My wrist! Professor!

709
00:50:28,976 --> 00:50:35,772
Yes... yes, that should complete the circuit, good... I wonder...

710
00:50:37,395 --> 00:50:38,916
There's only one way to find out.

711
00:50:39,124 --> 00:50:42,153
Yes. Certainly no sound out there.

712
00:50:42,449 --> 00:50:43,878
Shall we chance it, then?

713
00:50:44,081 --> 00:50:45,294
Why not?

714
00:50:47,717 --> 00:50:48,604
Now!

715
00:50:49,135 --> 00:50:50,775
No! Back! No!

716
00:50:51,038 --> 00:50:58,227
Push! Push! Push, hard as you can! Push, get your back to it! Get your back to it!

717
00:50:58,413 --> 00:51:01,658
Fire door - by the stairs - go and unhitch it, and I'll try to hold this. Go on, McCrimmon!

718
00:51:01,845 --> 00:51:02,249
You sure?

719
00:51:02,457 --> 00:51:04,074
Yes, go on! Go on!

720
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,180
Alright, Colonel, come on!

721
00:51:16,596 --> 00:51:18,670
Strange, it's not picking up.

722
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:26,670
The Intelligence must be transmitting... I wonder why it's not working...

723
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,376
Aha! Success! It's going, Anne! Come along.

724
00:51:31,565 --> 00:51:35,422
Oh, oh that's marvellous. I'm sorry I'm being so long - this is such a fiddling job.

725
00:51:35,585 --> 00:51:36,748
Help you in a minute...

726
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,184
There we are. Now then...

727
00:51:40,132 --> 00:51:42,030
Yes, you see, it's homing!

728
00:51:43,485 --> 00:51:44,177
There we are...

729
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:47,822
Do we go on or turn back?

730
00:51:48,043 --> 00:51:49,095
Let's go on.

731
00:51:49,447 --> 00:51:50,420
Right.

732
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:56,165
Come on, what are you waiting for?

733
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:58,660
Hey, wait a minute!

734
00:51:59,552 --> 00:52:02,265
This is Victoria's! We're on the right track!

735
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,096
No, don't shoot!

736
00:52:20,223 --> 00:52:22,361
Is that thing on our side, then?

737
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:23,390
It is now. Stop!

738
00:52:26,669 --> 00:52:28,022
Were you scared?

739
00:52:28,516 --> 00:52:33,497
Eh? Oh no, no, I mean, I just got up here to get a better aim, that's all.

740
00:52:33,516 --> 00:52:35,497
How did you make it stop then?

741
00:52:35,759 --> 00:52:37,608
Simple - I told it to.

742
00:52:45,513 --> 00:52:50,365
Here - ball. Why don't you go back where you come from?

743
00:52:54,128 --> 00:52:55,401
Now, pull the other one.

744
00:52:55,602 --> 00:52:56,928
Oh, show him, Doctor.

745
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:00,919
Alright, I will. Move forward.

746
00:53:02,711 --> 00:53:08,721
Stop... Move to the left... Stop.

747
00:53:09,593 --> 00:53:10,947
There you are, how about that?

748
00:53:11,428 --> 00:53:15,013
Hey, that's great! Make a smashing toy, that would.

749
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,463
Toy? That's a highly complex piece of equipment.

750
00:53:17,629 --> 00:53:20,279
Oh, is it? Well I don't see how it's going to help us.

751
00:53:20,444 --> 00:53:22,155
But it obeys our commands!

752
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:23,000
So?

753
00:53:23,148 --> 00:53:27,502
Well, once we get it inside a Yeti, we'll have a powerful ally!

754
00:53:27,544 --> 00:53:28,686
Inside a Yeti?

755
00:53:28,864 --> 00:53:30,371
Yes, certainly. Will you help us?

756
00:53:30,523 --> 00:53:33,761
You must be joking, Go near one of them things?

757
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:36,561
I may be stupid, but I'm not daft...

758
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,981
Oh very well, Anne, I shall have to do it myself.

759
00:53:39,136 --> 00:53:40,111
Oh, I'm coming with you, Doctor.

760
00:53:40,274 --> 00:53:41,061
No no, it's far too dangerous.

761
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:42,210
There you are, what'd I tell you?

762
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,802
Not another word, I'm coming with you.

763
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:47,400
Hold it.

764
00:53:51,844 --> 00:53:55,512
Staff Arnold? It can't be, we'd given you up for lost!

765
00:53:56,846 --> 00:53:58,102
Easy, easy...

766
00:53:58,417 --> 00:53:59,287
That's it.

767
00:53:59,484 --> 00:54:00,695
Sorry about this, sir.

768
00:54:00,867 --> 00:54:01,704
What happened?

769
00:54:01,886 --> 00:54:07,819
I don't know. Can't remember. I were pushing the trolley through the fungus, and...

770
00:54:07,886 --> 00:54:12,519
and I blacked out. I thought I were... falling.

771
00:54:12,786 --> 00:54:17,819
When I come to, sir, I were in the tunnels...

772
00:54:17,886 --> 00:54:21,019
Where's the Doctor, sir? I met the Professor and the girl back there...

773
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:22,061
Victoria! Is she alright?

774
00:54:22,249 --> 00:54:27,201
Yeti - guarding them, but... I promised I'd tell the Doctor, sir.

775
00:54:27,398 --> 00:54:28,410
Right. Come on, back to HQ.

776
00:54:28,587 --> 00:54:29,530
I'm going for Victoria.

777
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:34,090
Really, we'd stand a better chance if we stick together. Go ahead! Come on, Staff.

778
00:54:34,252 --> 00:54:35,688
Doctor's twenty minutes' almost up.

779
00:54:47,256 --> 00:54:49,750
Evans, come out from behind that board.

780
00:54:53,118 --> 00:54:54,278
Oh, it's you, sir.

781
00:54:54,512 --> 00:54:55,504
Where's the Doctor?

782
00:54:57,106 --> 00:54:58,005
Evans!

783
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,438
B-b-but y-y-y-you...

784
00:54:59,621 --> 00:55:03,057
Stop bleating like a Welsh baa-lamb, Evans, and answer the Colonel.

785
00:55:03,296 --> 00:55:03,793
Sir?

786
00:55:03,943 --> 00:55:05,228
Doctor and Miss Travers, where are they?

787
00:55:05,283 --> 00:55:06,124
Gone, sir.

788
00:55:06,142 --> 00:55:07,087
Gone - where?

789
00:55:07,186 --> 00:55:08,311
Warren Street, I think.

790
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,159
Why?

791
00:55:09,188 --> 00:55:10,741
After a Yeti, they said.

792
00:55:10,768 --> 00:55:11,877
Have a look at the board, sir.

793
00:55:11,983 --> 00:55:13,618
Warren Street.

794
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:15,098
Come on!

795
00:55:15,692 --> 00:55:17,272
No, not you, Staff. Evans, make yourself useful.

796
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,772
Get a dressing for the Staff Sergeant's head.

797
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,529
- Yes, sir.  - Thank you, sir.

798
00:55:23,007 --> 00:55:24,303
We're trapped!

799
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:28,207
Give me the control box, Anne.

800
00:55:28,302 --> 00:55:29,626
- The control box...   - Yes.

801
00:55:29,886 --> 00:55:31,022
Haven't you got it, Doctor?

802
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,739
What! What... hold the sphere!

803
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:35,298
Oh Doctor, you must have it!

804
00:55:35,854 --> 00:55:36,594
Yes...

805
00:55:38,451 --> 00:55:39,774
Doctor!

806
00:55:40,225 --> 00:55:42,190
Don't worry, it'll work!... It's got to work!

807
00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:50,159
I know you said it only worked at short range, but for a moment...

808
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:53,294
Well, don't tell me you were worried?

809
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,300
Would you like to hold this for me? Now then...

810
00:56:07,785 --> 00:56:09,534
It's alright, it's quite safe.

811
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:13,336
Nearly out... there.

812
00:56:14,682 --> 00:56:15,788
Right.

813
00:56:20,325 --> 00:56:23,370
Now then - turn round!

814
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:27,739
Oh, it works! You've done it!

815
00:56:27,955 --> 00:56:32,960
We've done it, you mean! Now then, with my reprogrammed sphere and your control box,

816
00:56:33,055 --> 00:56:36,360
we should be able to work him over quite a distance. And put your arm down!

817
00:56:37,673 --> 00:56:39,744
Now we've got a chance, Anne. Come on!

818
00:56:40,545 --> 00:56:43,227
Oh, mustn't forget him. Come on, Fred, at the double!

819
00:56:46,722 --> 00:56:48,349
Staff! Staff!

820
00:56:48,744 --> 00:56:49,642
What is it?

821
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,319
What is it, Evans?

822
00:56:57,946 --> 00:57:02,280
Come on, Evans lad, get out of it!

823
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,184
What are we going to do now, Staff?

824
00:57:17,315 --> 00:57:20,752
The main door should keep the fungus out of the tunnels for a bit.

825
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,452
We must warn the others that HQ's had it.

826
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:24,171
Right.

827
00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:25,210
Well, come on, then.

828
00:57:25,422 --> 00:57:26,528
Oh, oh no, not me.

829
00:57:26,846 --> 00:57:28,751
You're not disobeying an order, are you, Evans?

830
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,475
Now look here, Staff. If we go up there, and this stuff breaks out, we'll be trapped!

831
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:36,196
Now look, lad, you're scared, that's understandable.

832
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:39,110
But you've been in the Army long enough to know that orders is orders.

833
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:42,910
There's four people up there. If we don't warn them, they're for the chop.

834
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:47,405
So? Four of them's getting the chop - there's no reason to make it six, is there?

835
00:57:47,616 --> 00:57:50,750
I've had enough of your lip for one day. Now come on! Follow me.

836
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,371
Evans! Come back here!

837
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,780
Not on your nelly! Cheerio, Staff!

838
00:57:59,965 --> 00:58:02,698
Right, lad - I'll get you for this!

839
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:09,662
Anne...

840
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:11,732
Hey!

841
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:17,586
Stop! Come back here! ... Stop!

842
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:24,223
Anne, I've been thinking. Until we know who else is working for the Intelligence...

843
00:58:24,316 --> 00:58:26,541
- Everyone must be suspect.  - Yes?

844
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,596
Well, the fewer people who know this chap's on our side, the better.

845
00:58:28,878 --> 00:58:33,441
Yes... yes, and whoever is the Intelligence is bound to know that you're controlling this Yeti.

846
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:35,957
Mmm... I know.

847
00:58:36,314 --> 00:58:44,120
You are to remain here for... Do you think a minute will be enough?

848
00:58:44,364 --> 00:58:44,953
What for?

849
00:58:45,145 --> 00:58:46,051
For us to get clear.

850
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:47,133
Perhaps.

851
00:58:47,373 --> 00:58:52,880
You are to remain here for ninety seconds, and then resume acting on orders from the Intelligence

852
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,200
until you are told otherwise. Is that understood?

853
00:59:00,086 --> 00:59:04,923
Right. Switch off, for ninety seconds, starting from... now.

854
00:59:06,288 --> 00:59:07,197
Come on, Anne.

855
00:59:16,024 --> 00:59:17,218
It is them! Come on!

856
00:59:20,235 --> 00:59:23,793
Am I glad to see you! There's fungus at Warren Street.

857
00:59:23,828 --> 00:59:24,404
Yes, I know.

858
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:26,171
Oh. What are you doing down here, anyway?

859
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,628
Well, as a matter of fact...

860
00:59:27,977 --> 00:59:31,280
I'll tell you another time. Hello, Colonel.

861
00:59:34,357 --> 00:59:37,374
Glad to see you're both safe. Any luck with your gadgets?

862
00:59:37,653 --> 00:59:39,262
No. No, I'm afraid not.

863
00:59:39,552 --> 00:59:40,310
Pity.

864
00:59:40,584 --> 00:59:41,596
Any news of Victoria?

865
00:59:41,848 --> 00:59:43,316
Yes, she's at Piccadilly Station.

866
00:59:43,505 --> 00:59:44,126
Piccadilly?

867
00:59:44,336 --> 00:59:45,138
Is my father there too?

868
00:59:45,362 --> 00:59:46,175
Aye, he's with her.

869
00:59:46,343 --> 00:59:47,006
Are they alright?

870
00:59:47,412 --> 00:59:47,661
Yes.

871
00:59:48,071 --> 00:59:48,947
How do you know?

872
00:59:49,145 --> 00:59:50,561
Ran across Arnold - he saw them.

873
00:59:50,581 --> 00:59:51,337
Arnold?

874
00:59:51,432 --> 00:59:53,950
Arnold! But Evans said - the fungus...

875
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:57,045
Yes, he went into it, alright, but he came out again somehow.

876
00:59:57,156 --> 00:59:58,200
Says he can't remember what happened.

877
00:59:58,453 --> 00:59:59,880
Well we haven't got any time to find out.

878
01:00:00,114 --> 01:00:01,473
No, time's nearly up.

879
01:00:01,885 --> 01:00:03,162
Yes, your twenty minutes.

880
01:00:03,497 --> 01:00:05,142
Well come on, then.

881
01:00:07,415 --> 01:00:08,415
What are you going to do?

882
01:00:08,593 --> 01:00:10,772
We can't do anything until we get back to Headquarters,

883
01:00:10,856 --> 01:00:16,200
and... then, if we've got time, we'll try and increase the range of the control units. Come on!

884
01:00:43,013 --> 01:00:44,041
What is it, Colonel?

885
01:00:44,382 --> 01:00:45,388
Something up ahead.

886
01:00:45,654 --> 01:00:47,152
We can't go back!

887
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,513
What, fungus, you mean?

888
01:00:48,703 --> 01:00:49,198
Yes.

889
01:00:49,409 --> 01:00:50,755
Is that you, Colonel?

890
01:00:51,008 --> 01:00:53,234
It's Arnold. Hang on, Staff!

891
01:00:53,407 --> 01:00:54,816
Why isn't he in HQ?

892
01:00:56,784 --> 01:01:00,107
Sir - the fungus. It's swamped HQ.

893
01:01:00,302 --> 01:01:00,966
No!

894
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:05,138
I'm afraid so, sir. The main doors should keep it out of the tunnels for a bit, but...

895
01:01:05,602 --> 01:01:06,415
Where's Evans?

896
01:01:06,892 --> 01:01:07,791
Scarpered, sir.

897
01:01:18,024 --> 01:01:21,512
Our time's up! We're all together - they've come to fetch us!

898
01:01:49,515 --> 01:01:57,246
H... hello! If you... if you're looking for your friend, he went that way...

899
01:01:59,084 --> 01:02:03,390
Look, you don't want me!... I'm not one of them, see?...

900
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:09,390
Driver, that's what I am... shouldn't be down here at all, really...

901
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:10,819
Hey, steady on!

902
01:02:12,204 --> 01:02:15,293
Oh, going for a walk, are we? There's lovely.

903
01:02:36,964 --> 01:02:38,751
I'm going to make a break for it, sir.

904
01:02:39,431 --> 01:02:42,372
- Think you can?  - Well, it's worth a try.

905
01:02:42,466 --> 01:02:45,268
On the loose, sir, I might be able to do something.

906
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,168
If only you could distract them, sir.

907
01:02:47,725 --> 01:02:48,580
Right, Staff.

908
01:02:53,295 --> 01:02:54,957
I think it wants us to go on, sir.

909
01:02:55,712 --> 01:02:57,335
Right. Here we go.

910
01:03:03,394 --> 01:03:07,645
Wait!... Can't you see, he's fallen over!

911
01:03:08,817 --> 01:03:11,153
Be careful, be careful!

912
01:03:20,134 --> 01:03:22,036
Where are we being taken, Professor?

913
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:23,770
Oh, to meet the Intelligence, I suppose.

914
01:03:30,703 --> 01:03:31,871
A pyramid!

915
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:39,377
Yes - but it's different! We... we've never seen one like this before. It's fascinating!

916
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,877
This must be the machine that the Intelligence intends using on the Doctor.

917
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:46,543
Oh, no no. No, I shouldn't if I was you.

918
01:03:46,763 --> 01:03:48,034
Yes, I think perhaps you're right.

919
01:03:53,103 --> 01:03:55,277
Why didn't you tell me all this before?

920
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:56,591
Him.

921
01:03:56,826 --> 01:03:58,198
You don't think the Colonel...

922
01:03:58,390 --> 01:03:59,366
Well, you never know, do you?

923
01:04:01,752 --> 01:04:03,294
Which one is ours?

924
01:04:03,968 --> 01:04:05,565
I don't know.

925
01:04:05,902 --> 01:04:06,495
What!

926
01:04:06,778 --> 01:04:08,668
Well unfortunately I've lost track of him.

927
01:04:08,977 --> 01:04:10,315
Oh, that's a great help!

928
01:04:10,593 --> 01:04:14,904
Well, never mind, I... I want you to take this microphone

929
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:18,200
... and keep on calling our Yeti to you.

930
01:04:18,702 --> 01:04:20,815
How will I know I've got the right one?

931
01:04:21,183 --> 01:04:24,422
Well, you'll soon know if you haven't got the right one, won't you!

932
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:27,822
Jamie, I hope you don't suffer from claustrophobia!

933
01:04:35,652 --> 01:04:40,391
Sergeant! Oh, oh thank heavens I found you!

934
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,991
I've been wondering down here by myself for... for ages!

935
01:04:44,377 --> 01:04:48,179
Well well well, quite forgotten about you, we had, Mr Chorley!

936
01:04:48,703 --> 01:04:53,406
Tried to get out over the surface, but... there were Yeti everywhere!

937
01:04:53,500 --> 01:05:02,406
And there's this... this fungus, and fog, all around, you see, and... it's hopeless!

938
01:05:07,252 --> 01:05:08,931
Where's the control box?

939
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:10,966
Hm?

940
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:12,893
The control box!

941
01:05:13,544 --> 01:05:14,580
It's in my pocket.

942
01:05:14,989 --> 01:05:19,477
Well, why don't you use it on these Yeti? And then maybe we can escape!

943
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:22,934
Oh, no. I must meet the Intelligence face to face.

944
01:05:23,213 --> 01:05:24,108
Doctor?

945
01:05:24,459 --> 01:05:25,280
What is it?

946
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:29,598
Been thinking - the Yeti haven't noticed McCrimmon's disappearance yet.

947
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,098
Not that I think he'll be able to achieve anything.

948
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:32,161
Go on...

949
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:34,842
Well, I don't really know how to say this, but, um...

950
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:37,920
...there's Miss Travers and Victoria to think of, and, er...

951
01:05:38,147 --> 01:05:40,675
You mean, am I going to give myself up?

952
01:05:41,279 --> 01:05:44,976
Yes. Of course, the decision must be yours, and yours alone.

953
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,176
But the Intelligence did promise to release Travers and Victoria.

954
01:05:48,716 --> 01:05:50,092
You believe that?

955
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,756
Well, why not?

956
01:05:52,215 --> 01:05:54,565
Hello, we've got company.

957
01:05:58,768 --> 01:05:59,950
Hello, sir!

958
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:02,425
Evans, where the devil have you been?

959
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,330
Didn't Staff Arnold tell you, sir?

960
01:06:04,706 --> 01:06:07,375
Yes. Sounded very like desertion to me.

961
01:06:07,647 --> 01:06:11,174
Desertion? Me? Oh, good heavens, no!

962
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:16,974
No, I... I thought I'd try a single-handed and desperate attempt to rescue Professor Travers and the girl!

963
01:06:18,543 --> 01:06:20,442
Isn't Staff Arnold about?

964
01:06:20,778 --> 01:06:21,543
No.

965
01:06:21,792 --> 01:06:22,490
Good!

966
01:06:23,655 --> 01:06:24,881
Listen!

967
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:29,911
Now listen, everyone - when the Yeti come for you, don't struggle.

968
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,311
Whatever you do, don't resist them!

969
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:36,606
Don't struggle, he says! He must be joking!

970
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:39,885
The Doctor will have to give in. There's no other choice!

971
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:43,658
Aye, aye, time to get fell in!

972
01:07:10,388 --> 01:07:12,471
Thank you!

973
01:07:41,551 --> 01:07:45,132
Father! Oh, father, are you alright?

974
01:07:45,339 --> 01:07:46,914
Yes, I'm alright again... Don't, don't worry, Anne.

975
01:07:47,112 --> 01:07:49,630
Jamie and the Doctor - where are they?

976
01:07:51,298 --> 01:07:52,074
Anne?

977
01:07:58,061 --> 01:08:03,948
Come towards me... Like that, that's it... Come to...

978
01:08:09,828 --> 01:08:12,697
Right now. Raise your right arm.

979
01:08:17,287 --> 01:08:19,734
Raise your right arm!

980
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:29,076
Oh, what's the use?

981
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:34,958
Well, there's nothing to be afraid of, dear. Just - just be calm.

982
01:08:37,704 --> 01:08:38,441
Doctor!

983
01:08:38,891 --> 01:08:39,453
The Doctor!

984
01:08:39,672 --> 01:08:40,229
Doctor!

985
01:08:40,627 --> 01:08:41,605
What are they going to do?

986
01:08:41,967 --> 01:08:43,217
Now don't worry, Victoria.

987
01:08:43,426 --> 01:08:44,105
But... I...

988
01:08:44,314 --> 01:08:46,161
Everything's under control. Don't be frightened.

989
01:08:46,478 --> 01:08:47,877
But Doctor, what are they going to do?

990
01:08:48,062 --> 01:08:50,944
Everything is under control. Tell her, Anne, you understand?

991
01:08:50,967 --> 01:08:51,903
Yes... yes, I think so.

992
01:08:52,138 --> 01:08:58,034
Now listen, everyone. Don't do anything foolish! I am perfectly alright.

993
01:08:58,171 --> 01:09:07,173
Yes, he is perfectly alright. Thank you, Doctor, for being so cooperative.

994
01:09:07,413 --> 01:09:10,511
Why don't you show yourself? Who are you?

995
01:09:11,052 --> 01:09:17,018
Silence! You will know soon enough.

996
01:09:18,804 --> 01:09:19,964
Chorley!

997
01:09:20,104 --> 01:09:21,182
- Good grief!   - But that horrible little man...

998
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,785
-  You, the Intelligence?  - No. No.

999
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,521
No no no, he can't be the Intelligence, he can't! It doesn't make sense!

1000
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:28,305
It isn't me! It isn't me, don't you understand!

1001
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:33,150
I'm not the Intelligence! The Intelligence is him!

1002
01:09:34,201 --> 01:09:35,230
It can't be!

1003
01:09:35,937 --> 01:09:38,870
Oh. Arnold

1004
01:09:39,163 --> 01:09:46,315
No. Merely Arnold's lifeless body in which I have concealed myself.

1005
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,215
But let us to work. There will be time for discussion later.

1006
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:53,915
In fact, all the time in the world.

1007
01:09:54,198 --> 01:09:57,635
Oh... so you weren't going to let us go then, afterwards?

1008
01:09:57,667 --> 01:09:59,214
Did you think he would?

1009
01:09:59,384 --> 01:10:02,871
The last member of the party. Come and join us!

1010
01:10:07,014 --> 01:10:08,163
Oh, Jamie!

1011
01:10:08,645 --> 01:10:10,106
Victoria, are you alright?

1012
01:10:10,335 --> 01:10:14,667
Your solicitude is touching. Nevertheless, it is wasting time.

1013
01:10:14,879 --> 01:10:16,895
Frightened that something might go wrong?

1014
01:10:18,613 --> 01:10:19,739
Join the Doctor.

1015
01:10:21,646 --> 01:10:23,191
Do what he says, Jamie.

1016
01:10:29,526 --> 01:10:30,339
Take him!

1017
01:10:30,577 --> 01:10:31,720
Leave him! Leave him be!

1018
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:36,596
I must ensure your complete cooperation, Doctor.

1019
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:40,796
Should you prove at all unhelpful, your young friend's neck will be broken.

1020
01:10:40,994 --> 01:10:46,358
You gave your word that no one would be harmed. I refuse to submit until you release Jamie!

1021
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:48,997
Alright. Release the boy!

1022
01:10:50,132 --> 01:10:52,924
But at the first sign of trouble from you...

1023
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:55,930
Don't worry. I will do what you say.

1024
01:10:56,599 --> 01:11:00,881
Good. Into the machine, Doctor.

1025
01:11:39,861 --> 01:11:43,966
Soon your mind will be absorbed by the Great Intelligence.

1026
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:52,666
You should be very proud, Doctor - your knowledge of the past will help to shape the future of this planet.

1027
01:11:52,968 --> 01:11:54,111
Just get on with it, please.

1028
01:11:54,315 --> 01:11:57,211
You seem very anxious suddenly.

1029
01:11:58,111 --> 01:11:59,745
I just want it over and done with.

1030
01:12:01,849 --> 01:12:05,635
Submission is essential. You must understand, Doctor...

1031
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:11,700
...that without your complete cooperation, this transference would be of no value

1032
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:18,500
Should you offer any opposition, either physical or mental...

1033
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,900
I shall be forced to punish you, or rather your friends.

1034
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,635
Prepare for a great darkness to cloud your mind.

1035
01:12:27,928 --> 01:12:29,111
Attack now! Attack the Yeti!

1036
01:12:29,316 --> 01:12:30,495
Stop it! Stop it!

1037
01:12:32,718 --> 01:12:33,653
Get Arnold!

1038
01:12:33,698 --> 01:12:36,402
No, Jamie, no!

1039
01:12:37,207 --> 01:12:38,356
Come on, get the Doctor out!

1040
01:12:45,811 --> 01:12:49,623
No, you don't understand, you'll ruin everything! No!

1041
01:12:49,672 --> 01:12:51,452
Professor! Anne! Give us some help!

1042
01:12:52,968 --> 01:13:01,090
No! No!... No! Leave me be! You don't understand, I've got to stay here!

1043
01:13:34,273 --> 01:13:36,510
Well, that's that then, innit?

1044
01:13:36,711 --> 01:13:40,387
You blithering Welsh imbecile! Why can't you do what you're told?

1045
01:13:40,793 --> 01:13:41,905
Hey, now just a minute, Doctor!

1046
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:44,455
If we hadn't pulled you out of that, you'd have been a heap of dust by now.

1047
01:13:44,521 --> 01:13:48,173
You're just as bad. I told you to leave it to me! Now you've gone and ruined everything!

1048
01:13:48,395 --> 01:13:50,935
Ruined every - How can we! We... we've won, haven't we?

1049
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:51,630
No!

1050
01:13:51,867 --> 01:13:52,783
What do you mean, Doctor?

1051
01:13:52,952 --> 01:13:59,505
Oh, why didn't they leave it to me? I had crossed those wires on that helmet thing.

1052
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,600
The Intelligence wouldn't have drained me, I had... would have drained the Intelligence!

1053
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,920
As it is, all it got was a crossed circuit!

1054
01:14:06,292 --> 01:14:09,534
You mean, all we've done is... is cut off its contact with Earth,

1055
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:12,334
it's - it's still out there in space somewhere, flying around?

1056
01:14:12,445 --> 01:14:13,580
Precisely! Look!

1057
01:14:17,752 --> 01:14:18,551
Oh!

1058
01:14:18,912 --> 01:14:20,398
Oh, poor fellow!

1059
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,955
Do you mean to say that Arnold wasn't the Intelligence?

1060
01:14:24,032 --> 01:14:29,972
No. He was just a poor soldier that was taken over. He was probably one of the first to disappear.

1061
01:14:30,852 --> 01:14:32,765
You mean it might come back?

1062
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:37,067
Well, it's still around, isn't it? I've failed.

1063
01:14:37,303 --> 01:14:38,467
Nonsense, man!

1064
01:14:38,654 --> 01:14:39,785
You were marvellous.

1065
01:14:39,987 --> 01:14:40,940
Yes. Great victory.

1066
01:14:41,133 --> 01:14:41,887
I doubt it.

1067
01:14:42,081 --> 01:14:45,143
No - you were a hero, and you know it.

1068
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:47,080
You don't really think so. Do you?

1069
01:14:47,235 --> 01:14:48,027
Yes, yes I do.

1070
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:52,451
You've got to face facts, old man. Tomorrow you're going to be a household word, a national figure...

1071
01:14:52,569 --> 01:14:55,214
- Oh no, oh no!
- Yeah! I want you on my television programme, and...

1072
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:57,047
Jamie! Victoria! Come along, it's time we left!

1073
01:14:57,246 --> 01:14:58,175
...but the Press Conference, Doctor!

1074
01:14:59,095 --> 01:14:59,703
Goodbye!

1075
01:14:59,939 --> 01:15:03,327
But Doctor, Doctor, you... you can't go yet, there are a lot of things I want to discuss with you!

1076
01:15:03,496 --> 01:15:04,869
I'm sorry, Travers, we have to go.

1077
01:15:05,068 --> 01:15:06,037
Where are you going?

1078
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:08,650
Covent Garden! Come along. Come along, Jamie.

1079
01:15:08,808 --> 01:15:11,464
Bye!... Bye.

1080
01:15:13,547 --> 01:15:14,536
Where's he going?

1081
01:15:14,787 --> 01:15:17,814
Huh? Oh, er, back to his TARDIS, I suppose.

1082
01:15:17,965 --> 01:15:21,712
You mean this, uh, this time machine thing, it really exists?

1083
01:15:22,328 --> 01:15:27,325
Y... well I, er... oh, explain it to him, Anne, will you?

1084
01:15:27,497 --> 01:15:29,819
Colonel, I think we'd better check up top, don't you?

1085
01:15:29,988 --> 01:15:32,172
Right, Professor. Evans!

1086
01:15:32,502 --> 01:15:33,527
Father - father, I...

1087
01:15:33,633 --> 01:15:39,972
Now don't you go, Miss Travers, I'd er, I'd like you to explain all about this, this time machine for me.

1088
01:15:40,342 --> 01:15:41,629
Oh dear...!

1089
01:15:43,691 --> 01:15:46,347
Where do we go? Which is the way to Covent Garden?

1090
01:15:46,621 --> 01:15:49,312
Oh, don't ask me. I've completely lost my bearings.

1091
01:15:49,604 --> 01:15:51,634
All these tunnels look the same to me.

1092
01:15:51,901 --> 01:15:53,171
Come on, let's try this way.

1093
01:15:53,411 --> 01:15:55,371
Well it doesn't matter, anyway. I mean, there's no danger, is there?

1094
01:15:55,576 --> 01:15:59,283
Well, not from the Yeti, no, but who knows, they might suddenly start the trains again! Come on!

1095
01:15:59,567 --> 01:16:00,104
Trains?
