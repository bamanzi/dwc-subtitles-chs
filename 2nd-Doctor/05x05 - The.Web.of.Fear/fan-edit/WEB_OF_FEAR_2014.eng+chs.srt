OK, Lane, what gives?

Then what?

Well they must have got the ammo unloaded, sir, 'cos he says they were jumped when they were leaving.
他们肯定已经把弹药卸下来了, 头儿．因为他说他们正要离开的时候它们扑过来了

But it... it can't be...

The time machine... it was all true then?
时间机器...这么说都是真的？

204

The TARDIS - I mean aye, of course it's true! Hey, do you know what's happened to the Doctor?
TARDIS - 我是说, 当然是真的！嘿, 你知道博士现在怎么样了？

205
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:25,474
Oh, is he safe?

Isn't he with you?

I can see that, lad... Here!

No sign of that Doctor bloke.

It's obvious, ain't it? It's been got at.

Where's that Doctor? That's what I'd like to know.
那个博士在哪儿？这是我想知道的

222
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,544
Tibet? Tibet? You're joking.
西藏？西藏？你在开玩笑

223
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:54,219
That's where old Travers says they come from. He reckons they're Abominable Snowmen.
是 Travers 说它们就来自那儿. 他管他们叫做可恶的雪人

Come through the post, don't they?
邮递来的, 不是吗？

Nah, seriously. Outer space, that's where they come from. Well that's what I reckon, anyway.
严肃点．外太空, 那是它们来的地方．这是我的猜测

227
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,912
Oh do leave off! You've been reading too many kids' comics, you have!
噢, 得了吧！你看了太多小孩子的漫画书, 对不？

228
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,182
Alright then, Corp, where do they come from?
好吧．下士, 那他们是从那儿来的？

229
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:13,808
It's a foreign power, ain't it? Bacteriological warfare, that's what that stuff is in the tunnels.
应该是外国势力, 对不？细菌战争, 隧道里面的东西就是这个

230
00:18:14,065 --> 00:18:15,175
What, that fungus stuff?
什么, 那些真菌？

231
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:19,448
Yeah. And them Yeti are some sort of new weapon. Well, a sort of robot army.
对, 那些雪怪就是某种新式武器, 一种机器人军队

232
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,093
What, you mean it ain't real then?
什么, 你是说他们不是真的动物？

233
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:23,597
Well of course they ain't, you nit!
当然不是真的, 你个废柴！

234
00:18:23,693 --> 00:18:25,997
Otherwise we'd be able to knock 'em out with the small arms, wouldn't we?
否则我们就可以用小型武器搞定他们了, 对不？

235
00:18:26,193 --> 00:18:27,897
Yeah - nothing hardly touches 'em, does it?
是啊 - 没什么能搞定它们了, 有吗？

236
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:30,497
Not unless you can cop 'em straight between the eyes. Then they've had it.
除非你直接对准它们两眼之间下手, 那它们就嗝屁了

237
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:32,969
Father?
父亲？

238
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:33,704
Hmm?

239
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:36,433
Have you ever seen this TARDIS?
你见过 TARDIS 吗？

240
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:39,493
No, no, I can't say I have.
没, 没有, 我说不上见过

241
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:42,034
It all sounds a bit far-fetched to me.
在我听来感觉有点太不现实了

242
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:45,074
You know, I think the Doctor's at the back of all this.
你知道吗, 我觉得这一切都是博士在背后捣鬼

243
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,270
What do you mean?
你什么意思？

244
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:50,815
Doesn't it strike you as odd that on the two occasions you've encountered the Yeti, you've also come across the Doctor?
你就从来没有觉得奇怪, 你两次遇到雪怪, 你都碰到了博士？

245
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:51,981
Well?
怎样？

246
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,278
Well, it's obvious - he controls them!
这, 很显然 - 他在控制他们！

247
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,812
Oh, but surely...
哦, 但当然...

248
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:59,188
What? Oh, tea. Thank you, my dear.

Oh, aren't you having any?
哦, 你不喝点吗？

250
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,792
No, I think I'll go and lie down for a bit.
不了, 我想我要去躺一会儿

251
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:06,215
Good idea.
好主意

252
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,187
Do you think she heard?
你觉得她听到了吗？

253
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:14,428
No... in any case, what you say is nonsense, Anne.
不管怎么说, 你说的都是胡扯, Anne

254
00:19:14,593 --> 00:19:19,728
I saw the Doctor defeat those robots and save Detsen Monastery.
我看见博士打败了那些机器人, 拯救了德赞寺

255
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:22,828
He wouldn't do that if he was in league with them, now would he?
如果他跟它们是一伙的, 他不会那么做的, 现在他会吗？

256
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,213
No, no I suppose not.
不, 我觉得不会

257
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:29,079
Here, Corp, look at this!
过来, 下士, 看看这个

258
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:37,049
What... oh crikey! That's what comes of talking about it!
什么...啊呀！真是说什么来什么

259
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:39,187
It's that fungus stuff, it's moving again!
是那些真菌, 它又在移动了！

260
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:45,660
Don't worry!
别担心

261
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:49,470
Can't help it - I feel... responsible somehow.
忍不住啊 - 不知怎的...我觉得我有责任

262
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:53,470
If only the Doctor would turn up. I'm sure he could help us.
如果博士能出现就好了, 我肯定他能帮上我们

263
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,663

抱歉, 先生

264
00:19:55,858 --> 00:19:56,613
Eh, what?

That fungus stuff, it's on the move again. Euston Square's gone.
那些真菌, 又在移动了．尤斯顿广场没了

266
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:01,131
Come on, let's have a look!
快来, 我们来看看！

267
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,093
It's on the move again, Weams?
它又在移动了, Weams？

268
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:09,905
Yes, sir. Kings Cross has gone, and it's moving on to Farringdon.
是的, 先生, 国王十字车站也丢了．它现在往 Farringdon 站去了

269

It's never moved as fast as this before!
它以前从来没有移动得这么快过！

Hasn't moved at all the last three weeks, Miss.

Can't say.
不好说

00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:20,647
Strange, isn't it, that all this should happen on the very day that your mysterious Doctor friend turns up?
很奇怪啊，是不是，你的那位博士朋友出现的同一天，就发生了这么多事

274
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:22,038
He hasn't turned up.
他还没出现呢

275
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:25,745
Precisely. He could have sent those kids in here as spies.
的确．他可能是把那两个孩子派过来做间谍了

276
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,820
Rubbish! Would Jamie go away and leave Victoria, if he didn't intend coming back again?
胡说！你说 Jamie 不会再回来, 那他会留下 Victoria 一个人吗？

277
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,584
Excuse me, sir, but where is the young lady?
对不起, 先生, 但那个年轻女士在哪儿？

Oh, in the Common Room, I suppose.
哦, 在公共休息室, 我估计

What? Well... where is she then?
什么？那...她在哪儿呢？

281

Jamie? Doctor?... Jamie? Doctor?

282
00:20:57,892 --> 00:20:58,630

Oh, Doctor, thank goodness I found you! Are you alright?
哦, 博士, 感谢上帝我找到你了！你没事吧

Look, sir, the fungus! It's moving again!
看, 头儿, 真菌！又在移动了！

期望队长和 Staff Arnold 不在那个小东西的附近

Come on, back!

我们没法顶住他们, 头儿．他们来了, 有两个！

O'Brien 和 Cocksey 已经落入它们手上了, 没什么能挡住它们！

What's the plan then?

我从 Holborn 那里带下来一包炸药．我打算引爆它, 炸了它们

Taking a bit of a risk, aren't you, sir?

Looks like the cobwebs!

Get back!

Steady, lad. We'll know soon enough.
稳住, 小伙子。我们很快就会知道

We can't just stand here. Can't we make a run for it?
我们不能就这么站在这儿，我们要不跑过去吧？

We wouldn't stand a chance, not with them switched on.

没事的, 头儿。教授为他担保了。你要知道他对这些机器人很了解

What made them do that, I wonder?
谁让它们这样的，真奇怪

Couldn't say, sir. But I don't think we should stay to find out.
不好说，头儿。但我觉得我们不要停在这里研究这个

Wait - can we not just see what they're up to?
等等 -- 我们能不能看看他们在干什么？

320

Well, there's a sight for sore eyes!

00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:15,142
Are you stark raving mad?
你疯了吗？

327
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:17,401
Aye, well I always sing when I'm scared, see.
啊，我害怕的时候就总唱歌, 就这样。

328
00:25:17,612 --> 00:25:19,268
Stand to attention when you're talking to an officer!

Trying to get out, Sarge!
在找路出去, 中士!

Don't try to be funny with me, lad! How did you get down here in the first place?
别想跟我开玩笑, 小伙子！你一开始是怎么来这里的？

Driver on the ammo truck to Holborn. Got jumped, we did - quite a dust up, there was.
我是开运弹药卡车的司机．我们被袭击了, 真的 - 一片狼藉

我当然确定，长官。听起来有点傻，我知道

342
00:25:56,948 --> 00:26:00,851
but it seemed to be following a Yeti that had a kind of pointed glass thing in its hands.
但它似乎是跟一个雪怪在移动, 雪怪手里有一种玻璃状的尖头器件

343
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:02,068
Was it shaped like a pyramid?

Well, I suppose it was, really.

371

What's happened to Chorley, then?
Chorley 怎么啦？

378
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:47,495
That's what I'm wondering. Did he reach the TARDIS before the fungus, or... or did he not?
这也是我好奇的地方．他是在大网之前到达了 TARDIS 吗？或者他没有？

379
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:50,452
You mean to say, he could have got to the TARDIS and already have taken off in it?
你的意思是说, 他可能已经到达了 TARDIS, 并且已经把它开走了？

00:28:58,855 --> 00:29:01,176
Come on, Jamie, I'll just show this bit of fungus to Travers.
快来, Jamie, 我要把这点真菌展示给 Travers

407
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:01,992
Right.
好嘞

408
00:29:06,729 --> 00:29:08,683
Hey, look at this!
嘿, 看看这个

409
00:29:09,094 --> 00:29:11,574
Good Lord! That's Yeti!
上帝！那是雪怪干的！

410
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:13,791
You don't think they may still be here?
你觉得它们已经不在这里了？

411
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:14,717
I hope not!
我期望不在了！

412
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:16,028
Oh, Doctor!
噢, 博士！

413
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,632
D'you reckon they have?
你觉得他们已经得手了吗？

414
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:25,783
Have what?
得手什么？

415
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:27,535
Taken him? Like she said?
抓走 Travers？正如她所说的？

416
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,563
Yes, I'm very much afraid they have.
是的，恐怕它们真的已经得手了

417
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:35,563
But why? Why didn't they just kill him? Unless...
不过为什么？它们为什么不直接杀了他？除非...

418
00:29:35,812 --> 00:29:36,695
Yes?
什么？

419
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:38,898
Well, unless they had a use for him.
除非它们拿他另有用途

420
00:29:40,658 --> 00:29:42,758
Ah, Doctor. What's this I hear about Travers?
啊, 博士, 我听说 Travers 怎么了？

421
00:29:50,106 --> 00:29:52,090
'Scuse me, sir, but I think you ought to come to the Ops Room.
对不起, 先生, 但恐怕你得到操作室来一趟

422
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:53,219
Why? What's happening?
为什么？怎么了？

423
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,231
That fungus stuff, it's on the move again!
那些真菌网, 又在移动了！

424
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:08,744
It's like a spider's web, ain't it?
看起来像是蜘蛛网, 是不？

425
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:13,454
Yes. And we're the flies, alright, but... where is the spider?
是的, 而我们就是苍蝇．好吧, 不过...蜘蛛在哪儿？

426
00:30:13,876 --> 00:30:15,614
Better give the others a hand, Corporal.
最好给其他人帮一下, 下士

427
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:16,429
Sir.
是！

428
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:20,890
Doctor. Been thinking about what you were saying earlier,
博士, 我在想你之前说的话

429
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:24,690
about someone here in HQ being responsible for all this.
你说总部的某个人得为这些情况负责

430
00:30:24,751 --> 00:30:25,690
Could it have been Travers?
有可能是 Travers 吗？

431
00:30:26,184 --> 00:30:27,024
I doubt it.
我表示怀疑

432
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:29,716
Well, after all he has disappeared.
但是, 不管怎么说他已经消失了

433
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:34,815
Yes - so has Chorley. I'd say he was a much more likely suspect.
是的, Chorley 也消失了．要我说他更像有嫌疑

434
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:35,877
True.
的确

435
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,071
On the other hand, of course, whoever is in league with the Intelligence 
另一方面来看, 当然，不管谁是大智慧的同盟

436
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,471
could still be amongst us here.
他都有可能还在我们中间

437
00:30:42,782 --> 00:30:45,822
That's a fact of which I am uncomfortably aware.
我也意识到了这个事实, 这一点让我很不安

438
00:30:45,882 --> 00:30:49,822
But tell me, Doctor, this Intelligence - exactly what is it?
不过跟我说说, 博士, 这个大智慧到底是个什么东西

439
00:30:50,404 --> 00:30:53,617
Well I wish I could give you a precise answer.
嗯, 我期望我能够给你一个确切的答案

440
00:30:53,704 --> 00:30:58,617
Perhaps the best way to describe it is a sort of formless, shapeless thing
也许最好的描述是, 它是一种无形无体的东西

441
00:30:58,704 --> 00:31:04,917
floating about in space like a cloud of mist, only... with a mind and will.
像一团云雾一样漂浮在太空中, 只有意识和意志

442
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:06,810
What's it after? What's it want?
它在追求什么？它想要什么？

443
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:11,352
I wish I knew. The only thing I know for sure is that it brought me here.
我期望我知道．我唯一确切知道的就是, 它把我带到这里了

444
00:31:11,854 --> 00:31:13,074
Brought you here?
把你带到这里？

445
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:15,438
Yes, been wondering how you got here.
是．我也好奇你是怎么到这里的

446
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:20,471
Yes, well I... I don't think there's any harm in telling you now. I...
这个...我觉得现在告诉你们也没有什么问题, 我...

447
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:23,971
I have a craft, that travels in time and space.
我有一艘飞船, 可以穿越时间和空间

448
00:31:25,023 --> 00:31:27,253
Oh, come now Doctor, you can't expect me to...
噢, 得了博士, 你不会指望我会...

449
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:32,134
This craft of yours, this time-space craft. Could it get us out of here?
你的这个飞船, 时空飞船, 它能把我们带出这里吗？

450
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,418
Well, yes - but it's at Covent Garden!
嗯, 可以 - 但它现在在科文特花园

451
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:37,006
What does it look like?
它是什么样子的？

452
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:39,345
It's a police box.
是个警察亭

453
00:31:39,612 --> 00:31:41,464
Oh really, Colonel, surely you're not...
噢, 真的吗, 上校, 你不会...

454
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:45,012
So - if we could rescue that craft, you could take us out?
这么说, 如果我们能弄回那个飞船, 你就能把我们带出去？

455
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,018
Yes, yes I could, but I have to stay here and finish Travers' work!
是的, 我可以．但我现在必须呆在这里, 完成 Travers 的工作

456
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:54,409
Ah, Doctor. Miss Travers is feeling alright now, and would like to see you right away.
啊, 博士, Travers 小姐现在感觉没事了, 现在想马上见你

457
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:57,184
Very good, Jamie. Excuse me, gentlemen, please.
很好, Jamie．请原谅, 先生们

458
00:31:57,453 --> 00:31:57,967
Yes.
好的

459
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:02,095
Well, I've heard some stories in my time, but that one really takes...
哈, 我这辈子听过不少故事, 那个故事还真是...

460
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:03,193
So you don't believe him?
看来你不相信他？

461
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:07,269
No, of course not, sir! The whole idea is screwy. A police box!
不, 当然不, 头儿！整个故事都很怪诞, 警察亭！

462
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:11,024
Well whether you think it foolish or not, we are going to rescue that craft.
好了, 不管你觉得它是不是傻, 我们都要去找那艘飞船

463
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,837
Oh, but sir! Our job...
噢, 但是头儿！我们的任务...

464
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:15,433
Captain Knight. The Army has failed to defeat this menace.
Knight 队长, 在消除这个威胁上面, 军队已经失败了

465
00:32:15,526 --> 00:32:18,833
Now the Doctor thinks he might succeed. Personally, I doubt it.
现在博士觉得他可能成功．个人来说，我也表示怀疑

466
00:32:18,926 --> 00:32:20,633
But if we stay here, we're as good as dead.
但如果我们待在这里, 我们还是死翘翘

467
00:32:20,726 --> 00:32:23,633
Therefore I do not intend leaving any escape route unexplored,
所以不可能还有一条路而我不去尝试

468
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,633
however... screwy you may think it.
不管这条路你觉得如何怪诞

469
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:26,774
Oh, surely Colonel...
噢, 好吧上校

470
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:28,411
Let's get on with it, shall we, Knight?
我们开动吧, 行不, Knight？

471
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:29,432
Sir.
是！

472
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:36,914
But... but there must be a chance! If the Doctor says...
但是...肯定还有可能的！如果博士说...

473
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:42,254
No, the soldiers could comb these tunnels for a fortnight and still never find him.
不, 士兵们在隧道里来回排查两周, 也不一定能找到他

474
00:32:42,358 --> 00:32:45,554
I'm afraid your father's been taken by the Intelligence.
我担心你的父亲已经被大智慧给抓走了

475
00:32:45,658 --> 00:32:51,054
The only way that we can save him is by finding the central control source.
我们能救他的唯一途径是找到中心控制源

476
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:53,046
Aye, if it's anywhere, that's where he'll be.
是, 那东西在什么地方, 他就在什么地方

477
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:57,180
But why? Why him? Why not me, or one of the soldiers, or...
但是为什么？为什么是他, 而不是我, 也不是其他哪个士兵, 抑或...

478
00:32:57,357 --> 00:33:04,321
Yes, I know. Tell me, what was your father working on
是的, 我知道．告诉我, 你父亲之前在研究什么？

479
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,121
just before the Yeti broke in, Anne?
就在雪怪闯入之前, Anne?

480
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:11,360
Um... oh, we were ready to test the sphere with the control unit,
嗯...哦, 我们已经准备好要用控制器来测试球体了

481
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,960
but I don't see what this has to do with anything, Doctor.
但我看不出来这跟这些有什么关系, 博士

482
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:17,721
But don't you? If he was near to success...
看不出吗？如果他快要成功了...

483
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:19,006
That's why they took him!
那就是它们抓走他的原因

484
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,665
Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?
对，这是有可能的，是不？

485
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,565
Now Anne, do you feel strong enough to come back to the laboratory?
现在，Anne，你觉得你恢复得怎样了，可以回到实验室吗？

486
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:24,779
Yes, yes of course.
可以，当然可以

487
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:25,732
Anything we can do?
我们能做点什么？

488
00:33:25,906 --> 00:33:26,883
No, no, you just take it easy, Jamie.
不，不用，你就休息一下吧，Jamie

489
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:31,037
What's the matter?
怎么了？

490
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:33,361
I've been thinking about what the Doctor said.
我在想博士所说的是

491
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:36,561
Anything we do, the Intelligence always knows!
不管我们做什么，大智慧总是知道！

492
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:40,379
Aye, but I wouldn't let it worry you. The Doctor will soon find a way out.
是，不过我不会让这个事烦你。博士很快会找到解决办法的

493
00:33:40,828 --> 00:33:42,321
I wish I could believe that.
真期望我能相信那个

494
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:48,926
Oh yes. Yes, this seems to be in order, Anne.
哦是的，是的，这似乎是正常的，Anne

495
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:55,289
My father didn't want it put together until this was in proper order.
我父亲不想在一切就绪之前不想把组合拼起来

496
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,144
Very wise. Let's have a look at this...
很明智。我们来看看这个

497
00:33:58,261 --> 00:34:03,225
Oh yes, yes... My word, this is a splendid piece of work, Anne.
啊是，是的...我得说，这是一件了不起的作品，Anne

498
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:03,934
Thank you.
谢谢你

499
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,307
Yes, this should control the sphere, alright.
是的，这可以操纵球体，很好

500
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:09,207
But would it override the commands issued by the Intelligence, I wonder?
但它能否压制大智慧发出的命令呢，我想知道

501
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:12,840
No. No, I'm afraid it won't. I just didn't have the time. Do you think we can do it.
不，恐怕不能。我还没有时间来弄。你觉得我们可以搞定吗？

502
00:34:13,028 --> 00:34:15,329
Oh, we can do it, if you've got the right bits and pieces.
哦，我们可以搞。只要你有正确的零配件

503
00:34:16,022 --> 00:34:18,997
Hope I'm not disturbing, Doctor, but Staff asked me to give you this.
期望我没打扰你，博士。不过 Staff 让我把这个交给你

504
00:34:20,632 --> 00:34:21,750
Where'd you get this?
你从哪儿得到这个的？

505
00:34:21,985 --> 00:34:24,211
On the floor, by that young lad Weams, it was.
地上, Weams 那个年轻小伙子捡到的

506
00:34:24,788 --> 00:34:27,578
But this is what brought the Yeti to the explosives store!
但就是这个东西把雪怪引到炸药储藏室的

507
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:31,578
It's obviously been reprogrammed as a homing device, and you've given it to me!
很显然它被改成了一个发出归巢信号的装置, 而你居然把它给了我！

508
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,149
Here! You don't think I had anything to do with these Yeti, do you?
嘿, 你不是认为我跟这些雪怪有什么关系吧, 是吗？

509
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,675
Doctor! The other models - they've gone!
博士！其它的模型呢, 不见了！

510
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:44,404
Well don't look at me! I didn't want to come down here in the first place
别看我啊！我一开始就不想下到这里来

511
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:47,804
I shouldn't be down here at all, really. Driver, I am, see.
我根本就完全不该到这里来, 真的, 我只是个司机, 对不

512
00:34:47,872 --> 00:34:50,304
You'd better have this, before you say I've nicked it.
你最好拿走这个, 免得你又说我藏匿了它

513
00:34:50,694 --> 00:34:51,533
Thank you.
谢谢你

514
00:34:51,795 --> 00:34:53,753
And I'll have the tin back, when you've finished with it.
而且等你用完了, 我还要把铁盒拿回来的

515
00:34:54,378 --> 00:34:58,034
Don't look so unhappy - we're all under suspicion, you know, including me.
别那么不高兴 - 我们所有人都有嫌疑, 你知道的, 包括我

516
00:34:58,275 --> 00:34:58,948
Hmm!
哼！

517
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:01,373
What's in the tin, Doctor?
铁盒里面有什么, 博士？

518
00:35:01,777 --> 00:35:05,907
It's the fungus from the tunnel. I thought if we examined it, it might give us a clue.
是在隧道里面采集的真菌, 我想如果我们研究一下它的话, 也许会有点线索

519
00:35:05,977 --> 00:35:10,007
I must get this dismantled. It's like holding a time bomb.
我得把这个破解掉, 感觉像拿着一颗定时炸弹似的

520
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:16,962
So my party will get above ground and approach Covent Garden by Neal Street. Is that clear?
我的人会到地面上去, 从尼尔街往科文特花园站靠拢, 清楚了吗？

521
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,586
Now Staff here will be taking the trolley through the tunnel,
Staff 现在就把推车从这里弄到隧道里面去

522
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,586
and will arrive, we hope, at the same time as we do. You picked your two men, Staff?
期望跟我们同时到达目标．你选两个你的人带上, Staff？

523
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,259
Yes, sir. Lane and Evans.
是, 头儿, 就 Lane 和 Evans 吧

524
00:35:25,772 --> 00:35:29,099
Right. Now as soon as we get there, we shall be looking for a police box.
好．等我们一到那里, 就开始寻找一个警察亭

525
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:30,432
A police box, sir?
一个警察亭吗, 头儿？

526
00:35:30,594 --> 00:35:32,536
Yes, a police box. Now I want that box either out of the station
是的, 一个警察亭．现在我想要的是尽快将它弄出站去

527
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,036
and onto the trolley as quickly as possible. Is that understood?
然后弄到推车上, 清楚了吗？

528
00:35:35,114 --> 00:35:35,670
Yes, sir.
是, 长官

529
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:36,572
Right. Any questions?
好, 还有问题吗？

530
00:35:36,747 --> 00:35:39,075
Yes, sir, this, um... police box. Is it important?
有, 长官．这个...警察亭, 它重要吗？

531
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:42,410
Corporal Blake, we'd hardly be going to this trouble if it weren't.
Blake 下士, 如果它不重要，我们就不用费这个事了

532
00:35:43,158 --> 00:35:45,017
Who's going to look after the civilians, sir?
谁来照看这几个平民, 长官？

533
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:47,813
I'd like you to stay behind and look after them, Captain Knight.
我期望你留下来照看他们, Knight 队长

534
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:51,513
The Doctor's got work to do. Right gentlemen, time to go.
博士还有工作要完成．好了先生们, 该行动了

535
00:35:51,657 --> 00:35:52,935
- Ah, Doctor.   - Oh Jamie, what is it?
- 啊，博士   - 哦，Jamie，什么事

536
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:54,395
The Colonel says to tell you he's on his way.

546
00:36:19,023 --> 00:36:20,912

I've been working on this control box with Miss Travers.

The mist! Or the Yeti!

在我们的正上方没有雾瘴，雪怪的险我们得冒

What for, Staff?
做什么, Staff?

这样, 如果这个东西需要点帮助才能穿过去到达科文特花园, 我就得自己来...

What is it?
什么事？

823
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,319
What is it, Evans?
什么事, Evans？

824
00:56:57,946 --> 00:57:02,280
Come on, Evans lad, get out of it!
快来，Evans，离开这儿！

825
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,184
What are we going to do now, Staff?
我们现在打算做什么，Staff？

826
00:57:17,315 --> 00:57:20,752
The main door should keep the fungus out of the tunnels for a bit.
这道门应该能把真菌网挡住一阵

827
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,452
We must warn the others that HQ's had it.
我们必须警告其他人总部已经沦陷了

828
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:24,171
Right.
是

00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:25,210
Well, come on, then.
那就快来

830
00:57:25,422 --> 00:57:26,528
Oh, oh no, not me.
噢，不，不要找我

831
00:57:26,846 --> 00:57:28,751
You're not disobeying an order, are you, Evans?
你不服从命令是吗，Evans？

832
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,475
Now look here, Staff. If we go up there, and this stuff breaks out, we'll be trapped!
现在你看，Staff。如果我们上去，而这个东西扩散了，我们就被困住了

833
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:36,196
Now look, lad, you're scared, that's understandable.
听着小子，你害怕，这是可以理解德

834
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:39,110
But you've been in the Army long enough to know that orders is orders.
但你在军队待得够久了，该知道命令就是命令

835
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:42,910
There's four people up there. If we don't warn them, they're for the chop.
上面有四个人，如果我们不警告他们，他们就任凭宰割了

836
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:47,405
So? Four of them's getting the chop - there's no reason to make it six, is there?
所以啊，他们四个被宰割，没理由要变成六个啊，对不？

837
00:57:47,616 --> 00:57:50,750
I've had enough of your lip for one day. Now come on! Follow me.
今天一天我算是受够你那张破嘴了。现在快点，跟着我

838
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,371
Evans! Come back here!
Evans！回来这边！

839
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,780
Not on your nelly! Cheerio, Staff!
不跟你一起了！祝你好运，Staff！

840
00:57:59,965 --> 00:58:02,698
Right, lad - I'll get you for this!
好，小子，我会找你算账的！

841
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:09,662
Anne...

842
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:11,732
Hey!
嘿！

843
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:17,586
Stop! Come back here! ... Stop!
停下！回来这里！... 停下！

844
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:24,223
Anne, I've been thinking. Until we know who else is working for the Intelligence...
Anne，我一直在想。在我们确切知道还有谁在为大智慧工作以前...

845
00:58:24,316 --> 00:58:26,541
- Everyone must be suspect.  - Yes?
- 每个人都是有嫌疑的   - 嗯?

846
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,596
Well, the fewer people who know this chap's on our side, the better.
知道这个家伙在我们这边的人，越少越好

847
00:58:28,878 --> 00:58:33,441
Yes... yes, and whoever is the Intelligence is bound to know that you're controlling this Yeti.
是的，不管谁是大智慧，他肯定知道是你在控制这个雪怪

848
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:35,957
Mmm... I know.
嗯... 我知道

849
00:58:36,314 --> 00:58:44,120
You are to remain here for... Do you think a minute will be enough?

850
00:58:44,364 --> 00:58:44,953
What for?
够干什么？

851
00:58:45,145 --> 00:58:46,051
For us to get clear.
够我们俩闪人

852
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:47,133
Perhaps.
也许吧

853
00:58:47,373 --> 00:58:52,880
You are to remain here for ninety seconds, and then resume acting on orders from the Intelligence

854
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,200
until you are told otherwise. Is that understood?
直到你得到其它指示，明白了吗

00:59:00,086 --> 00:59:04,923
Right. Switch off, for ninety seconds, starting from... now.

It is them! Come on!

Oh. What are you doing down here, anyway?

I'll tell you another time. Hello, Colonel.

Ran across Arnold - he saw them.

Arnold! But Evans said - the fungus...
Arnold！但 Evans 说过，那些真菌....

Says he can't remember what happened.

Well we haven't got any time to find out.

Why isn't he in HQ?

Sir - the fungus. It's swamped HQ.

No!

896
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:05,138
I'm afraid so, sir. The main doors should keep it out of the tunnels for a bit, but...
恐怕如此。大门还能把它挡在隧道外面，但是...

897
01:01:05,602 --> 01:01:06,415

Scarpered, sir.

你...你好！如果你们...你们在找你们的朋友，他去那边了...

我说，你不会想要我的！... 我不是他们中的一员，明白？

Driver, that's what I am... shouldn't be down here at all, really...

Hey, steady on!

On the loose, sir, I might be able to do something.

908
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,168
 If only you could distract them, sir.

909
01:02:47,725 --> 01:02:48,580

I think it wants us to go on, sir.
我觉得它想要我们继续走，头儿

911
01:02:55,712 --> 01:02:57,335
Right. Here we go.

Where are we being taken, Professor?

Oh, to meet the Intelligence, I suppose.

A pyramid!
一座金字塔！

917
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:39,377
Yes - but it's different! We... we've never seen one like this before. It's fascinating!
是的，但有些不一样，我们...之前从没见过这个样子的。很有意思！

918
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,877
This must be the machine that the Intelligence intends using on the Doctor.
这肯定就是大智慧说要用在博士身上的那个机器

919
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:46,543
Oh, no no. No, I shouldn't if I was you.

Yes, I think perhaps you're right.

Him.

You don't think the Colonel...

Well unfortunately I've lost track of him.

Oh, that's a great help!

... and keep on calling our Yeti to you.

How will I know I've got the right one?
我怎么知道过来的是对的？

933
01:04:21,183 --> 01:04:24,422
Well, you'll soon know if you haven't got the right one, won't you!
哦，如果不对的话，你很快就会知道，是吧？

934
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:27,822
Jamie, I hope you don't suffer from claustrophobia!
Jamie，我期望你没有幽闭恐怖症

935
01:04:35,652 --> 01:04:40,391
Sergeant! Oh, oh thank heavens I found you!

我一个人在这下面转悠了...好几个世纪了！

Well well well, quite forgotten about you, we had, Mr Chorley!
喔喔喔，我们都快忘记你了，Chorley 先生

938
01:04:48,703 --> 01:04:53,406
Tried to get out over the surface, but... there were Yeti everywhere!
试过逃到地面上去，但是...到处都有雪怪！

939
01:04:53,500 --> 01:05:02,406
And there's this... this fungus, and fog, all around, you see, and... it's hopeless!
而这里有这个...真菌网，雾瘴，到处都是，你看，还有... 让人绝望

940
01:05:07,252 --> 01:05:08,931
Where's the control box?
控制盒在哪儿？

941
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:10,966
Hm?

942

The control box!

943
01:05:13,544 --> 01:05:14,580
It's in my pocket.
在我口袋里

944
01:05:14,989 --> 01:05:19,477
Well, why don't you use it on these Yeti? And then maybe we can escape!
怎么，你怎么不对这些雪怪使用？那样的话也许我们能逃出去

945
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:22,934
Oh, no. I must meet the Intelligence face to face.
哦，不。我必须跟大智慧面对面

946

Doctor?

01:05:24,459 --> 01:05:25,280
What is it?
什么事？

948
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:29,598
Been thinking - the Yeti haven't noticed McCrimmon's disappearance yet.
我在想，雪怪还没有留意到 McCrimmon 已经不见了

949
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,098
Not that I think he'll be able to achieve anything.
倒不是说我觉得他能搞定什么

950
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:32,161
Go on...
继续...

951
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:34,842
Well, I don't really know how to say this, but, um... 
这个...我真不知道该怎么说，但是...

You mean, am I going to give myself up?

954
01:05:41,279 --> 01:05:44,976
Yes. Of course, the decision must be yours, and yours alone.
是的。当然，决定是你自己做，独自做

955
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,176
But the Intelligence did promise to release Travers and Victoria.
但大智慧的确承诺过会放了 Travers 和 Victoria

956
01:05:48,716 --> 01:05:50,092
You believe that?
你相信吗？

957
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,756
Well, why not?
为什么不？

958

Hello, we've got company.

Evans, where the devil have you been?
Evans，见鬼你去哪儿了？

961
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,330
Didn't Staff Arnold tell you, sir?
Staff Arnold 没有告诉你吗，长官？

962
01:06:04,706 --> 01:06:07,375
Yes. Sounded very like desertion to me.

不不！... 不！别管我！你们没明白，我必须待在这里！

Well, that's that then, innit?
啊，那就是那个东西，是吧？

你个爱叨叨的威尔士草包！为什么不能跟你说什么就做什么呢？

Hey, now just a minute, Doctor!
嗨，等一下，博士！

如果我们没把你从那里面拉出来，你现在已经是一堆黄土了

你就好了？我告诉过你别管我！现在你破坏了一切！

01:13:51,867 --> 01:13:52,783
What do you mean, Doctor?
你什么意思，博士

噢，为什么他们就不能别管我呢？我已经反转了那个头盔里面的项圈

1054

Oh, poor fellow!

Do you mean to say that Arnold wasn't the Intelligence?
你的意思是说 Arnold 不是大智慧？

You don't really think so. Do you?
