1
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:26,312
All right, Corporal. Nip back and tell Captain Knight it's all clear up 'ere. And get 'em to get a shift on!

2
00:27:26,523 --> 00:27:27,646
Righto, Staff.

3
00:27:30,436 --> 00:27:32,249
This looks familiar - it's around this corner.

4
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:33,922
Oh no!

5
00:27:34,443 --> 00:27:35,811
Oh, we can't get to the TARDIS!

6
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:39,465
No, Victoria, I'm afraid we can't.

7
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:41,499
What's happened to Chorley, then?

8
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:47,495
That's what I'm wondering. Did he reach the TARDIS before the fungus, or... or did he not?

9
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:50,452
You mean to say, he could have got to the TARDIS and already have taken off in it?

10
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:51,896
I don't know...

11
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:53,060
Hey, come back, Doctor!

12
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:58,326
It's alright, Jamie, I'm not going to do anything silly. I...
I just want to try and get a little bit for an analysis.

13
00:27:58,618 --> 00:27:59,616
Oh Jamie, stop him!

14
00:27:59,843 --> 00:28:01,027
It's alright, Victoria.

15
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,083
Has anyone got a box?

16
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:06,976
I've got my tobacco tin.

17
00:28:07,315 --> 00:28:08,515
Oh, splendid.

18
00:28:08,742 --> 00:28:09,974
But then, it's got tobacco in it.

19
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:10,888
Never mind.

20
00:28:11,112 --> 00:28:16,858
Eh!... Oh, alright. I only hope you think the sacrifice is worth it!

21
00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:19,996
Hold the tin for me, would you, Evans?

22
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,427
Gone and set it off! Come on, now!

23
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:28,487
Oh, it's horrible!

24
00:28:28,678 --> 00:28:29,888
Go on, Doctor, get it out!

25
00:28:30,103 --> 00:28:31,065
Hold the tin underneath!

26
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:34,596
There we are - now back, everyone, quickly!

27
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:43,686
Hello, Staff. It's alright, it's just Staff Arnold!

28
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:48,776
One of these days, Evans my lad, you're going to creep up onto someone once too often!

29
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:50,830
Well, that's life, innit Staff?

30
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:52,074
Any luck at Holborn?

31
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:53,197
No - fungus.

32
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,365
Same back there.

33
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,590
Right. I'll tell the Colonel. You lot had better get back to HQ. We'll be along in a few minutes.

34
00:28:58,855 --> 00:29:01,176
Come on, Jamie, I'll just show this bit of fungus to Travers.

35
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:01,992
Right.

36
00:29:06,729 --> 00:29:08,683
Hey, look at this!

37
00:29:09,094 --> 00:29:11,574
Good Lord! That's Yeti!

38
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:13,791
You don't think they may still be here?

39
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:14,717
I hope not!

40
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:16,028
Oh, Doctor!

41
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,632
D'you reckon they have?

42
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:25,783
Have what?

43
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:27,535
Taken him? Like she said?

44
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:35,563
Yes, I'm very much afraid they have. But why? Why didn't they just kill him? Unless...

45
00:29:35,812 --> 00:29:36,695
Yes?

46
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:38,498
Well, unless they had a use for him.

47
00:29:40,658 --> 00:29:42,758
Ah, Doctor. What's this I hear about Travers?

48
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:52,090
'Scuse me, sir, but I think you ought to come to the Ops Room.

49
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:53,219
Why? What's happening?

50
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,231
That fungus stuff, it's on the move again!

51
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:08,744
It's like a spider's web, ain't it?

52
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:13,254
Yes. And we're the flies, alright, but... where is the spider?

53
00:30:13,876 --> 00:30:15,614
Better give the others a hand, Corporal.

54
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:16,429
Sir.

55
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:25,690
Doctor. Been thinking about what you were saying earlier,
about someone here in HQ being responsible for all this.
Could it have been Travers?

56
00:30:26,184 --> 00:30:27,024
I doubt it.

57
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:29,516
Well, after all he has disappeared.

58
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:34,815
Yes - so has Chorley. I'd say he was a much more likely suspect.

59
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:35,877
True.

60
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:41,471
On the other hand, of course, whoever is in league with the Intelligence could still be amongst us here.

61
00:30:42,782 --> 00:30:49,822
That's a fact of which I am uncomfortably aware.
But tell me, Doctor, this Intelligence - exactly what is it?

62
00:30:50,404 --> 00:31:04,617
Well I wish I could give you a precise answer.
Perhaps the best way to describe it is a sort of formless, shapeless thing
floating about in space like a cloud of mist, only... with a mind and will.

63
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:06,810
What's it after? What's it want?

64
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:10,952
I wish I knew. The only thing I know for sure is that it brought me here.

65
00:31:11,854 --> 00:31:13,074
Brought you here?

66
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:15,238
Yes, been wondering how you got here.

67
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:23,971
Yes, well I... I don't think there's any harm in telling you now. 
I...I have a craft, that travels in time and space.

68
00:31:25,023 --> 00:31:27,253
Oh, come now Doctor, you can't expect me to...

69
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:32,134
This craft of yours, this time-space craft. Could it get us out of here?

70
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,418
Well, yes - but it's at Covent Garden!

71
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:37,006
What does it look like?

72
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:39,345
It's a police box.

73
00:31:39,612 --> 00:31:41,464
Oh really, Colonel, surely you're not...

74
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:45,012
So - if we could rescue that craft, you could take us out?

75
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,018
Yes, yes I could, but I have to stay here and finish Travers' work!

76
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:54,409
Ah, Doctor. Miss Travers is feeling alright now, and would like to see you right away.

77
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:57,184
Very good, Jamie. Excuse me, gentlemen, please.

78
00:31:57,453 --> 00:31:57,967
Yes.

79
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:02,095
Well, I've heard some stories in my time, but that one really takes...

80
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:03,193
So you don't believe him?

81
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:07,269
No, of course not, sir! The whole idea is screwy. A police box!

82
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:11,024
Well whether you think it foolish or not, we are going to rescue that craft.

83
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,837
Oh, but sir! Our job...

84
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:25,633
Captain Knight. The Army has failed to defeat this menace.
Now the Doctor thinks he might succeed. Personally, I doubt it.
But if we stay here, we're as good as dead.
Therefore I do not intend leaving any escape route unexplored, however... screwy you may think it.

85
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:26,774
Oh, surely Colonel...

86
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:28,411
Let's get on with it, shall we, Knight?

87
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:29,432
Sir.

88
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:36,914
But... but there must be a chance! If the Doctor says...

89
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:51,054
No, the soldiers could comb these tunnels for a fortnight and still never find him.
I'm afraid your father's been taken by the Intelligence.
The only way that we can save him is by finding the central control source.

90
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:53,046
Aye, if he's anywhere, that's where he'll be.

91
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:57,180
But why? Why him? Why not me, or one of the soldiers, or...

92
00:32:57,357 --> 00:33:07,121
Yes, I know. Tell me, what was your father working
on just before the Yeti broke in, Anne?

93
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:11,360
Um... oh, we were ready to test the sphere with the control unit

94
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,960
but I don't see what this has to do with anything, Doctor.

95
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:17,721
But don't you? If he was near to success...

96
00:33:17,966 --> 00:33:19,206
That's why they took him!

97
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,765
Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?
Now Anne, do you feel strong enough to come back to the laboratory?

98
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:24,979
Yes, yes of course.

99
00:33:25,152 --> 00:33:25,932
Anything we can do?

100
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:27,083
No, no, you just take it easy, Jamie.

101
00:33:30,014 --> 00:33:31,237
What's the matter?

102
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:36,761
I've been thinking about what the Doctor said.
Anything we do, the Intelligence always knows!

103
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:40,579
Aye, but I wouldn't let it worry you. The Doctor will soon find a way out.

104
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:42,521
I wish I could believe that.

105
00:33:44,411 --> 00:33:49,126
Oh yes. Yes, this seems to be in order, Anne.

106
00:33:49,855 --> 00:33:55,489
My father didn't want it put together until this was in proper order.

107
00:33:55,735 --> 00:33:57,344
Very wise. Let's have a look at this...

108
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:03,425
Oh yes, yes... My word, this is a splendid piece of work, Anne.

109
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,134
Thank you.

110
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:09,097
Yes, this should control the sphere, alright, but would it override the commands issued by the Intelligence, I wonder?

111
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:13,040
No. No, I'm afraid it won't. I just didn't have the time. Do you think we can do it?

112
00:34:13,228 --> 00:34:15,229
Oh, we can do it, if you've got the right bits and pieces.

113
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:19,197
Hope I'm not disturbing, Doctor, but Staff asked me to give you this.

114
00:34:20,832 --> 00:34:21,950
Where'd you get this?

115
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,411
On the floor, by that young lad Weams, it was.

116
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:31,378
But this is what brought the Yeti to the explosives store!
It's obviously been reprogrammed as a homing device, and you've given it to me!

117
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:35,149
Here! You don't think I had anything to do with these Yeti, do you?

118
00:34:35,356 --> 00:34:38,875
Doctor! The other models - they've gone!

119
00:34:40,572 --> 00:34:50,504
Well don't look at me! I didn't want to come down here in the first place!
I shouldn't be down here at all, really. Driver, I am, see.
You'd better have this, before you say I've nicked it.

120
00:34:50,894 --> 00:34:51,733
Thank you.

121
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:53,953
And I'll have the tin back, when you've finished with it.

122
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:57,634
Don't look so unhappy - we're all under suspicion, you know, including me.

123
00:34:57,975 --> 00:34:58,648
Hmm!

124
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,073
What's in the tin, Doctor?

125
00:35:01,477 --> 00:35:09,707
It's the fungus from the tunnel. I thought if we examined it, it might give us a clue.
I must get this dismantled. It's like holding a time bomb.

126
00:35:11,434 --> 00:35:16,662
So my party will get above ground and approach Covent Garden by Neal Street. Is that clear?

127
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:23,086
Now Staff here will be taking the trolley through the tunnel, and will arrive, we hope, at the same time as we do. You picked your two men, Staff?

128
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,959
Yes, sir. Lane and Evans.

129
00:35:25,472 --> 00:35:28,799
Right. Now as soon as we get there, we shall be looking for a police box.

130
00:35:29,304 --> 00:35:30,132
A police box, sir?

131
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:34,636
Yes, a police box. Now I want that box either out of the station or onto the trolley as quickly as possible. Is that understood?

132
00:35:34,814 --> 00:35:35,370
Yes, sir.

133
00:35:35,544 --> 00:35:36,272
Right. Any questions?

134
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:38,775
Yes, sir, this, um... police box. Is it important?

135
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:42,110
Corporal Blake, we'd hardly be going to this trouble if it weren't.

136
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:44,717
Who's going to look after the civilians, sir?

137
00:35:45,078 --> 00:35:51,213
I'd like you to stay behind and look after them, Captain Knight.
The Doctor's got work to do. Right gentlemen, time to go.

138
00:35:51,557 --> 00:35:52,335
Ah, Doctor.

139
00:35:52,524 --> 00:35:53,307
Oh Jamie, what is it?

140
00:35:53,477 --> 00:35:54,795
The Colonel says to tell you he's on his way.

141
00:35:54,975 --> 00:35:55,972
On his way where?

142
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:57,429
To rescue the TARDIS!

143
00:35:57,597 --> 00:35:58,409
He's wasting his time.

144
00:35:58,543 --> 00:36:01,151
Well that's what I told him. And I think that man Chorley must be behind...

145
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:04,471
Now look! Get behind me, both of you, and keep clear. Here we go...

146
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:08,884
No!

147
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,981
What is it, Doctor?

148
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:14,988
The tin's empty!... Evans!

149
00:36:16,623 --> 00:36:23,312
Course, really I shouldn't be doing this, you know, Staff.
Not officially on the strength down here, see.
What I am really is a driver, you see...

150
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:26,684
Don't try to come the old soldier with me, lad!

151
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:28,110
Who, me?

152
00:36:28,427 --> 00:36:35,472
Yes, you! And when we get in the tunnels, don't you try to skive off,
 'cos if you do I'll have you for breakfast. D'you understand?

153
00:36:36,454 --> 00:36:37,352
Trolley's ready, Staff.

154
00:36:37,581 --> 00:36:38,363
Right, come on!

155
00:36:49,175 --> 00:36:53,881
So far, so good. If we don't see any Yeti, we should make Covent Garden in about ten minutes. Come on!

156
00:37:02,317 --> 00:37:04,852
Captain, they've gone, and Evans with them, I think. I can't find him anywhere.

157
00:37:05,078 --> 00:37:07,652
Yes, well we'd better question Evans carefully when he gets back.

158
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:08,918
Aye, if he gets back.

159
00:37:09,122 --> 00:37:12,147
It's a funny business, Doctor, that fungus disappearing.

160
00:37:12,453 --> 00:37:19,925
Yes, yes I know... Don't worry about that just at the moment.
I've been working on this control box with Miss Travers.
There's a few more things I need - transistors, circuits...

161
00:37:19,932 --> 00:37:20,844
Aren't there any in Stores?

162
00:37:21,043 --> 00:37:22,200
No, not of the right type.

163
00:37:22,401 --> 00:37:24,007
Well in that case, Doctor, I can't help you.

164
00:37:24,194 --> 00:37:27,595
Well - I was wondering... if I could go up to street level...

165
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:29,324
The mist! Or the Yeti!

166
00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:31,692
There's no mist directly above us here - we'd have to risk the Yeti.

167
00:37:31,902 --> 00:37:33,491
No. No, I'm afraid that's out.

168
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:35,565
It's terribly important. Please!

169
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:37,719
It'll only take five minutes.

170
00:37:38,418 --> 00:37:40,426
Alright. I'll get my gear.

171
00:37:40,735 --> 00:37:42,106
Well done, Travers!

172
00:37:43,707 --> 00:37:47,496
The Colonel will be through there at Covent Garden in a few minutes, right?

173
00:37:47,926 --> 00:37:50,371
Do you think they'll be able to load the police box on here, Staff?

174
00:37:50,683 --> 00:38:00,479
Well, if we can get this thing through the fungus stuff -
there's not much of a gradient in this section of the tunnel.
Right, I want one volunteer.

175
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:04,392
Volunteer? That's a dirty word, that is. Not me!

176
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:05,410
Lane?

177
00:38:05,604 --> 00:38:06,513
What for, Staff?

178
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,263
Well, if this thing wants some help going through to Covent Garden, I'm going through with it...

179
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:11,321
Into that stuff?

180
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:12,716
Have we got those respirators?

181
00:38:13,303 --> 00:38:14,277
Well yeah, here.

182
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,632
I reckon we should be all right in these.

183
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:26,962
Oh all right, Lane lad. I'll go by meself.

184
00:38:27,835 --> 00:38:32,654
No, 'ang on a sec, Staff. That trolley's heavy, it'll take two of us to shift it.

185
00:38:33,587 --> 00:38:35,926
Good lad. Come on.

186
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:37,597
You're potty, the pair of you!

187
00:38:37,827 --> 00:38:42,663
Shut up, will you! Do as you're told.
Play that rope out as we go; any sign of trouble whip us out sharpish. Right?

188
00:38:42,898 --> 00:38:43,711
Well, it's your neck.

189
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:44,418
OK.

190
00:38:44,643 --> 00:38:45,388
Alright then...

191
00:39:11,738 --> 00:39:15,774
Staff? Staff Arnold?...

192
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:44,669
Look, sir!

193
00:39:48,474 --> 00:39:49,414
In Here! Quick!

194
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:54,562
Come on, through the gate!

195
00:39:57,002 --> 00:39:59,077
I'm going to find a way out. Split up!

196
00:40:20,116 --> 00:40:21,722
Yetis - three of them, sir!

197
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:22,763
Grenades!

198
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:31,260
Right, fire!

199
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,033
Sir, they're smashing down the gate!

200
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,354
We can't hold 'em, sir!

201
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,455
Over the top, all of you!

202
00:41:27,025 --> 00:41:28,278
Grenades!

203
00:41:45,887 --> 00:41:47,614
Through the yard, come on!

204
00:41:54,052 --> 00:41:55,029
Right, bazooka here to cover the others.

205
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:13,361
Dawson! Langley!

206
00:42:31,288 --> 00:42:37,756
Make for the warehouse!... Murphy!

207
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,479
There it is again, Doctor!

208
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,704
Just one more thing.

209
00:43:03,852 --> 00:43:05,509
For heaven's sake, hurry up!

210
00:43:05,724 --> 00:43:08,337
I just need one more component. I'll look through here.

211
00:43:23,328 --> 00:43:25,228
Doctor! Doctor, look out!

212
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:29,454
No! No!

213
00:44:00,975 --> 00:44:02,523
And this was in his pocket, you say?

214
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:06,146
How did he get it? You said it was stolen.

215
00:44:06,676 --> 00:44:08,260
You can't think that he...

216
00:44:08,495 --> 00:44:12,729
No no no, he didn't steal it. The person who did planted it on him.

217
00:44:13,106 --> 00:44:13,734
Hmm!

218
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:19,269
Eh, don't you try and pin this on me, boyo! Strikes me, anything goes wrong around here and I'm always the one to get the blame.

219
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:24,999
Alright, alright, let's keep our temper, shall we? The point is, two of these were missing. Now where's the other one?

220
00:45:27,044 --> 00:45:35,372
There. That one shouldn't bother us any more.
Now then, come along, Anne, let's get down to work. 
Where did I put those bits and pieces?

221
00:45:35,393 --> 00:45:37,973
I wish I knew who put it in the Captain's pocket.

222
00:45:38,156 --> 00:45:39,824
Well it must have been Chorley.

223
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:40,903
Well look, he left ages ago.

224
00:45:41,082 --> 00:45:42,313
It doesn't matter. He could still...

225
00:45:42,598 --> 00:45:43,380
Colonel!

226
00:45:43,598 --> 00:45:44,409
Are you alright?

227
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:45,755
What's happened?

228
00:45:46,401 --> 00:45:47,656
Colonel, what happened?

229
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:49,826
Gone.

230
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:51,510
Not all of them?

231
00:45:52,405 --> 00:45:54,308
All of them?

232
00:45:54,529 --> 00:45:59,681
I said so, didn't I? All of them. Evans, what about your party?

233
00:46:01,227 --> 00:46:02,032
Arnold?

234
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:03,170
Gone, sir.

235
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:05,544
Captain Knight, too.

236
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,970
Knight! Hopeless.

237
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:22,059
Can't fight them - it seems... indestructible. Can't fight them!
 You were right, Doctor, when you said they were... formless, shapeless... you were right.

238
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:29,076
Listen... listen, everyone! It's the other Yeti model! It's here! It's somewhere in this room!

239
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,955
That noise, I've been hearing it on and off all day...

240
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:31,856
Your pockets!

241
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:32,610
What?

242
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,913
Open your pockets, Colonel! Quickly, quickly, come on!

243
00:46:36,684 --> 00:46:38,128
How... how...

244
00:46:38,303 --> 00:46:39,622
They bring the Yeti!
