1
00:46:47,774 --> 00:46:48,802
Oh no!

2
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:50,371
I just don't understand what's happening!

3
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:51,354
Poor Travers!

4
00:46:51,593 --> 00:46:52,874
Silence!

5
00:46:53,092 --> 00:46:53,798
Father!

6
00:46:53,993 --> 00:46:54,935
No, no! No!

7
00:46:55,216 --> 00:46:56,012
But I must...

8
00:46:56,217 --> 00:46:58,033
No, Anne! Don't go near him. Just... just listen to him.

9
00:46:58,207 --> 00:47:03,923
I... am... the Intelligence!

10
00:47:04,926 --> 00:47:19,974
Listen to me! I speak to you with this man's voice
because the time has come for you to understand my purpose.

11
00:47:20,444 --> 00:47:21,472
What's he getting at?

12
00:47:21,651 --> 00:47:22,360
Quiet!

13
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:23,615
What do you want?

14
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:27,265
You defeated me in Tibet, Doctor.

15
00:47:27,522 --> 00:47:28,079
Yes.

16
00:47:28,321 --> 00:47:36,485
Now you have fallen into the trap that I have so carefully prepared for you.

17
00:47:36,796 --> 00:47:37,698
What do you want?

18
00:47:38,372 --> 00:47:55,449
You! Your mind will be invaluable to me. Therefore I have invented a machine
 that will drain all past knowledge and experience from your mind.

19
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:57,016
But you'll kill him!

20
00:47:57,459 --> 00:48:05,560
Oh, no. He will survive, his mind unharmed - only empty

21
00:48:05,781 --> 00:48:06,848
You can't - we'll fight!

22
00:48:07,124 --> 00:48:13,449
That will not do. The Doctor must submit willingly.

23
00:48:13,848 --> 00:48:16,955
And if I... if I do submit, what of the others?

24
00:48:18,054 --> 00:48:20,859
Then the others will go free.

25
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,950
And my father too?

26
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:31,756
Oh, him too. I'm only using his body to communicate with you.

27
00:48:32,807 --> 00:48:34,491
He didn't help you before, then?

28
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:44,653
Oh, no. I have many other human hands at my command.

29
00:48:44,966 --> 00:48:45,855
And who are they?

30
00:48:47,755 --> 00:49:02,168
Always questioning! Even now, you're seeking to destroy me! I see I shall have to guide your thoughts.

31
00:49:03,917 --> 00:49:04,910
No, Jamie, no!

32
00:49:09,754 --> 00:49:21,152
Cooperate and the child will be unharmed. You have twenty minutes to make up your mind.

33
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,158
Let me go, Doctor!

34
00:49:23,382 --> 00:49:25,217
Jamie, don't be a fool! You don't stand a chance.

35
00:49:25,438 --> 00:49:26,524
Let me go! Victoria!

36
00:49:28,074 --> 00:49:29,063
Let me past, Colonel!

37
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:32,273
No. The Doctor's right. There've been enough lives wasted.

38
00:49:36,543 --> 00:49:41,997
Please... my wrist... Professor!

39
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:52,090
Eh! Wait a minute!

40
00:49:52,273 --> 00:49:54,091
What is it, Evans, what's the matter now?

41
00:49:54,277 --> 00:49:55,194
Stand back everyone!

42
00:49:59,507 --> 00:50:01,060
I thought I heard it go!

43
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:07,904
Yes, well we'd better make sure. Evans - you, myself and McCrimmon will go and search the place. Doctor, you'd better stay behind here and get on with your tinkering.

44
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Professor, please, you're hurting me! My wrist! Professor!

45
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:35,872
Yes... yes, that should complete the circuit, good... I wonder...

46
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:39,016
There's only one way to find out.

47
00:50:39,224 --> 00:50:42,253
Yes. Certainly no sound out there.

48
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:43,978
Shall we chance it, then?

49
00:50:44,181 --> 00:50:45,394
Why not?

50
00:50:47,817 --> 00:50:48,704
Now!

51
00:50:49,235 --> 00:50:50,875
No! Back! No!

52
00:50:51,138 --> 00:50:58,327
Push! Push! Push, hard as you can! Push, get your back to it! Get your back to it!

53
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:01,758
Fire door - by the stairs - go and unhitch it, and I'll try to hold this. Go on, McCrimmon!

54
00:51:01,945 --> 00:51:02,349
You sure?

55
00:51:02,557 --> 00:51:04,174
Yes, go on! Go on!

56
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:12,280
Alright, Colonel, come on!

57
00:51:16,696 --> 00:51:24,770
Strange, it's not picking up. The Intelligence must be transmitting... I wonder why it's not working...

58
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,476
Aha! Success! It's going, Anne! Come along.

59
00:51:31,665 --> 00:51:35,522
Oh, oh that's marvellous. I'm sorry I'm being so long - this is such a fiddling job.

60
00:51:35,685 --> 00:51:36,848
Help you in a minute...

61
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,284
There we are. Now then...

62
00:51:40,232 --> 00:51:42,130
Yes, you see, it's homing!

63
00:51:43,585 --> 00:51:44,277
There we are... 

64
00:51:46,409 --> 00:51:47,922
Do we go on or turn back?

65
00:51:48,143 --> 00:51:49,195
Let's go on.

66
00:51:49,547 --> 00:51:50,520
Right.

67
00:51:54,867 --> 00:51:56,265
Come on, what are you waiting for?

68
00:51:57,299 --> 00:51:58,760
Hey, wait a minute!

69
00:51:59,652 --> 00:52:02,365
This is Victoria's! We're on the right track!

70
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,896
No, don't shoot!

71
00:52:20,023 --> 00:52:21,461
Is that thing on our side, then?

72
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:23,190
It is now. Stop!

73
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:27,822
Were you scared?

74
00:52:28,316 --> 00:52:35,297
Eh? Oh no, no, I mean, I just got up here to get a better aim, that's all. How did you make it stop then?

75
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:37,408
Simple - I told it to.

76
00:52:45,313 --> 00:52:50,165
Here - ball. Why don't you go back where you come from?

77
00:52:53,928 --> 00:52:55,201
Now, pull the other one.

78
00:52:55,402 --> 00:52:56,728
Oh, show him, Doctor.

79
00:52:57,158 --> 00:53:00,719
Alright, I will. Move forward.

80
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:08,521
Stop... Move to the left... Stop.

81
00:53:09,393 --> 00:53:10,747
There you are, how about that?

82
00:53:11,228 --> 00:53:14,713
Hey, that's great! Make a smashing toy, that would.

83
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:17,263
Toy? That's a highly complex piece of equipment.

84
00:53:17,429 --> 00:53:20,079
Oh, is it? Well I don't see how it's going to help us.

85
00:53:20,244 --> 00:53:21,955
But it obeys our commands!

86
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:22,800
So?

87
00:53:22,948 --> 00:53:27,102
Well, once we get it inside a Yeti, we'll have a powerful ally!

88
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:28,286
Inside a Yeti?

89
00:53:28,464 --> 00:53:29,971
Yes, certainly. Will you help us?

90
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:36,161
You must be joking, Go near one of them things? I may be stupid, but I'm not daft...

91
00:53:36,439 --> 00:53:38,581
Oh very well, Anne, I shall have to do it myself.

92
00:53:38,736 --> 00:53:39,711
Oh, I'm coming with you, Doctor.

93
00:53:39,874 --> 00:53:40,661
No no, it's far too dangerous.

94
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:41,810
There you are, what'd I tell you?

95
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,402
Not another word, I'm coming with you.

96
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:47,000
Hold it.

97
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:55,112
Staff Arnold? It can't be, we'd given you up for lost!

98
00:53:56,446 --> 00:53:57,702
Easy, easy...

99
00:53:58,017 --> 00:53:58,887
That's it.

100
00:53:59,084 --> 00:54:00,295
Sorry about this, sir.

101
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:01,304
What happened?

102
00:54:01,486 --> 00:54:20,419
I don't know. Can't remember. I were pushing the trolley through the fungus, and...
and I blacked out. I thought I were... falling. When I come to, sir, I were in the tunnels...
Where's the Doctor, sir? I met the Professor and the girl back there...

103
00:54:20,664 --> 00:54:21,661
Victoria! Is she alright?

104
00:54:21,849 --> 00:54:26,801
Yeti - guarding them, but... I promised I'd tell the Doctor, sir.

105
00:54:26,998 --> 00:54:28,010
Right. Come on, back to HQ.

106
00:54:28,187 --> 00:54:29,130
I'm going for Victoria.

107
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:33,690
Really, we'd stand a better chance if we stick together. Go ahead! Come on, Staff.

108
00:54:33,852 --> 00:54:35,288
Doctor's twenty minutes' almost up.

109
00:54:46,856 --> 00:54:49,350
Evans, come out from behind that board.

110
00:54:52,718 --> 00:54:53,878
Oh, it's you, sir.

111
00:54:54,112 --> 00:54:55,104
Where's the Doctor?

112
00:54:56,706 --> 00:54:57,605
Evans!

113
00:54:57,895 --> 00:54:59,038
B-b-but y-y-y-you...

114
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:02,657
Stop bleating like a Welsh baa-lamb, Evans, and answer the Colonel.

115
00:55:02,896 --> 00:55:03,393
Sir?

116
00:55:03,543 --> 00:55:05,028
Doctor and Miss Travers, where are they?

117
00:55:05,213 --> 00:55:05,924
Gone, sir.

118
00:55:06,142 --> 00:55:07,087
Gone - where?

119
00:55:07,286 --> 00:55:08,261
Warren Street, I think.

120
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,159
Why?

121
00:55:09,418 --> 00:55:10,541
After a Yeti, they said.

122
00:55:10,748 --> 00:55:11,777
Have a look at the board, sir.

123
00:55:11,983 --> 00:55:13,218
Warren Street.

124
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:14,698
Come on!

125
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:18,672
No, not you, Staff. Evans, make yourself useful. Get a dressing for the Staff Sergeant's head.

126
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,429
Yes, sir.

127
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:21,021
Thank you, sir.

128
00:55:23,307 --> 00:55:24,803
We're trapped!

129
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,307
Give me the control box, Anne.

130
00:55:28,602 --> 00:55:29,526
The control box...

131
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:30,292
Yes.

132
00:55:30,486 --> 00:55:31,122
Haven't you got it, Doctor?

133
00:55:32,361 --> 00:55:33,839
What! What... hold the sphere!

134
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,398
Oh Doctor, you must have it!

135
00:55:35,954 --> 00:55:36,694
Yes...

136
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:39,874
Doctor!

137
00:55:40,325 --> 00:55:42,290
Don't worry, it'll work!... It's got to work!

138
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:50,259
I know you said it only worked at short range, but for a moment...

139
00:55:50,655 --> 00:55:58,394
Well, don't tell me you were worried? Would you like to hold this for me?

140
00:56:07,885 --> 00:56:09,634
It's alright, it's quite safe.

141
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:13,436
Nearly out... there.

142
00:56:14,932 --> 00:56:16,038
Right.

143
00:56:20,575 --> 00:56:23,620
Now then - turn round!

144
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:27,989
Oh, it works! You've done it!

145
00:56:28,205 --> 00:56:36,610
We've done it, you mean! Now then, with my reprogrammed sphere and your control box,
we should be able to work him over quite a distance. And put your arm down!

146
00:56:37,923 --> 00:56:39,994
Now we've got a chance, Anne. Come on!

147
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:43,477
Oh, mustn't forget him. Come on, Fred, at the double!

148
00:56:46,972 --> 00:56:48,599
Staff! Staff!

149
00:56:48,994 --> 00:56:49,892
What is it?

150
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:53,569
What is it, Evans?

151
00:56:58,196 --> 00:57:02,530
Go on, Evans lad, get out of it!
