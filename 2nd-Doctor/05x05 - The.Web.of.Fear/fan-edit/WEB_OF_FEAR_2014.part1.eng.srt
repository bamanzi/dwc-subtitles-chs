1
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:13,498
Mr Silverstein?
Yes. Who are you?

2
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:16,227
Anne Travers. Is my father here?

3
00:00:16,387 --> 00:00:20,619
Yes, he's here.
Come and see him and take him away.

4
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,778
He's a fool. An old fool!

5
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:25,461
Father?

6
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:28,698
Father...

7
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:31,618
Anne...

8
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:35,663
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

9
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,176
You were supposed to be meeting me.

10
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:42,779
- Was I?
- At the airport.

11
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:47,940
What's wrong? You send me a cable
saying you're in grave trouble.

12
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:51,622
- I fly half the way round the world...
- Trouble? Yes.

13
00:00:51,787 --> 00:00:55,905
A great deal of trouble. It's that thing.

14
00:00:56,587 --> 00:00:58,578
The Yeti?
Mm.

15
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:02,023
You're a stupid old fool, Julius Silverstein!

16
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:07,181
ME the fool? You would like me to be the fool
and give you back my Yeti, huh?

17
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:10,737
You must, man. Don't you understand?
It's dangerous.

18
00:01:10,907 --> 00:01:16,425
For 30 years this stands here in my museum,
and now he tells me it is dangerous!

19
00:01:16,587 --> 00:01:20,978
- I wish I'd never brought it back from Tibet.
- Father, what has happened?

20
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:25,584
The silly old goat won't listen to me.
I've told him, warned him.

21
00:01:25,747 --> 00:01:30,662
- Damn it, he knows it's a robot!
- But, Father, the Yeti isn't dangerous.

22
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:33,864
It can't work unless it has a control unit.

23
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,302
But I've done it, Anne!

24
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:38,856
I HAVE reactivated the control unit.

25
00:01:39,947 --> 00:01:42,541
But, Father, this is wonderful news.

26
00:01:42,707 --> 00:01:46,177
Is it? Yes, I suppose it would be,
except for one thing.

27
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:48,338
What?

28
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:50,304
The sphere - it's gone!

29
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:54,699
It's disappeared! You must let me
have the Yeti back, Julius.

30
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:58,744
Make him understand, Anne!

31
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:00,898
I understand.

32
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:03,740
I buy the Yeti off you 30 years ago.

33
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:06,501
Now, it is valuable.

34
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:10,057
You try to scare me, take your Yeti back.

35
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:12,218
Why? Money!

36
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:16,585
- You want to rob me!
- I'll buy the thing back if that's what you want!

37
00:02:17,587 --> 00:02:20,659
No, no. It's priceless.

38
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:23,580
The only one in the world, and it is mine.

39
00:02:23,747 --> 00:02:25,544
- You fool!
- Thief!

40
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:28,016
- I'm not a thief.
- Swindler!

41
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:29,540
Stubborn old goat!

42
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:33,256
- Father!
- Take him away - out of my house!

43
00:02:33,427 --> 00:02:35,418
Perhaps you've made a mistake.

44
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:40,138
You've put the sphere away
somewhere in your laboratory and forgotten it.

45
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:43,777
- You've done it before.
- No. I've looked everywhere.

46
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:47,986
Let's go home and look again, shall we?
You know what you're like.

47
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:49,500
Yes, but suppose...

48
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:53,740
Let's go and have a quiet dinner,
and you can tell me all about it.

49
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,580
Then we'll go home and look for the sphere.

50
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:01,222
Well, all right...
But I warned you, Julius! I warned you!

51
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:03,059
Get out! Take him away!

52
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:07,106
Nobody destroys Julius Silverstein's collection!
Nobody!

53
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,542
- Come on, Father.
- The Yeti's mine!

54
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:12,267
You can't scare me with your mad stories.

55
00:03:13,347 --> 00:03:15,497
Out! Out!

56
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:49,341
Travers...

57
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:53,056
It is you? I am not frightened
by your stupid tricks!

58
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:55,218
Travers! I know it's you.

59
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:56,740
I'm not a fool!

60
00:04:24,427 --> 00:04:26,179
Agh!

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:48,000
(theme)

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
(the web of fear)

63
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,078
Some sort of grille.

64
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:14,681
Don't say you've landed us in a prison!

65
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,156
It could be the dungeons of a castle.

66
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:18,680
It's so dark.

67
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,838
Ah, steps.

68
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:23,316
Come along. Be careful.

69
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:32,805
Yes...

70
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,958
It seems to be a large room.

71
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,118
Tiled walls.

72
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:39,278
Curved ceiling.

73
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:41,358
Come on.

74
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:48,038
The floor seems to end here.

75
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:51,916
There's a sort of trench. Look.

76
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:56,524
- Hey, Doctor. Come and look at this.
- What have you found, Victoria?

77
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:58,678
See for yourself.

78
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:04,677
"Covent... Garden... "

79
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:10,285
Yes, of course! It's an underground station.
We're standing on the platform.

80
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:13,280
- Underground station?
- Underground trains.

81
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:17,486
- A little after your time, Victoria.
- Is it always as dark as this?

82
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:22,243
No, it's probably the middle of the night.
Come on. Let's go up top.

83
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:29,955
- Professor Travers is here, sir.
- Why have I been brought here? Who are you?

84
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:32,004
- Knight.
- Never heard of you.

85
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,158
Captain Knight. OK, Corporal.

86
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:37,084
It's no good shouting at me.

87
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,636
- I didn't ask for you.
- Who did, then?

88
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:43,322
- Your daughter.
- Anne? Just like her mother.

89
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,398
Always interfering in things!

90
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:48,525
I understood that you'd sent for her to help you.

91
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:50,325
What do you want me for?

92
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:56,960
- I don't. I think this is a military matter.
- Well, you haven't had much success so far!

93
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:04,961
Army What the devil do they know about it?

94
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:13,405
- The Doctor was wrong!
- It's not night-time. It's broad daylight.

95
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:20,397
- Just let me get my breath... Those stairs!
- It looks like we're locked in.

96
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,478
- That's strange.
- Doctor...

97
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:25,161
- Yes?
- Listen.

98
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:26,840
I can't hear anything.

99
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:34,920
Oh... It IS quiet. I see what you mean. The
middle of London. There should be some noise.

100
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,840
There's an old man over there. Let's ask him.

101
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:39,918
Yes, go on.

102
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,759
Excuse me...

103
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:46,918
Excuse me...

104
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:52,444
Who are you?

105
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:56,516
- Harold Chorley. London Television.
- What? Television?

106
00:07:56,687 --> 00:08:00,726
- Never watch it. Are you an actor?
- Journalist, actually.

107
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:07,284
The government decided to only allow one
correspondent down here. The press chose me.

108
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,324
Oh, yeah?

109
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:14,277
Will you be in charge of the scientific section,
or will your daughter?

110
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:16,438
Mind your own business!

111
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:21,400
How long do you think it will take you
to come up with the answer?

112
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,082
- One week? Three, perhaps?
- How the hell should I know?

113
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:27,078
- Is that working?
- Of course.

114
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:32,360
It's more than likely
we may not be able to defeat this menace.

115
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:37,203
The whole of England might be completely
wiped out. There - did you get that?

116
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:02,599
- What are you doing?
- Just confirming something.

117
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:06,885
Just as I thought.
There haven't been any trains here for some time.

118
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,038
What's that over there?

119
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:18,920
It's a power cable.
I wonder what it's doing down here.

120
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:21,078
In there quickly!

121
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:58,363
Soldiers? I wonder what they're doing down here.

122
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,998
- Let's go and ask them.
- No. I think we'd better tread carefully.

123
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,920
Let's go and find out what's going on first.

124
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,917
What do you want us to do, Doctor?

125
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:20,682
You follow the soldiers, but keep out of sight.

126
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:25,967
I'm going to see where this cable goes to.
Meet back here in a few minutes.

127
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:39,445
- What's the matter?
- I thought I heard something.

128
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:44,044
- Getting a bit jumpy, aren't you, Weams?
- It's no wonder, is it, Staff?

129
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:47,961
- Shall we connect the new drum now, Staff?
- All right, Corporal.

130
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:52,086
- Good thing we fixed these lights.
- Yeah.

131
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:01,882
- I can't hear anything.
- Are they still there?

132
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:04,880
I think they must be moving. Come on.

133
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:08,125
Agh!

134
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:14,083
- I told you I heard something, didn't I?
- Yeah.

135
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:16,158
Come on!

136
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:18,966
- I'm sorry!
- It was only a cobweb!

137
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:23,166
- Do you think they heard?
- Hope not. Come on.

138
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:37,121
Well, well, well, would you believe it?
The Babes in the Wood!

139
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:09,498
- You're quite sure there was nobody with you?
- How many more times?

140
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,464
That's all right, then.

141
00:13:12,787 --> 00:13:16,097
- Clear to fire, Staff?
- Yes, they were on their own.

142
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:18,258
Right.

143
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:20,418
What was all that about?

144
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,540
I suppose there's no harm in telling you.
You two are very lucky.

145
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:28,460
- We're going to blow up the tunnel.
- What?!

146
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:31,266
- That's what the cable's for.
- The Doctor!

147
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:40,625
It's all right. They were on their own.
OK, let's not waste any more time. Off you go.

148
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:44,418
Agh!
