<b>The Macra Terror: Episode 3</b>
(2019 Animated version)

3
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:35,698
Keep away. Don't touch me.

4
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:37,201
- I'll obey.
- What's that? What's happening!

5
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:40,143
Doctor, that was it - that thing
in the picture! The Claw!

6
00:00:40,222 --> 00:00:41,843
They're in control.

7
00:00:42,027 --> 00:00:43,557
Take them out of here.
They're condemned to the pits.

8
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:46,161
Come on. Get out, all of you.
Out! Get out!

9
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:50,569
Stand by work shift. Stand by in the pits.

10
00:00:50,653 --> 00:00:52,218
Work shift standing by.

11
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:54,878
The strangers are being sent
to you for pit labour.

12
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:56,178
Put them in the Danger Gang.

13
00:00:58,382 --> 00:01:00,122
Your orders are correct, Pilot.

14
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:03,622
The strangers must be sent to
explore the new gas reserves.

15
00:01:04,082 --> 00:01:07,102
They are dangerous people.
They must be disciplined.

16
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:08,322
Yes, Control.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,501
You will forget all that happened.

18
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:11,792
Yes, Control.

19
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:14,913
The Colony enjoys hard work and happiness.

20
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:17,913
We will not tolerate
the evil of such strangers.

21
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:19,099
Yes, Control.

22
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,199
You must serve the Colony.

23
00:01:21,493 --> 00:01:22,879
Keep watch on your friends,

24
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:26,549
and if you see anything suspicious,
report to me immediately.

25
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:27,724
Yes, Pilot.

26
00:01:30,294 --> 00:01:36,344
# We are all happy to work.
# We are all happy to work.

27
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:38,944
- # For the good of the Colony
- Ooh! Ooh!

28
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:40,020
What's the matter?

29
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:42,232
Dreadful. Did you hear that rhyme?

30
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:44,532
The man who wrote that ought to be
sent to the Danger Gang - not us.

31
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:47,087
- Ha, ha, ha.
- All right. That's enough.

32
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:50,229
Ah, are these the three strangers?

33
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:51,222
Yes.

34
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:53,318
Yes, you might call us that.

35
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:55,519
They've been allocated 176 shift.

36
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:59,251
Oh, very good, Ola. I'll...
I'll recall the shift leader.

37
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:05,052
What an extremely remarkable place.
What efficiency.

38
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:06,352
What ever do you make?

39
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:07,165
Silence.

40
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:09,661
I thought this was a mine.
You know, where you dig up coal?

41
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,433
Ah, yes. But here, you see,
the rock foundation is a type of salt.

42
00:02:12,613 --> 00:02:15,293
Now, at depths it generates gases
over the years,

43
00:02:15,393 --> 00:02:17,033
and these gases are extremely valuable.

44
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:19,784
Don't bother to explain to them.
Just get them to work.

45
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:22,850
Aye. Well, you don't send a lassie
and an old man down to dig.

46
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,717
Old? What do you mean old?
I'm not old, Jamie.

47
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:25,822
You'll do as you're ordered.

48
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:27,751
Here's the leader of their shift, sir.

49
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:31,436
Very well. Report any irregularities to me.

50
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,535
Medok. How did you get here?

51
00:02:34,724 --> 00:02:37,209
Huh! They threw me out of the correction hospital.

52
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:38,509
Apparently I'm a hopeless case.

53
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,678
But why did they send you here?

54
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:41,402
The one remaining punishment they could think of...

55
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:43,910
- to work in the Danger Gang for life.
- For life?

56
00:02:44,015 --> 00:02:46,677
Oh, don't worry. You don't survive long
in this atmosphere.

57
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:49,927
It's the gas. It gets everywhere.
It creeps into your lungs.

58
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:52,577
And when you're down there,
you're right in the thick of it.

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,372
Come on, Medok. Take them to their work.

60
00:02:54,462 --> 00:02:55,701
What's the hurry?

61
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:56,893
You don't want me to call the guard, do you?

62
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:58,246
All right. All right. We're going.

63
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:01,146
But, we are entitled to
a supervisor on this shift.

64
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:02,673
Ah, yes. That's true.

65
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,662
Yes. Well, I'm leaving this man.

66
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:08,088
Hmm? Oh. Well, yes.
I suppose that's all right.

67
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:10,933
But, it's much safer up here.
Isn't it, Medok?

68
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,516
- It is.  - Ah, I see.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,208
I'm perfectly capable of
working in the pit, thank you.

70
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,558
Polly can have the safe job.

71
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:21,365
Uh, no. You stay up here, Doctor.
I wouldn't know what to do.

72
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,547
Well, I'm not sure I understand
all this machinery myself.

73
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:26,860
Do you not think you might make
better use of the opportunity, Doctor?

74
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,181
What do you mean? Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

75
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,871
Yes. I'll be supervisor.

76
00:03:32,517 --> 00:03:33,492
What was all that?

77
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:35,363
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

78
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:36,663
Come on you two.

79
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:41,181
Oh, you're going to issue them
with masks, aren't you?

80
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,181
You aren't taking them down there
without any protection?

81
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:45,874
Surely you could have seen to that?

82
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:53,274
Oh, ah, here. You'd better take this,
um... this checklist.

83
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:56,457
But I... I would have liked a mask.

84
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:06,847
This really is remarkable. Most interesting.

85
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:11,347
Yes. I suppose with a little adjustment...

86
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:16,901
Hello, Ben. Don't go.
Come in. Don't be afraid.

87
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:21,151
I have nothing to be afraid of.

88
00:04:21,383 --> 00:04:22,209
No. Of course not.

89
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:24,909
It wasn't your fault
you betrayed your friends.

90
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:26,883
The voices tell me what to do.

91
00:04:27,388 --> 00:04:29,637
The voices may not be right, Ben.

92
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,154
I do what I am told.

93
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:33,980
Yes, I know.
That's why you're here, isn't it?

94
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:36,628
To spy on me.

95
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:41,628
What does Control want to know this time?

96
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:46,128
Won't you answer me?

97
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:49,628
You know, Ben, this is very unlike you.

98
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:56,183
I...I don't know what you mean.
It is my duty.

99
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,979
It's hard for you to struggle
against the voices, isn't it, Ben?

100
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,979
I warn you, if you spy on the others,
watch out Jamie doesn't catch you.

101
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:06,979
He's not so tolerant as I am.

102
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:14,721
Hurry up. Put on your equipment.

103
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:17,469
You shouldn't make lasses do the work of men.

104
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,409
The Danger Gang will do as they are told.

105
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:21,009
It's a punishment for their failure to cooperate.

106
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:24,353
We do all the dirty work.
We go where the gas is worst.

107
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:27,472
It's your own fault, Medok.
If you obeyed Control...

108
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:29,601
All right. All right. Forget it.

109
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:33,151
I prefer Control poisoning my lungs,
to their trying to poison my mind.

110
00:05:33,712 --> 00:05:34,695
What's that?

111
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:36,210
It's a gas strike.

112
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,709
Go on! Help with the cable there.

113
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:41,309
Go on. Hurry up. That's the alarm.
This gas is lethal!

114
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:42,877
What does he mean?

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,507
He means they've struck so much gas,
they can't channel it off.

116
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,107
When it reaches a certain density,
that alarm bell goes.

117
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:50,580
- Hurry up! Get that cable to the strike.
- Come on. Quickly.

118
00:05:57,436 --> 00:06:00,654
Quickly. Come on. Pull there.

119
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:02,554
Pull, all of you. Pull. Pull.

120
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:04,133
- Polly!  - Leave her.

121
00:06:04,253 --> 00:06:06,657
Get that cable to the strike.

122
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:14,867
Get her away from here. Away.

123
00:06:14,982 --> 00:06:17,867
Jamie, the head of the cable. Got it? Right.

124
00:06:17,982 --> 00:06:19,867
Put your masks on. They're in your pocket.

125
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,767
Right. Now, help me with this.

126
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:30,367
Hold it. Hold it, Jamie.

127
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:38,167
Right. Right.

128
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:42,982
What's it all for?

129
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:48,152
It's a poisonous gas which we mine,
from the bowels of this planet,

130
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:50,052
which kills us if we breathe it.

131
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:52,552
No one knows what it's used for.

132
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:12,683
Yes.

133
00:07:13,523 --> 00:07:18,201
Now one must assume that
the relative connection is constant.

134
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:21,201
Now, let me see.

135
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:57,801
Yes. I think that's right.

136
00:07:58,492 --> 00:08:00,801
I should give myself ten out of ten.

137
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:05,610
Oh, you did give me a turn.

138
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,190
Where did you find it?

139
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,258
What?

140
00:08:08,383 --> 00:08:09,222
The formula.

141
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:12,081
In my head. You know.

142
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:15,839
Don't lie. That is a secret known
only to three people in the Colony.

143
00:08:16,494 --> 00:08:17,471
And you're one of them?

144
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,315
Naturally. And you're not asking me to believe...

145
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:22,615
that in a few moments you have been
able to work out a formula...

146
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:25,915
which it has taken our
combined computers years to perfect?

147
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:27,652
It does seem rather a tall order.

148
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:31,262
Yes, of course. I know what you've done.

149
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:33,862
You've broken into our secret files,
haven't you?

150
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,967
I wouldn't know how to do that. Take a look.

151
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:40,285
Well, you must have seen the document.
That's the exact computation.

152
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:42,919
Really? Huh. In that case...

153
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:49,622
Do you really mean to say
that you worked that out by yourself?

154
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:53,086
Well, I did have a little assistance.

155
00:08:53,305 --> 00:08:54,948
Yes, I thought so. Who was it?

156
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:57,541
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. No person. No.

157
00:08:57,823 --> 00:09:00,541
I simply mean that I took readings
from the various dials.

158
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:02,101
They appeared to be related,

159
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:04,361
so I worked out the principle
that controls them.

160
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,961
It was simple really.
Like doing a sum backwards.

161
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:08,902
- Backwards?
- Yes. You know...

162
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,742
Given the answer, what's the question?

163
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,053
Wipe it away. Get it off there
before anybody else sees it.

164
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:17,887
Oh, well. If you insist.

165
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:22,586
Ho, ho. There now.

166
00:09:22,706 --> 00:09:25,659
If anyone follows that formula,
there'll be an almighty explosion

167
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:27,959
x to the power of y is derivative 2 3's of 6!

168
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:29,237
Get it off.

169
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,122
What are they doing?

170
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:43,834
We call that probing.

171
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,464
You're not looking for more gas?

172
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,080
Oh, yes. We never stop!

173
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:50,174
There's a door here. Where's it lead to?

174
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:53,624
I've no idea. To my knowledge,
those doors were never opened.

175
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:55,005
Could be an old shaft.

176
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:58,372
Why would it need such a new door?
And so strong?

177
00:09:58,762 --> 00:10:00,202
Hey, look out!

178
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:02,209
Ah, you've made the connection?

179
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:04,779
Of course. Otherwise you wouldn't be here.

180
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,201
Now, be careful, Medok.

181
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,861
There are other places worse than
the Danger Gang, you know.

182
00:10:09,197 --> 00:10:12,645
This is a high pressure strike.
You are going to need a stronger screw than this.

183
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,887
- Don't touch it.
- I know what I'm doing.

184
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,867
- He's fainted.  - Aye. He must have...

185
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:25,613
What are you doing?

186
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:31,673
- What has happened to him?
- He's had a wee whiff of the gas.

187
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,645
Get him up. I'll look after him.

188
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,645
Yeah. It's all right, mate. Hang on.

189
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,122
How long do you think Ben was watching us?

190
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:45,312
I don't know.

191
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,608
Do you think he saw you take the keys?

192
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,313
- Well, if he did, we're in trouble.  - Yes.

193
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:50,342
It just means we'll have to make
use of them quick as we can.

194
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:51,970
But where, Jamie. And how?

195
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:53,653
Let's try that wee door first. Come on.

196
00:10:57,253 --> 00:10:58,778
Give me the word if anybody comes.

197
00:10:58,881 --> 00:10:59,929
Right.

198
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,700
Lookout.

199
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,400
OK

200
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,762
Hey, you two, give us a hand.

201
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:16,565
Um, all right. I'd better go.

202
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,374
Just a minute Polly. This key's turning. Oh.

203
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:19,953
Good luck.

204
00:11:20,926 --> 00:11:23,078
Aye. It fits. Come on, Pol...

205
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:29,916
Come over here, everybody. Lend a hand.

206
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:56,969
What's that?

207
00:11:57,781 --> 00:11:59,375
It's impossible.

208
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:00,940
Is it more gas?

209
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:02,489
No. It's an escape.

210
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:05,689
That bell means that
someone has escaped down here.

211
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:07,723
- It's Jamie.
- Your friend? That door!

212
00:12:08,015 --> 00:12:09,654
I'm going with him.

213
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:13,005
Hey wait! Don't leave me down here.

214
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,845
We couldn't have an alarm.
It's impossible.

215
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:20,543
No one ever escaped.

216
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,645
Calling Pit Guard.

217
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,945
Close exits to all gas shafts.

218
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,245
Stand by. A prisoner has escaped. Shoot on sight.

219
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:34,973
But, if no one can escape...

220
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:40,039
My keys! My keys! They were on my tunic.

221
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:42,740
You must have dropped them.

222
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:46,426
Special guards to cover
all exits to the old shaft.

223
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:51,426
With Pilot's permission,
they may have to go on forbidden ground.

224
00:13:14,754 --> 00:13:21,761
Jamie? Jamie? Jamie? Ah!

225
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:23,900
Ah!

226
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:30,383
Hello? Who's there?

227
00:13:37,237 --> 00:13:40,799
No permission is granted for the guard
to go on forbidden ground.

228
00:13:40,937 --> 00:13:42,439
Repeat, no permission.

229
00:13:42,537 --> 00:13:45,839
They are not to cover the exit to the old shaft.

230
00:13:45,937 --> 00:13:47,999
This is in use at this moment by Control.

231
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:50,699
No one is to go in or near the old shaft.

232
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:51,999
Top priority.

233
00:13:54,246 --> 00:13:55,924
They seem very emphatic about that.

234
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:57,860
Control knows best.

235
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,221
But what if your prisoner escapes that way?

236
00:14:01,296 --> 00:14:03,950
- What will happen to you?
- I shall be punished.

237
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:06,303
Well, aren't you going to do
something about it?

238
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,605
Control knows best.

239
00:14:10,315 --> 00:14:12,190
Who has escaped anyway?

240
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:14,743
We shall soon find out.

241
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:20,866
It is Jamie.

242
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:23,713
How do you know that, Ben?

243
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:25,913
I saw him take the keys.

244
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,617
And you didn't report it?

245
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:30,636
- No.  - Why not?

246
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,150
I don't know. I don't seem to
be able to think straight.

247
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:38,597
Ben, you're recovering.

248
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:41,497
I always thought you were
a tough customer. Well done!

249
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:44,891
Control knows best.

250
00:14:45,142 --> 00:14:46,754
You don't seem very sure.

251
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:50,232
Jamie took those keys. I must report him!

252
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:50,248
Doctor, you know what's happened?

253
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:52,091
Yes. Jamie's got free.

254
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:54,221
By my calculations
he's got a very good chance.

255
00:15:54,273 --> 00:15:56,521
- Hold that for me, will you?
- What do you mean?

256
00:15:56,895 --> 00:15:59,093
Well, as I understand it,
Jamie's in the old shaft.

257
00:15:59,251 --> 00:15:59,928
Yes. That's right.

258
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,885
And for reasons of their own,
Control don't want anyone there.

259
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,385
It's forbidden territory.

260
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:07,743
- So you think he'll be all right?
- I don't know.

261
00:16:07,912 --> 00:16:10,673
I'll be able to tell you when I've
tested this to see how lethal it is.

262
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:13,272
But what's that got to do with Jamie?

263
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,487
On this planet it's got
a lot to do with everybody.

264
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,686
There now. Yes.

265
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,330
Oh, Doctor. What on earth are you doing?

266
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,734
I'm trying to analyse this gas,
and I'm not having very much luck.

267
00:16:29,032 --> 00:16:31,484
Is that the same stuff that we've
been pumping out of the pits?

268
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:33,589
Yes. And they go to great efforts to get it.

269
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:35,089
The question is why?

270
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,549
Ssh! Somebody's coming.

271
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,312
Ooh! Mustn't find this.

272
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:46,397
Oh, the Pilot's not here. Let me help you.

273
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:47,697
No.

274
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,285
Always lend a helping hand.

275
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,386
A willing friend makes the task lighter.

276
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:55,065
I'll wait for the Pilot.
If I'm going to tell anybody...

277
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,807
You are, aren't you?

278
00:16:58,076 --> 00:16:59,691
I don't know what I'm going to do.

279
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:03,291
I got these voices in my head.

280
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:05,691
Sometimes I just think
I'm having a bad dream.

281
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:09,116
But the voices are here to help us.
They are our friends.

282
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:14,665
That's it. What about my friends?

283
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:45,421
I'll see you are reported for this.
If this were not an emergency...

284
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:48,566
The bell stopped. Why has it stopped?

285
00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:51,085
Because, young lady, the emergency is over.

286
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:54,140
Does that mean he's been caught?

287
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,153
It means they're closing in on him.

288
00:18:08,315 --> 00:18:10,423
Thank you. But, why didn't you tell this to Officia?

289
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,561
You told me to report back to you.

290
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:14,641
I see. Very well.

291
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:18,541
The stranger who has escaped is
in the old shaft.

292
00:18:18,634 --> 00:18:20,041
Control will now give instructions.

293
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:26,594
All guards will leave the area of the old shaft.

294
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:30,294
No one must go near it,
even in search of the stranger.

295
00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:34,094
Do not approach its exit or entrance.
Do not go in.

296
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:36,994
Officials are to stand by at the gas centre.

297
00:18:37,211 --> 00:18:38,622
We will obey, Control.

298
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:44,378
Gas centre standing by.
What transfers do you wish made?

299
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:47,902
Prepare for gas to be diverted into the old shaft.

300
00:18:47,977 --> 00:18:50,402
Inspect connection immediately and report back.

301
00:18:57,327 --> 00:18:59,582
The old shaft. Doctor, that's where Jamie is!

302
00:18:59,758 --> 00:19:02,343
They're going to pour this gas
in the old shaft

303
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,343
- gas they value above all else.

304
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:06,143
What do you make of that, Polly?

305
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:08,568
For goodness sake, Doctor.
What are you going on about?

306
00:19:08,744 --> 00:19:14,455
Don't you see? Control are not pouring
this poisonous gas into the old shaft to kill Jamie.

307
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:16,455
They've quite another reason.

308
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,464
Doctor, you've got to do something to help him.

309
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:33,839
Before we act, we must think.

310
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:36,639
Now, the Macra that have come to
the surface of this planet

311
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:39,139
have not found sufficient gas in the atmosphere,

312
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:41,939
so they've had to get somebody to
pump it up from down below.

313
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:44,358
But, if it's life and death to them,
why do they waste it?

314
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:47,558
- Why divert it into the old shaft?
- That's obvious, Polly. Obvious.

315
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,819
Because there's something trapped down there
they wish to keep alive!

316
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:13,108
Officia reporting. All connections
have been tested.

317
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:16,208
They are all one hundred percent serviceable.

318
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:18,508
Transfer of all gases may now
be made to the old shaft.

319
00:20:20,742 --> 00:20:22,069
Stand by for action.

320
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:27,786
The Colony. The Colony is happy to obey.

321
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:31,786
The Colony is happy to obey.

322
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,983
We've got to help him.

323
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:35,843
I'm doing my best, Polly.
I'm thinking at top speed.

324
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:37,943
There's a pattern involved here
- a combination of pipes.

325
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,343
If one were to follow this one...

326
00:20:41,034 --> 00:20:42,729
Stand by gas Officia.

327
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:46,929
All flow is to be channelled
through systems seven and eleven.

328
00:20:47,402 --> 00:20:48,921
Seven and eleven. Now which are they?

329
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,028
All channels are ready.

330
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:53,752
Prepare to turn on at half blast.

331
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:55,469
All ready.

332
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:56,727
Now!

333
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:22,408
Seven and eleven. If that's the system in use,

334
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:25,108
it must go from here round up to there.

335
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:27,723
Officia is to increase pressure.

336
00:21:28,585 --> 00:21:29,949
Doctor, quickly.

337
00:21:30,236 --> 00:21:31,999
Polly, I think I've found the gas flow.

338
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,860
The pressure's being increased.

339
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:58,962
Turn on full pressure now.

340
00:22:00,383 --> 00:22:02,652
Full pressure in action!
