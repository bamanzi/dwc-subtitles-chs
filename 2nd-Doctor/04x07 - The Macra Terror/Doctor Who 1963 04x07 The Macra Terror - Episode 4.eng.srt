1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:32,537
Retain full pressure.

3
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,073
Full pressures being maintained on master control. Reserves are standing by.

4
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:42,803
Let me see. Let me see.

5
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:45,027
Doctor, what could be happening to Jamie now?

6
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:51,336
I hate to think. It won't be anything very pleasant. Polly, go and see what the first dial on the control desk registers.

7
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:52,209
Right.

8
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:53,621
Hurry up.

9
00:01:57,548 --> 00:01:58,447
Full pressure.

10
00:01:58,694 --> 00:02:03,175
Full pressure. And the other one? Come on.

11
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:06,445
Zero.

12
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:13,281
Zero. Now I think there's only one thing for it. Plus must be made minus and minus must be made plus.

13
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:16,000
What's the matter?

14
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,849
The question is which is plus and which is minus?

15
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,159
Ooh.

16
00:02:45,413 --> 00:02:46,856
What are you doing?

17
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,227
Oh, just checking.

18
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:49,639
Well, I don't need your help, thank you.

19
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:52,180
As you please. But, uh, I think you're going to run into trouble.

20
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:53,710
Why? What's the matter?

21
00:02:53,913 --> 00:02:56,589
Well, according to my calculations, the pressure gauges are wrong.

22
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:57,891
Don't be ridiculous.

23
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:08,329
Ridiculous? Well, that's as may be. But, after all, three times three is nine, and if you divide by half of its own cubic capacity to the formula, Pi over four squared, I think you'll have to agree with me.

24
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,626
Don't touch that.

25
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:10,503
Why not?

26
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:14,163
That's the... That controls the inflow system.

27
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:17,986
Oh. So these are the inflow pipes, are they? That's all I wanted to know.

28
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:19,142
But what are you doing?

29
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:24,924
Inflow. Inflow. Outflow. Inflow. High pressure. Low pressure and O-U-T spells out.

30
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:26,233
Doctor, what are you doing?

31
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:28,131
It's alright, Polly. Confusion is best left to the experts.

32
00:03:28,277 --> 00:03:29,810
But... Stop it! You've no idea what you're doing.

33
00:03:29,974 --> 00:03:38,431
Oh, yes I have. I can stand an operation on its head quicker than anyone. There! I think you'll find I've revolutionised the entire gas flow of the Colony.

34
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:40,929
You must be mad. You'll be locked up.

35
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,747
Polly, see what those dials register now.

36
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:45,614
Right. Doctor? Something's happened to this one.

37
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:46,787
What does it read?

38
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:47,830
It's reads zero.

39
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:49,083
And the other one?

40
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:50,177
Full pressure.

41
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:55,376
Good. Splendid. That means there'll be a fine old gale of fresh air blowing along the old shaft any time now.

42
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:12,483
Ah! Ah! Let go! No! Let... Not yet, you're not.

43
00:04:19,587 --> 00:04:24,381
You can do nothing. You'll only delay matters. It's a simple matter for me to reconnect the gas.

44
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:26,439
Yes, I'm sure it is. But I'm sure you'd like a little help.

45
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:28,862
Now stop that. You've enough to answer for already.

46
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:32,627
Guard! Guard!

47
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,712
It's all right, Polly. I've got his keys. Lock the door.

48
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,449
Send the guard, immediately!

49
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,673
They're bound to get in sooner or later.

50
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:48,648
Yes. Well, the later the better. The only thing we can do for Jamie now is to give him time. Lock the door.

51
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:23,197
This is Control. Why has the outflow of gas stopped? Gas must be pumped into the old shaft without interruption. Begin pumping immediately.

52
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:29,583
I need help immediately. The strangers obey nothing. They are turning taps in the wrong direction.

53
00:05:29,818 --> 00:05:31,653
Guards have been detailed to assist you.

54
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:32,740
Open up in there!

55
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:37,755
Keys! My keys! Where are my keys?

56
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:41,207
Oh, dear. Your keys. Try, uh, in your pocket. Or on the gantry. Or over there.

57
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:42,314
Look, I know you've got them.

58
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,902
Doctor, the door.

59
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:46,069
Open up in there or we'll smash it in.

60
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,183
It's going to give way.

61
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:48,436
Come on, Polly. Let's get out of here.

62
00:05:49,253 --> 00:05:52,328
No, not that way - it goes to the pits. Quick. Try that one.

63
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:53,375
It's locked.

64
00:05:53,597 --> 00:05:56,109
Then use the keys. Quick, Doctor. Quick!

65
00:05:58,164 --> 00:06:01,629
Over there. Quick! Stop them before they do any damage.

66
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:02,457
Get them!

67
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:09,728
Push, Polly! Push!

68
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:13,954
I can't!

69
00:06:14,203 --> 00:06:19,549
You've got to. Come on. Together. I've nearly got it locked.

70
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,195
There we are.

71
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,229
Where are we?

72
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:38,567
Well, it looks rather like a cupboard with a lot of pipes.

73
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:41,050
Where do you suppose they lead?

74
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:44,274
They must lead somewhere. Let's have a look.

75
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:51,906
Doctor, I think these are the pipes that carry the poisonous gas.

76
00:06:52,175 --> 00:06:53,446
Yes, very likely.

77
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,370
Well, don't you think we'd better stay here?

78
00:06:56,725 --> 00:07:00,839
Stay here? I'm not spending the rest of my life with a lot of old pipes.

79
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:02,190
But Doctor...

80
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:11,529
Now, come along Polly. I'm sure there's no need to be afraid. Well... well, I think there's no need to be afraid. Oh, come on. Let's find out.

81
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:30,642
There, that ought to do it. Let's hope we're not too late.

82
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:11,605
What do you know?

83
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:14,646
We all know Control is right, and we must obey!

84
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,415
Let them know. Let them know.

85
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,069
Let them know they're happy!

86
00:08:18,253 --> 00:08:19,490
Greet the morning with a shout.

87
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:21,115
Everyone up. The sun is out.

88
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,156
Rah, rah, rah!

89
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:29,140
Rah, rah, rah! Cheer for the Colony. We're the gang that works the hardest, and we must obey. Obey Control. Ring the bell.

90
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,234
Rah, rah, rah!

91
00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:31,134
Rah, rah, rah!

92
00:08:31,374 --> 00:08:32,067
Work well.

93
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,426
Ring the bell!

94
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:43,395
Oh, that's much better. But, we'll do it again, and this time with more feeling. Ah! And don't forget our job is to inspire the others - our brave workers who are doing such a dangerous job. All right?

95
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,508
All right!

96
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:45,894
What do you know?

97
00:08:46,098 --> 00:08:48,801
We all know Control is right, and we must obey!

98
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:50,738
Let them know. Let them know.

99
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,424
Let them know they're happy!

100
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:54,169
Greet the morning with a shout.

101
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,788
Everyone up. The sun is out.

102
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:56,692
Rah, rah, rah!

103
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:57,546
Rah, rah, rah!

104
00:08:57,755 --> 00:09:04,510
Oh, that's very good! That's beginning to sound like something. It still needs a bit more clarity, and I think that the girls could...

105
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:09,194
Say! how did you get there?

106
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:11,994
Oh, w... well, uh... I just, um... as a matter of fact...

107
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,368
Oh, I see. You're one of the dancers.

108
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:20,373
One of the dancers? Oh, I'm afraid, uh... Aye. Aye, y... y... yes. I'm one of the dancers.

109
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:21,719
And you got your dance ready?

110
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:25,585
My dance? Ah... Well, uh... Yes. Yes, it's ready.

111
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,020
Well, go ahead. I'll see it now.

112
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:29,428
You'll see it now?

113
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:34,876
And don't forget you have to be very good to get into the Happy Colony finals. We want something gay and cheerful.

114
00:09:35,194 --> 00:09:36,337
Gay and cheerful?

115
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:37,810
Have you any music?

116
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,789
Ah, no. I don't need it.

117
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,410
Go ahead. We'll pick up the rhythm and clap to it. All right?

118
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:43,552
All right!

119
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:47,670
Well, come on. Get on with it. We haven't got all day.

120
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,200
Oh, aye.

121
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:59,000
That's very good. What do you call it?

122
00:09:59,205 --> 00:10:00,051
The Highland Fling.

123
00:10:00,258 --> 00:10:01,567
Why do you call it the Highland Fling?

124
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:04,534
Because we finish the dance by flinging ourselves out the door.

125
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,038
Oh, that's very good! Come on now. Rah, rah, rah!

126
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:07,838
Rah, rah, rah!

127
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:09,367
Cheers for the Colony. Rah, rah, rah!

128
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:11,150
Where did this boy come from?

129
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:12,573
Oh, he's one of the dancers.

130
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:18,537
Nonsense. He's the escaped stranger. You there - identify him. Is this the boy you reported?

131
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,859
Well... Well... Yes.

132
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:23,386
Ben, you gave me away.

133
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:32,820
Tie him up. Go to the Pilot. Tell him the stranger's found. Tell him it won't be long before we get our hands on his friends as well.

134
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,156
Jamie, I'm...

135
00:10:40,694 --> 00:10:46,643
No permission for the guards to go on forbidden ground. Repeat, no permission. They are not to cover the exit to the old shaft. This is in use at this moment by Control. No one is to go near the old shaft.

136
00:10:46,884 --> 00:10:47,674
Shh. I hear voices. Very faint.

137
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:49,341
I don't hear anything.

138
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:51,387
Stay here a minute, Polly.

139
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,068
No. Don't leave me.

140
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,993
The search for the other strangers must be carried on.

141
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:59,259
The Controller. The voice behind the screen.

142
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:05,528
All guards are detailed to hunt for the Doctor and the girl. They must be taken dead or alive.

143
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:09,816
Look! He must be there.

144
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:32,502
This is Control. The day shift is to begin work in the emergency gas shaft. All pressures are to be maintained. The Colony cannot live without gas!

145
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,630
So that's where all the gas goes.

146
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:40,576
Yes. Just as I thought. These creatures would die without it.

147
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:45,381
But how long have they been there? I mean, they weren't always in control, were they?

148
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:56,834
I couldn't tell you when they were here in the first place, Polly. They're like germs in the human body. They've got into the body of this colony. They're living as parasites.

149
00:11:57,164 --> 00:11:58,787
You make it sound like a disease.

150
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:00,433
Polly, that's what I think they are.

151
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:05,830
They're in the control room. It must be like getting into the brain, mustn't it?

152
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:08,347
Yes. Very likely.

153
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:14,659
Shh. They might hear you.

154
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:20,541
Now then. One system must provide them with the gas they need, and the other one must be an outflow.

155
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:25,486
Doctor, we've got to bring the Pilot here. Then we can show him these creatures really do exist.

156
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:29,134
Yes, Polly, I think it might work.

157
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:31,519
Look at me when I talk to you.

158
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:36,515
Ola, a word with you. Where exactly did you catch him?

159
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:38,803
In here. In the hall, Pilot.

160
00:12:39,228 --> 00:12:41,136
I see. So, in fact, he gave himself up?

161
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:43,157
He should never have been allowed to escape.

162
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:45,109
Are you criticising Control?

163
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:46,815
I'm criticising the running of the pits.

164
00:12:47,022 --> 00:12:48,421
But that is my job, Ola.

165
00:12:48,608 --> 00:12:56,653
I know that. But were it not for my guards, this stranger would still be a danger to all of us. I am going to report to Control that there is no discipline in the pits.

166
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:57,875
That's not the only report that Control will get!

167
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:04,742
Ever since these strangers arrived your authority in this colony has gone to pieces. They come and go as they please, and even now two of them are still missing.

168
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:20,383
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Well, everyone is up bright and early. And the last two strangers are not missing after all. Oh, come now. You can't have bad temper and differences of opinion in this happy type colony. Say you're sorry, Ola. Say you're sorry, Pilot.

169
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,704
Doctor, what did ye come here for? You've walked into a trap.

170
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,635
Good morning, Jamie. Nice to see you so well cared for.

171
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:26,594
Yes, but Doctor...

172
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:33,271
Oh, it's all right. I've just come in to have a word with my old friend, the Pilot. Good morning, Ben. I hope you're feeling more your old self?

173
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,653
Yes, Doctor. I am.

174
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:37,527
Why did not your guards arrest these strangers?

175
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:39,849
I don't know. Guards, arrest them!

176
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,455
That is no longer necessary.

177
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:46,063
Of course not. You can't arrest us now we've given ourselves up. That's against the rules.

178
00:13:47,808 --> 00:13:49,553
Now. You wish to see me?

179
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:51,492
Yes. I do. Urgently. Come with me.

180
00:13:53,516 --> 00:14:05,534
This is Control. Everyone is to return to work immediately. This order includes all executives. It includes the Pilot. Everyone back to work immediately.

181
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:06,685
Well, I shall have to go.

182
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:11,612
No, wait. You must listen to what the Doctor's got to tell you. They're only saying that because they know what we've seen.

183
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:12,444
At once!

184
00:14:12,662 --> 00:14:13,442
Pilot.

185
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,843
At once! That is an order!

186
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:19,321
Don't take any notice of them. That's not your Controller. Those are your enemies.

187
00:14:19,612 --> 00:14:21,688
There must be no discussion with the strangers!

188
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,822
Why not?

189
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:24,088
Aye. What are you afraid of?

190
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:27,474
Arrest the strangers! That is an order! All the strangers!

191
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:29,650
That doesn't sound like a man in control.

192
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:33,747
What did you wish to tell me?

193
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,236
Pilot. You heard Control. Guards, take them all away.

194
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:41,514
I am still the Pilot here. You will take your orders from me. Get back to your quarters.

195
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,208
Contact Control immediately. Report the Pilot!

196
00:14:45,326 --> 00:14:47,491
That was a very brave thing to do.

197
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:49,996
Or very foolish. What is it you wanted to tell me?

198
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,137
Come with me.

199
00:14:51,443 --> 00:14:52,014
Pilot!

200
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:53,343
You will all remain here.

201
00:14:53,637 --> 00:14:55,870
He disobeyed Control. The Pilot will be arrested.

202
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:56,860
No.

203
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,145
Anything may happen now, Jamie. We've got to be ready to run for it.

204
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:01,738
We can't leave the Doctor.

205
00:15:01,961 --> 00:15:05,522
He'll be back in a minute, and Ben seems to be all right now.

206
00:15:05,765 --> 00:15:08,441
More like the old Ben, I must admit. But you still canna...

207
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,789
Where is he?

208
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,842
But, Doctor. This is forbidden territory.

209
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:31,344
Yes, and you'll soon see why.

210
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:33,350
Stop! Stop! You're breaking the law!

211
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,643
Bad laws were made to be broken. Follow me.

212
00:15:35,874 --> 00:15:36,524
But...

213
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:43,326
What's happened to the Pilot, Ola? The strangers have changed him!

214
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,918
The Pilot is a traitor.

215
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,747
The Pilot has no more authority. Ola is in command!

216
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,028
I really don't know why I trust you, Doctor.

217
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:57,773
Oh, perhaps I've got an honest face.

218
00:15:58,096 --> 00:16:03,418
The Pilot is to be arrested! This is a happy colony! All must obey!

219
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:04,481
Did you hear that?

220
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,024
Don't give up now. It's just up here.

221
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:23,050
All guards to report to the pit head. They are to take orders from Ola. It is understood.

222
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:39,960
There you are. That's what's taken over this colony. You haven't been in touch with Control, but with these. They've used this colony for their own ends, destroying you to live themselves.

223
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:45,919
Why they're horrible. No, Doctor. It is they who must be destroyed. We must kill them.

224
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,878
They're here!

225
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:50,706
Let's go.

226
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:54,827
The Pilot and the stranger! In forbidden territory! They must be destroyed!

227
00:16:55,997 --> 00:17:00,659
So, what are they, Doctor? I mean, some monstrous form of bacteria? Insects? Or what?

228
00:17:00,873 --> 00:17:02,824
I don't know. But you must fight them.

229
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:03,957
How?

230
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,803
Take full command!

231
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,297
You mean defy Control?

232
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,018
Well, you see what Control really is.

233
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:12,887
Yes. You're right, Doctor, they must be destroyed.

234
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:33,576
We've been waiting for you.

235
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:37,028
Ola, the Colony is in the hands of grotesque insects!

236
00:17:37,254 --> 00:17:38,733
So you've been seeing things?

237
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:40,356
They're in there. The Macra!

238
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:44,169
Ha, ha, ha. You know what happens to people that say that?

239
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:45,097
But I...

240
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:47,060
Now we can deal with you all together.

241
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:48,474
Did the Pilot has see them?

242
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,856
Yes. I saw the Macra.

243
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:53,290
It is forbidden to say that. Don't let him say that he has seen Macra!

244
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,066
I saw you! You are the Macra!

245
00:17:56,312 --> 00:18:01,060
Silence! Silence the three strangers! That is an order!

246
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:02,561
What shall we do with them, Control?

247
00:18:02,811 --> 00:18:09,160
Return them to the pipe room. The three strangers and the Pilot. They are to be locked in, and you will not let them out.

248
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:10,110
Come on, get in.

249
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:10,838
Ola.

250
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:11,948
Doctor!

251
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,472
Come on. You heard Control.

252
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:16,372
Don't worry Polly, I'll look after ye.

253
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:17,095
No!

254
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:18,400
Take your hands off her.

255
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:21,413
Get in!

256
00:18:24,846 --> 00:18:26,746
You have done well, Ola.

257
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:28,566
What instructions, Control?

258
00:18:29,123 --> 00:18:34,329
Clear the building. Guards and workers are to return to the hall for music.

259
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:35,667
I obey, Control.

260
00:18:36,877 --> 00:18:46,288
It will take precisely four minutes, and then it will be safe for everyone to return to work. Four minutes.

261
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:48,969
Why four minutes?

262
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,781
Aye, what can they do in four minutes, Doctor?

263
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,388
I don't know. We must be ready for anything.

264
00:18:56,313 --> 00:18:58,278
It's a gas! It's coming in here.

265
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,616
Pilot, do you know where it's coming from?

266
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:02,967
Why, no. I've never been here before.

267
00:19:04,931 --> 00:19:06,364
There must be a hidden inlet.

268
00:19:06,783 --> 00:19:10,345
You will not be able to fight it. You cannot stop it.

269
00:19:11,882 --> 00:19:12,871
Doctor, I'm getting dizzy.

270
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:14,651
Polly, hold that in front of your mouth.

271
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,390
It's coming from over here, Doctor!

272
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,426
You're right, Jamie!

273
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:19,870
It's coming from here as well!

274
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,789
You are unable to stop it.

275
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:26,945
Polly?

276
00:19:27,371 --> 00:19:32,340
It will not last long. Only for four minutes. By that time, you...

277
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:35,500
Come on! Let us out!

278
00:19:35,994 --> 00:19:38,115
...will be completely helpless, not quite dead, helpless.

279
00:19:39,364 --> 00:19:40,546
Hello in there.

280
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:41,871
Who is it?

281
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:42,803
Ben.

282
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:46,802
Ben? Is that you? Are you all right?

283
00:19:47,073 --> 00:19:48,716
Can you open the door from your side?

284
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:49,726
No.

285
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:51,317
But it's locked. There isn't a key.

286
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:56,033
Ben, listen. We've got very little time. It's all up to you.

287
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:57,887
Go ahead Doctor. Tell me what to do.

288
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:04,794
Go to the control desk, and you'll see two switches, one marked outflow and one marked inflow.

289
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:05,862
Hang on.

290
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:19,373
The other stranger has recovered. He is now dangerous! He will no longer obey Control. The fourth stranger is trying to help his friends. He is no longer one of us. He must be stopped at once!

291
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:21,781
I've got them, Doc. Two switches. What next?

292
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:25,593
Good. You see a lever in front of them?

293
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:26,424
Yeah.

294
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:34,013
It is forbidden to touch that instrument! You must not obey the Doctor! You will kill us all! He intends to create an explosion!

295
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:38,010
Come away from those instruments! You will destroy the Colony!

296
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,414
Oh, shut up. Okay, Doctor. Fire away.

297
00:20:40,662 --> 00:20:43,280
Guards! Stop the stranger!

298
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:46,479
Switch on both inflow and outflow.

299
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:52,988
No! Stop! The pressure will be unbearable! Oh, the human beings as well...

300
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,022
Switch them on, Ben. Then stand by to throw the lever.

301
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:58,743
You are to give no such order!

302
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:03,690
Inflow on. Outflow on. Okay, Doc. Ready with the lever.

303
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:06,427
Quickly, Doctor!

304
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:10,448
Throw the lever away from you.

305
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:14,492
No! No! Don't let him.

306
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:20,778
No!

307
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:58,512
My first duty is to thank the strangers, for they have saved our Colony.

308
00:22:01,011 --> 00:22:06,767
A dance festival will be held every year in their memory, and the winners will be awarded the Strangers' Trophy.

309
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,834
Where's the Doctor?

310
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:10,367
Why, he's right over there.

311
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:11,758
Well, I've got a tip-off he'll wanna hear.

312
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,255
Hey, Doctor? Doctor?

313
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,974
Relax. Relax. More haste, more waste. Pleasure is beautiful.

314
00:22:18,198 --> 00:22:20,061
Relax? You wait till you hear what they're going to do with you.

315
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:21,323
Oh, well. Ha, ha, ha.

316
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:25,669
Yeah, I just heard it on the grapevine. They're going to draft us as members of the Colony, and make you the next Pilot.

317
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:29,633
They can't do that to me. Let's get out of here.

318
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,597
Yes, but how?

319
00:22:30,913 --> 00:22:34,116
Take a leaf out of Jamie's book. Give them the old dance routine.
