00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,268
Yes, I thought so. Who was it?
是的, 我也觉得．是谁？

111
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:10,861
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. No person. No.
噢, 不, 不．噢, 不．不是人．不是

111
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:13,861
I simply mean that I took readings from the various dials.
我只是说我从多个仪表盘上采集了数据

112
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:17,681
They appeared to be related, so I worked out
the principle that controls them.
它们看起来是有关联的．所以我推导出来了控制它们的原理

113
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,281
It was simple really. Like doing a sum backwards.
其实很简单, 真的．就像倒着求和一样

114
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:21,422
Backwards?
倒着？

是的．你知道, 就是给定答案, 找出问题

Wipe it away. Get it off there before anybody else sees it.
擦掉吧．从这里下去fixme, 以免有别人看到了

117
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:31,207
Oh, well. If you insist.
噢, 好吧, 你非得坚持的话

118
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:38,979
Ho, ho. There now. If anyone follows that formula, 
there'll be an almighty explosion
呵呵, 看看．如果有人按这个方程式fixme, 就会引发一场巨大的爆炸

119
00:09:39,234 --> 00:09:41,279
x to the power of y is derivative 2 3's of 6!

120
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:42,357
Get it off.

121
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,442
What are they doing?
他们在做什么？

122
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:57,154
We call that probing.
我们管这个叫做探测

123

They're not looking for more gas?

124
00:09:58,953 --> 00:10:00,400
Oh, yes. We never stop!

There's a door here. Where's it lead to?

00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:06,944
I've no idea. To my knowledge, those doors were never opened.
我不知道．据我的了解, 那些门从来没有打开过

127
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,325
Could be an old shaft.
可能是一个旧的竖井

128
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:11,692
Why would it need such a new door? And so strong?

129
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:13,522

130
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:15,529
Ah, you've made the connection?

worse than the Danger Gang, you know.
现在, 小心点, Medok．有些地方比危险组更严重, 你知道吧

133
00:10:22,517 --> 00:10:25,765
This is a high pressure strike.
You are going to need a stronger screw than this.
这是fixme

134
00:10:25,963 --> 00:10:26,677
Don't touch it.
别碰它

135
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:28,207
I know what I'm doing.

Do you think he saw you take the keys?

Well, if he did, we're in trouble.

But where, Jamie. And how?
