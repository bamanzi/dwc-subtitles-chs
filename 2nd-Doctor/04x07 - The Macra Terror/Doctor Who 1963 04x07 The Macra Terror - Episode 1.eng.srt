1
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:26,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:41,399
Oh, splendid! Splendid! You've got a very good band there, Barney.

3
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:42,298
Thank you, Pilot

4
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:47,972
Mind you, I don't say you'll come first at the festival, but never say die, hmm, what? Nothing succeeds like success, ha!

5
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:50,557
"If at first you don't succeed...?"

6
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,147
"... Try, try, try again!"

7
00:01:52,425 --> 00:01:53,170
That's right.

8
00:01:53,422 --> 00:01:54,413
Stop him! Don't let him get out!

9
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:55,516
What's the matter?

10
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:56,281
Medok!

11
00:01:56,447 --> 00:01:57,145
Let me go!

12
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,072
Medok! This is very foolish of you Medok. It's for your own good.

13
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,899
Out of my way!

14
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:05,023
He's far too dangerous to be allowed to escape.

15
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:08,616
Get after him! You should have stopped him!

16
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,632
What happened, Ola?

17
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:13,013
He refused treatment in front of my guards, so I dismissed them and he made a dash for it.

18
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:14,381
Well get after him.

19
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:16,217
He must not get away!

20
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,417
Hey!

21
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,353
Oh! Oh, Ben! For goodness sake!

22
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:55,260
Well, what's the big stick for Jamie? Nothing's happened yet.

23
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,923
Have you no sense? Have you forgot what we saw on that time scanner?

24
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:00,252
Don't, it was horrible.

25
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:03,466
Aye, well, I'll not being left without nothing to defend ourselves with.

26
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:05,217
I'm afraid you're wasting your time, Jamie.

27
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:06,082
Why?

28
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:12,671
Unless I'm very much mistaken, these creatures are so big they're going to see us long before we see them.

29
00:04:13,142 --> 00:04:13,856
Look out Jamie!

30
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:15,777
Hang on, mate, I'll get him!

31
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:19,511
Ben!

32
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,151
Sit on top of him!

33
00:04:23,725 --> 00:04:24,612
What are you doing?_!

34
00:04:25,754 --> 00:04:26,904
Ben, are you all right?

35
00:04:33,777 --> 00:04:40,365
We don't know who you are, strangers, but we are grateful. Medok is one of our last patients in the Colony.

36
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:45,240
We've done our best for him but he gets worse day by day...

37
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:52,340
I wasn't informed you were travelling across our territory.

38
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:57,322
Hurry back to the Colony and tell the Pilot what's happened.

39
00:04:58,045 --> 00:04:58,974
Pilot?

40
00:04:59,388 --> 00:05:04,415
Yes, the Pilot of our colony. No doubt he will want to thank you in person.

41
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:11,260
Tie him up tighter. Come on, tighter! I don't want any more trouble with him. Come on, I'll show you myself. Get out of...

42
00:05:12,574 --> 00:05:16,053
Er, uh, any good asking where we are?

43
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:22,860
Well, according to my calculations we're, er, certainly in the future and, er, on a planet very like the Earth.

44
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:24,124
How do you know?

45
00:05:24,386 --> 00:05:26,608
I don't know. I'm guessing.

46
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:29,981
My name is Ola. I am the Chief of Police.

47
00:05:30,212 --> 00:05:31,569
That sounds very important.

48
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:43,465
Oh, it's a very responsible job. I take my instructions from our Control centre. Oh, it all works very well, as you will see. Please follow me.

49
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:45,020
Oh, thank you.

50
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:52,730
Ah, not too tight ?it's bad for the blood pressure.

51
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:57,501
"Run, run, run, run...

52
00:05:57,856 --> 00:05:58,210
Run, run, run, run!

53
00:05:59,114 --> 00:06:00,190
Thank you shift...

54
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,793
Thank you shift...

55
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:03,400
Number one!

56
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,184
Pilot, these are the strangers that have helped us.

57
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:15,010
Very well, Ola. I will look after our guests. You will no doubt wish to take care of poor Medok. You may leave.

58
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:22,451
Well, our thanks to you and welcome! You are indeed a brave man to tackle someone as disturbed as Medok.

59
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,772
Well, it was nothing. Anyone would have done the same. Well this is gay! Why all the music?

60
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:30,765
Oh, we regulate our day by music.

61
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:31,752
Oh.

62
00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:32,621
Yes...

63
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:36,118
...and now my friends, I suggest you take advantage of our refreshing department.

64
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,955
Oh, lead me to it mate. I'm starving.

65
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:41,309
Oh, you will eat later. Here we revive the weary body.

66
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:42,584
Oh.

67
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:44,487
Keep your eyes skinned.

68
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,670
Why? What's the matter?

69
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:48,528
Well, they're a weird sort of folk. I don't know that I understand them.

70
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:56,479
Come along in, my friends, It's just through _ there.

71
00:06:57,246 --> 00:07:01,168
Pilot! Pilot! Control wish you to call them immediately. They wish to welcome our guests.

72
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:02,280
Oh, but of course.

73
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:03,736
Switch on please, my dear.

74
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:10,019
Hey, who's that? He looks smashing.

75
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,515
That's our Controller.

76
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:31,293
We wish to welcome joyfully the visitors to our colony. We are very grateful to them. They have performed a valuable service. The Colony is to make our guests happy and contented during their stay. Welcome again, friends. Now, back to work, everyone!

77
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,749
Well that's great! I'm really going to enjoy myself.

78
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:39,156
Splendid! And now my good friends, let me put you into the hands of our supervisor, Barney.

79
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:41,327
Dear old Barney, everybody calls him.

80
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:42,405
Well, thank you Pilot.

81
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,697
And I must leave you for... work calls you know, and hard work never hurt anybody.

82
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:47,610
Till later!

83
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:59,091
Delighted to see you. Delighted to have you with us. Now you have a complete choice of all our treatments. We have steam baths, beauty treatments, perhaps a massage. You sir, of course, would like your clothes cleaned.

84
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:03,507
And there's sunlight treatment, moonlight treatment, sparkling and effervescent sprays...

85
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:05,428
I feel perfectly all right as I am, thank you.

86
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:10,389
Ah, go on Doctor. Don't be such a drag. It all looks super. Please, may I have a shampoo?

87
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:12,032
Shampoo, of course, for the young lady.

88
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:12,994
Thanks very much.

89
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:16,593
And for the young gentlemen, our very latest treatment in our cubicles over there.

90
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:21,502
Me? Oh, hey, you're not going to do that to me. I'm no lassie.

91
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:26,099
It's no good, Jamie, the lassies have got you! And believe me mate, I'm not going to struggle.

92
00:08:26,566 --> 00:08:29,210
And now sir, for you...

93
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:40,503
Oh, very nice. Very nice indeed. You must certainly be the most beautiful young lady in our Colony and are quite sure to be elected our next beauty president.

94
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:41,856
Thank you very much.

95
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,504
Oh, not at all. It's all part of our service.

96
00:08:48,888 --> 00:08:49,822
To your liking sir?

97
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:52,322
Ah, marvellous. Like being at anchor in the Med.

98
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:55,614
Some protective oils for our guests and a little suntan.

99
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:57,541
Ha ha! This is the life.

100
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:04,388
Hey mister, would you call the ladies off? I'm frightened what they might do to me.

101
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:06,092
But you look charming, sir. Charming.

102
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,921
That's what I'm frightened of.

103
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:17,262
Please get me out of here! I'm done to a turn!

104
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:18,650
Clothes reviver.

105
00:09:18,977 --> 00:09:20,275
My clothes don't need reviving!

106
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:26,937
Oh, while we're about it, sir... and off.

107
00:09:32,848 --> 00:09:35,655
Oh, Doctor. You look gorgeous!

108
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:37,152
Oh, my shoes!

109
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:39,453
Oh, they're fantastic. You can see your face in them.

110
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:42,956
Precisely. Who wants to see their face in a pair of suede shoes?

111
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:44,260
What's this one?

112
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:47,507
Oh, that, sir, is our rough and tumble machine, for toning up the muscles.

113
00:09:47,715 --> 00:09:49,258
Exactly what I need!

114
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:50,157
Full on!

115
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:51,506
Oh, but no, sir! No!

116
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:53,034
Turn it off.

117
00:09:53,563 --> 00:09:54,616
Come out of it!

118
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:56,630
Come out of it, Doctor.

119
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:10,938
Oh, oh, I feel better. Oh, that's what I need.

120
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:22,578
Oh, you look smashing. You really do. You look like a prince. Jamie that's super. It really is.

121
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:30,152
Come on, move back! This prisoner's not to be trusted. He's violent and suffering from delusions.

122
00:10:30,478 --> 00:10:38,034
I'm not the one suffering from delusions, it's you! All of you! You don't know what's happening in this Colony!

123
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:39,125
Be quiet Medok!

124
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:41,057
There's only one way to silence me, Ola.

125
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:44,689
Medok, old fellow, it's Questa. Remember me? What's happened to you?

126
00:10:44,872 --> 00:10:46,724
It's no good. You can't reason with him.

127
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:49,008
Just a minute. He's an old friend. One of the best.

128
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,703
Ha!

129
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:55,322
He's as cheerful as any of us. Medok, what's happened to you? What's all this about you seeing things?

130
00:10:55,731 --> 00:11:04,094
I don't see things Questa, you fool! There are things... horrible things... creatures, infesting this camp at night.

131
00:11:04,304 --> 00:11:08,885
That's enough! Have you seen the Pilot?

132
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,400
He's with the strangers. I've no idea where they are.

133
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:25,641
Back to work! Shift rest is over! No time to be lost! The Colony needs you! Preparation to be made for tonight's reception - a welcome for the strangers!

134
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:30,749
A reception tonight! A Colony party! Medok, join in with the rest of us, like you used to.

135
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:33,160
It will be fun for all!

136
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:34,437
You hear that Medok, fun for all.

137
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:42,036
All right! Have fun while you can, before they crawl all over you!

138
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:44,623
That's enough! Right, get back all of you.

139
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,921
There you are. I wondered what had happened to you.

140
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,335
I don't know you. You don't belong here.

141
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:51,740
Do you belong here?

142
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:54,281
No, not any more.

143
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:57,491
We don't talk to him. He sees things. Come on Medok.

144
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:13,731
Can I help you?

145
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:20,414
What? Oh, no. No, it's all right, thank you. I... I just thought I'd dropped something, that's all.

146
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:37,343
Ha! What's _?

147
00:12:37,898 --> 00:12:39,288
Shh, I'm going to set you free.

148
00:12:40,771 --> 00:12:46,186
Just hold still a minute. There we are. One more.

149
00:12:48,682 --> 00:13:02,531
Don't bother to say thank you. Now, tell me something about these things that you see, hmm? Do they, for instance, appear to crawl slowly over the ground?

150
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:03,697
How do you know?

151
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:05,133
Oh, just wondered that's all.

152
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:07,108
Listen!

153
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,477
I don't hear anything.

154
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:10,846
Someone's coming.

155
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,572
It's all right, I won't let them hurt you.

156
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:13,845
Get out of my way!

157
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:15,062
Why don't you listen to me?

158
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,694
I am not being caught!

159
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:20,348
Stop him! Don't let him escape!

160
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,420
How did he get away? Who's responsible?

161
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:26,775
What happened?

162
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:30,138
I... I told him he wouldn't get hurt and he wouldn't believe me.

163
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:31,534
You mean you let him go?

164
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:33,608
Well, no, not exactly.

165
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:39,726
He let the prisoner escape. That is a crime in this Colony. For that, men must work in the pit. Guard!

166
00:13:39,975 --> 00:13:42,295
You can't touch him. He doesn't know your laws!

167
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:44,523
Er, that's true, Ola. He is a stranger here.

168
00:13:44,672 --> 00:13:48,883
There's something else you're forgetting gentlemen - I set free someone that we caught in the first place.

169
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:50,937
True - a reasonable point of view, Ola.

170
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:57,538
Medok is dangerous. He should have never let him go. The Colony will be petrified when they know he's out there in the night.

171
00:13:57,689 --> 00:13:59,860
Well, send your patrol after him. He can't have got far.

172
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:03,882
He can run you know. He's got legs. He doesn't have to crawl over the ground.

173
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:05,184
Why did you say that?

174
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:07,649
Why, no reason. No reason at all.

175
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:13,695
Anyone who spreads that kind of rumour in this Colony will find himself in the hospital for correction.

176
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:16,879
Oh... oh, that's where Medok is, is it?

177
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,937
I think, Doctor, you will understand more about Medok if you talk to some of the people who knew him best.

178
00:14:22,099 --> 00:14:22,745
Pilot, I think...

179
00:14:22,918 --> 00:14:28,215
Now take the strangers to the labour centre Ola. See they learn something about us. Please, go with him.

180
00:14:28,388 --> 00:14:29,574
Oh, well thank you.

181
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:49,861
What is it?

182
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:50,973
Nothing, come on.

183
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:27,132
This is your Controller speaking. There is no need for alarm. You may all continue your work and play, confident that the best is being done for you. But our unfortunate companion Medok has been allowed to escape. Emergency Patrols two and three are now searching the Colony and he is sure to be caught before it is dark. Now return to your work and play with fresh heart and renewed energy!

184
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:30,897
They got that bloke all over the place like a blinking politician.

185
00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:35,006
He is our controller. We are always pleased to see him. He brings us encouragement.

186
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:36,357
Oh, he's not a politician then!

187
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:43,892
Number nine shift to stand by. Leader to report to Youth Centre.

188
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:45,571
Work shift ready to leave.

189
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,865
"We're happy to work,

190
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:48,549
Happy to play,

191
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:50,123
That's a nice wee tune Doctor.

192
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,553
Yeah, if you happen to like work.

193
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:53,802
It's a privilege to work for the Colony.

194
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,571
Shift leader reporting: Shift number nine, all present and correct.

195
00:15:56,743 --> 00:15:58,739
Good. You're the first of the night shift.

196
00:15:59,101 --> 00:16:02,544
Uh, what do ye do then? Farming or fishing?

197
00:16:03,513 --> 00:16:05,064
We work very hard here.

198
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,726
Yes, but what do you do?

199
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,616
We tap and refine gas.

200
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:12,710
For heating?

201
00:16:13,157 --> 00:16:17,635
No, we use it for many things. The Colony depends on it. It's absolutely essen...

202
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:21,231
Emergency! Quick, give me that! Come on!

203
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:25,926
Accident! Stand by, oxygen supply. Take them away. Any other losses?

204
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:27,629
Two with gas sickness. Come on.

205
00:16:27,935 --> 00:16:29,051
What happened?

206
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:32,244
Their work. It can't be helped. The work must be done.

207
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:35,070
Do you hear that, Doctor?

208
00:16:35,672 --> 00:16:37,001
Where's he gone?

209
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:46,359
Shh! I saw you.

210
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:47,331
Get out!

211
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:52,550
Oh, that's not very polite. I was interested in what you were saying.

212
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:54,075
Who else knows I'm here?

213
00:16:54,354 --> 00:17:03,657
No one. Why should I tell them? Now these creatures - have you seen them clearly? What do they look like?

214
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,974
What has it to do with you?

215
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:07,839
Well, I'm interested. What do they look like?

216
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:22,829
All right. If you really want to know. It's hard to say. They move at night, in the dark. And look horrible. Creatures... like giant insects.

217
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:25,040
With big claws?

218
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,434
Yes, that's it.

219
00:17:27,456 --> 00:17:28,854
You've seen them in the Colony?

220
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:29,800
Oh yes.

221
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:31,683
Has anyone else seen them?

222
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:36,130
A few, but they've lock them up in the correction hospital.

223
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,807
Why do they do that?

224
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:40,949
Control tells them to. They'll put me back there when they catch me.

225
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,991
And they'll put you back there for helping me.

226
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,747
Doctor! Doctor!

227
00:17:46,913 --> 00:17:48,464
Go on! Quickly! They're looking for you!

228
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:49,836
Doctor!

229
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:59,283
But we searched there, I'm sure.

230
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:00,338
Aye.

231
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:05,696
Were you looking for me?

232
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:06,776
Where have you been?

233
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:08,270
I'm just looking around, that's all.

234
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:10,626
It's dangerous to go off on your own after dark.

235
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,171
Oh, I'm used to the dark. I like it.

236
00:18:12,397 --> 00:18:20,005
We're confined to rest cubicles at night by order of Control. Anyone who wanders around the Colony at night... may be killed.

237
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:27,906
Curfew time. All personnel not on duty must retire to quarters.

238
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:29,164
Do you hear that?

239
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:41,916
Emergency patrols two and three to remain on duty. Work shifts to remain at their posts until dawn. Visitors to retire for the night to the refreshing department.

240
00:18:42,168 --> 00:18:44,579
That's you. You're confined here.

241
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:49,059
Here we are, Doctor.

242
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:51,339
Your young friends are in their rooms over there.

243
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,352
Thank you.

244
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:55,219
I, er, I hope you sleep well.

245
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:58,341
Oh, I'm sure I will. Thank you. Goodnight.

246
00:18:58,619 --> 00:18:59,464
Goodnight, Doctor.

247
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:40,381
It is now dark. No one will go outside into the Colony. A dangerous man is in hiding. Our patrols have orders to shoot on sight. Happy sleep time everybody.

248
00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:42,279
And the same to you!

249
00:21:14,585 --> 00:21:15,606
I'll have a look over there.

250
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:18,048
It's all right. It's me. Stay where you are.

251
00:21:19,193 --> 00:21:19,862
Why are you back?

252
00:21:20,234 --> 00:21:20,875
Don't move.

253
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,464
Have a look in those new houses they're building.

254
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,927
He's coming! We'll have to get out!

255
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:28,826
Wait! If he comes in this way, we'll go out the back. If he comes in the back, we'll go out here.

256
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:32,518
He's coming... to the front of the house.

257
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:35,413
Over here. I heard something.

258
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:37,940
All right. Go back.

259
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,078
You can't stay here.

260
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:40,431
I'll try to create a diversion.

261
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:41,291
No, they'll kill you!

262
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,381
Do as I tell you.

263
00:21:43,742 --> 00:21:44,865
Thanks.

264
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:47,001
Go on. Go on.

265
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,652
All right, we'll go through this opening when I give the word.

266
00:21:59,706 --> 00:22:01,040
Right. Now!

267
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,312
No, look. Out there.

268
00:22:04,938 --> 00:22:05,775
I don't see anything.

269
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:10,213
In that patch of moonlight. I told you I'd seen them!
