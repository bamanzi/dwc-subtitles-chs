1
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:28,237
Right. Now!

2
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:31,748
No. Look out there.

3
00:00:32,478 --> 00:00:33,376
I don't see anything.

4
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:37,408
In that patch of moonlight.
I told you I'd seen them!

5
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,600
<b>The Macra Terror</b>
(2019 Animated version. Episode 2)

1
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:42,300
(Sincro: bamanzi)

6
00:00:54,337 --> 00:00:57,995
Ah! That proves it!
I wasn't seeing things!

7
00:00:58,431 --> 00:00:59,783
Medok - the guards. They'll hear you.

8
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:02,199
It doesn't matter.
They can't lock me up again.

9
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:04,599
Now I can prove it. We know they're real.

10
00:01:04,783 --> 00:01:05,621
Medok.

11
00:01:05,884 --> 00:01:09,504
Medok. I know you're in there.
Come out quietly.

12
00:01:10,092 --> 00:01:12,114
You can put that gun away. I'm coming.

13
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,725
- Who's with you?  - The Doctor.

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,844
- What are you doing here?
- Don't waste time.

15
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,273
- Come on over here.
- Stay where you are.

16
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,456
- Listen, I came out to show you.
- Stand still!

17
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:20,898
It's the Macra, Ola! They are real!

18
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:22,298
Ask the Doctor. He'll tell you.

19
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:23,914
Yes, I think I can confirm...

20
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:26,235
We don't want to know
what the strangers think.

21
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,118
Well, it might be as well to...

22
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:31,454
Ha, ha, ha. Where do you think
you're going?

23
00:01:31,694 --> 00:01:32,744
I just thought I'd go and have a look.

24
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:35,048
Stay where you are. Guards - search him.

25
00:01:38,373 --> 00:01:39,743
What will they do to us?

26
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:43,884
I'll tell you.
You're going before the Pilot.

27
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:46,484
You are in the company
of an escaped criminal.

28
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:51,284
And you were out in the Colony at night.

29
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:54,132
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I thought he'd listen to reason.

30
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:57,287
Reason's the last thing
a man like Ola will listen to.

31
00:01:57,775 --> 00:02:00,197
You're going to be in trouble,
and it's my fault.

32
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:05,271
Silence! Pilot's headquarters. Move!

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,614
...all of our shifts to stand by
for greater efforts during working hours.

34
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,314
The gas from the pits must
be kept in constant supply

35
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,014
...at even greater pressures.

36
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,214
Remember the life of the colony
is dependent upon this gas.

37
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:21,714
All industry and activity...

38
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:29,835
Emergency call. Emergency call.

39
00:02:30,105 --> 00:02:31,331
Yes. Go ahead, emergency.

40
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:33,958
Ola requests audience immediately.

41
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:36,484
Ola requests audience immediately.

42
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,272
Look, I'm extremely busy.
Unless this is a major crisis, I really don't...

43
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:41,283
Medok has been taken prisoner

44
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,284
and one of the strangers
has been captured with him.

45
00:02:44,737 --> 00:02:45,881
Bring the stranger in.

46
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:49,943
Good evening, Pilot.

47
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,343
Oh, what a very nice office
you have here.

48
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,769
Now what's this all about, Doctor?

49
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:54,807
Well, I...

50
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:57,186
We found both of them
in the new buildings, Pilot.

51
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,791
At night? How did he get there?

52
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,791
Wasn't there a guard
on his sleeping quarters?

53
00:03:00,302 --> 00:03:02,096
All my guards were out
looking for Medok, Pilot.

54
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:04,126
I see. Very well.
You may leave us, Ola.

55
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:06,126
I will conduct the investigation myself.

56
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:10,807
Oh, forgive me. This is interesting,

57
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:14,107
a telescopic viewing machine, hmm?

58
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:18,107
I imagine you can keep track
on the entire Colony from here

59
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:20,307
and direct intercommunication
between all parts.

60
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,407
Hmm. Very up-to-date, I imagine.

61
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:24,107
Excellent, excellent. And what...

62
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:26,906
You don't seem to realize
how serious this business is, Doctor.

63
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:28,646
You have committed a crime.

64
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,213
A crime?

65
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:33,316
What were you doing with Medok?
You know he's a dangerous man.

66
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,401
I'm not so sure, Pilot.

67
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,330
You have already been told.

68
00:03:37,621 --> 00:03:39,832
He has refused
to cooperate and to obey orders.

69
00:03:39,921 --> 00:03:41,532
He suffers from hallucinations.

70
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:44,549
Ah, that's the point. Does he?

71
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:46,684
And what exactly do you mean by that?

72
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:49,558
Let me perhaps explain.

73
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,034
Well, what is it now? I've already said
that I don't want to be interrupted.

74
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:57,358
Ola reporting, Pilot.

75
00:03:57,652 --> 00:03:58,635
Well, what is it?

76
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,124
Medok has made a statement.
It completely changes the situation.

77
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:03,627
Oh, very well. Bring him in.

78
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:08,140
I hope you are not going to listen to
everything that Medok tells you?

79
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:11,189
Why, Doctor? Are you afraid of something he might say?

80
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:13,430
Well, in his state of mind
he might say anything.

81
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,514
Doctor. How have they been treating you?

82
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:20,604
- Silence!
- Perfectly all right, thank you.

83
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:23,763
Medok's made a further statement, Pilot.
It's about the Doctor.

84
00:04:23,993 --> 00:04:25,395
- Ah. - Aha!

85
00:04:25,486 --> 00:04:27,569
- Yes, Medok?
- The Doctor wasn't helping me.

86
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:29,810
He was trying to make me give myself up.

87
00:04:31,232 --> 00:04:34,434
Well, that was extremely brave.
Why didn't you tell us this?

88
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:36,218
Well, as a matter of fact...

89
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,481
Captain Ola didn't give him a chance.

90
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:42,262
I see. Well, it seems
we owe you an apology, Doctor.

91
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,328
It's better we tell the truth, Doctor.

92
00:04:45,593 --> 00:04:49,656
Yes. Thank you Medok.
I... I quite understand.

93
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:50,679
Take him away.

94
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:51,958
Come on Medok.

95
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:54,797
Well, I'm extremely sorry about it, Doctor,

96
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:56,797
and of course you're free to go.

97
00:04:58,034 --> 00:04:59,523
What will happen to Medok?

98
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:02,553
Oh. Well, he'll be taken back
to the hospital for correction.

99
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:04,353
He'll be given
another course of treatment.

100
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:08,053
And when he returns to the Colony,
Medok will be a changed man.

101
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:09,503
He will cooperate and he will obey orders.

102
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:11,653
He'll be just like the rest of us.

103
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:14,006
Why do you want everyone to be the same?

104
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:18,960
Doctor, this colony was founded
many centuries ago by our ancestors

105
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,190
who came from the Earth planet,
like your young friends.

106
00:05:22,429 --> 00:05:25,290
Our ancestors believed in
the virtues of healthy happiness

107
00:05:25,429 --> 00:05:28,290
and we have tried
to keep their ideals alive.

108
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:32,290
Sometimes, alas,
it is necessary to use force.

109
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,642
The Doctor will be returning
to his quarters now.

110
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:39,816
The Doctor's escort is ready.

111
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,495
Well, I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Doctor,

112
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,495
and many thanks again for your help.

113
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,130
Not at all. Thank you. Goodnight.

114
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,496
Oh, I'm so sorry.

115
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:53,652
Goodnight.

116
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:08,648
The Doctor and his friends are to be given...

117
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:12,648
the advantage of high powered adaption at once.

118
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:15,548
They must begin to think like
members of the Colony.

119
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:18,548
They are to have deep sleep
and thinking patterns.

120
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:21,648
We cannot have criticism
from these strangers!

121
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:24,548
The work is urgent.
It must begin immediately.

122
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:30,323
Emergency order from Control, top priority.

123
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:31,823
Are all the cubicles connected?

124
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,837
The rest cubicles for the four strangers
are all connected

125
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,137
for deep sleep and thought patterns.

126
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:40,822
Very good. The process
is to begin immediately.

127
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:42,122
Your instructions are being carried out.

128
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:48,081
That is good. This is an emergency.

129
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:50,881
Control must be believed and obeyed!

130
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:54,381
No one on the Colony believes in Macra!

131
00:06:54,683 --> 00:06:58,281
There is no such thing as Macra!

132
00:06:58,453 --> 00:07:02,781
Macra do not exist!
There are no Macra!

133
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:16,580
The sleeper must relax

134
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:27,960
and believe everything in the Colony
is good and beautiful.

135
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:31,710
You must accept it without question.

136
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:38,460
You must obey orders.

137
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:44,060
The leaders of the Colony
know what is best.

138
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:58,360
In the morning when you wake up
you will be given some work.

139
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:01,260
You will be glad to obey.

140
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,583
You will question nothing in the Colony.

141
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:29,988
Ben? Ben!

142
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:32,867
Huh? What is it?

143
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,446
I heard something.

144
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,938
Oh, you're always hearing something.

145
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:40,216
I never heard a voice like this before.

146
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:47,086
- Ben?  - I'm asleep.

147
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:52,490
It was evil, Ben - an evil voice

148
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:55,740
An evil that spoke so gently and yet...

149
00:08:55,863 --> 00:08:58,640
yet I almost believed what it said.

150
00:08:58,694 --> 00:08:59,667
Oh, look, mate. Get some sleep.

151
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:02,767
We got a hard day's work
ahead of us tomorrow.

152
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:05,728
Why do you say that?

153
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:08,712
Well, we've got to do something
to help in the Colony.

154
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:11,712
We can't just eat their nosh
without helping out.

155
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:14,146
You sound just like that voice, Ben.

156
00:09:14,598 --> 00:09:17,595
Oh, what are you on about?
This colony's all right.

157
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:20,595
It won't be too bad to work here.

158
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:24,653
I never heard you
talk that way before, Ben.

159
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:51,531
You will not resist the sleeping gas.
Breathe deeply.

160
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:59,931
In the morning, when you wake,
you will obey.

161
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,405
Wake up, Polly.

162
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:23,982
Doctor? What on earth are you doing?

163
00:10:24,226 --> 00:10:27,154
I've been scotching a rumour.
Or should I say, scorching.

164
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,679
What happened?

165
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:33,246
Polly, I think you've been listening
to some very bad advice.

166
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,925
But I've been asleep.

167
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:38,610
Yes, I know you have.
Fast asleep. Very fast asleep.

168
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:44,610
Polly, do you smell anything?
A sort of sweet perfume?

169
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:46,996
- No.  - Never mind.

170
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:52,230
Polly, I want you to forget
everything that you've been dreaming.

171
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:53,868
Why do you say that?

172
00:10:54,085 --> 00:10:56,814
Well, it's just possible that
you've been given a series of orders

173
00:10:56,885 --> 00:10:57,614
...while you've been asleep.

174
00:10:57,685 --> 00:11:00,414
You know, do this, do that,
do the other thing.

175
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:03,334
My advice to you is
don't do anything of the sort.

176
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:06,914
Don't just be obedient.
Always make up your own mind.

177
00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:09,114
What am I thinking of? Ben and Jamie!

178
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:15,670
Hello, Doctor. Is it morning?

179
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:18,135
No, not yet. Nearly so.

180
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:21,514
- What are you up to?
- Well, by my calculations...

181
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:25,467
there should be a thin strand of wire
in the wall here,

182
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:28,467
like a nerve tapping
the subconscious of the human brain.

183
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:31,461
Lay off, mate.
You'll find yourself on a charge.

184
00:11:32,298 --> 00:11:36,121
- Should be here somewhere. Ah!
- Pack it in, Doctor

185
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:38,190
The way you mess about,
you could do some damage.

186
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:40,446
Better some damage than
loss of will power.

187
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:43,308
What are you on about? Look,
get out of it. It's against the law.

188
00:11:44,257 --> 00:11:46,701
- What law?!
- The law of the Colony.

189
00:11:49,202 --> 00:11:50,742
Don't do that!

190
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:54,163
Now you'll get chucked in jail.

191
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:57,209
What's the matter with you, Ben?
Since when did you start to worry?

192
00:11:57,558 --> 00:11:59,987
He thinks he knows best all the time,
but this time he's wrong.

193
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:01,624
Hey, what's all the noise?

194
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,756
Jamie, how did you sleep?

195
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,506
Oh, very badly, Doctor.
I told Ben I kept hearing wee voices.

196
00:12:07,897 --> 00:12:08,950
That's a good sign.

197
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:12,050
That means they haven't been able
to get very deeply into your brain.

198
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:14,846
- Eh? I don't understand?
- I'll show you. Watch this.

199
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:21,236
You're fools, all of you!
Just look what you've done!

200
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:22,836
You've smashed up all this equipment!

201
00:12:23,023 --> 00:12:25,030
Yes, but look here. If they were
trying to make us believe ...

202
00:12:25,123 --> 00:12:28,939
- a whole load of rubbish
- Rubbish? It's not rubbish.

203
00:12:31,063 --> 00:12:32,739
Control knows what's best for us.

204
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:35,539
They want us to cooperate.
We should be helping.

205
00:12:36,032 --> 00:12:39,335
What's the matter with you Ben?
This doesn't sound like you at all.

206
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:41,269
We should learn to obey.

207
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:43,690
The Doctor's causing trouble.
I'm going to turn him in.

208
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,066
You don't know what you're doing, Ben.

209
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:46,592
- Get off me!
- What's the matter with him?

210
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:47,879
I'm very much afraid I'm too late.

211
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:49,521
- Ben!  - Let go of me.

212
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:51,785
- Ben!  - Guards! Guards!

213
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:54,268
- No, it's no use, Jamie.
- But we cannot let him go, Doctor.

214
00:12:54,464 --> 00:12:56,959
You'll have to.
Violence will get you nowhere.

215
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:00,708
Doctor, he's going to go and tell the guards.

216
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:01,898
We've got to get you out of here.

217
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:03,151
We can't leave Ben.

218
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:04,343
But he betrayed you.

219
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:07,643
No, no. Not Ben.
He's not in control of his actions.

220
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:10,943
He's been given a series of instructions
and he can't help himself.

221
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,793
- Yes but Doctor...  - That's Him!

222
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:16,284
He prodded about in the wall
and smashed up our equipment.

223
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:20,892
This time we've got the evidence,
and from one of your own friends.

224
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:22,917
- Come on, Doctor.
- Leave him alone.

225
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:24,634
Get out of my way. That's an order.

226
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:26,662
I take orders from no one but the Doctor.

227
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:29,607
All right, you're coming too.
Get out, both of you!

228
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:32,082
Thank you, Jamie,
but I'd better go with Captain Ola.

229
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:34,345
But Doctor, what will they do to you?

230
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:37,900
He should be in that hospital of yours.

231
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,176
You traitor. You...

232
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:40,189
That's enough!

233
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:51,079
The hospital. He needs correction
more than Medok does.

234
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:58,676
It's a very difficult case, I'm afraid.

235
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:02,176
Nothing much we can do.
He's too far gone to help.

236
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:05,176
No, he'll never be happy like the rest of us.

237
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:09,876
All we can do is send him
to the pits for life.

238
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:15,527
Can't hide the truth.

239
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:21,044
Yes, what is it?

240
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:23,644
What's that? The Doctor?

241
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:26,544
I'll come at once. Keep at it.

242
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,600
Better. Better

243
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:37,222
What did you do it for?
The Doctor's our friend.

244
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:39,027
I had to do my duty.

245
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:41,354
Well, you go on doing it, then.

246
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:43,354
I'm going to go and find out
where the others have gone.

247
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:44,714
Look, Polly, you'd better stay here.

248
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:45,917
Go on, report me.

249
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:47,269
Now look. Come back, Polly.

250
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:49,219
Polly! Polly!

251
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,799
Polly, where are you?

252
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,899
Polly?

253
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,799
You'll be in trouble.

254
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,790
Don't fool about, Polly.
You must obey Control.

255
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:31,977
Polly?

256
00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:57,063
Stop!

257
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,982
Leave me alone.

258
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,504
You're coming back to the guard.

259
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,762
What's the matter with you, Ben?
Wake up!

260
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:07,032
You're coming with me, girl.
You broke the Colony law!

261
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:12,766
What's the matter with you?

262
00:16:15,878 --> 00:16:17,184
There's nothing there.

263
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:23,492
But, there was! I saw it!

264
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:31,092
A huge face, like an insect,
or a giant crab.

265
00:16:31,195 --> 00:16:34,002
It was horrible
and it was looking at us and...

266
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,502
and... and it had claws.

267
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,292
Claws like we saw on the time scanner.

268
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:42,059
- There's nothing there. Come on.
- No, not that way.

269
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:44,558
- Look you're just trying to dodge off.
- No, no. Please no. I'm not, but...

270
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:47,930
- But please look.
- There is nothing there!

271
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:48,776
Ben.

272
00:16:53,776 --> 00:16:54,780
What is it?

273
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,116
I... I don't know.

274
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,318
Well, what are we going to do?

275
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:02,427
There is nothing evil
or harmful in this colony.

276
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:04,556
How can you believe that, studge?

277
00:17:04,743 --> 00:17:07,857
It stands to reason. It's safe.
There is nothing here!

278
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:15,706
Ben, what is this? Get it off me!

279
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:17,906
Get it off me, Ben!

280
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,650
It's got my foot!

281
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,500
Ben!

282
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,100
Ben, help!

283
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Help me, Ben! Help me!

284
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,700
Help me!

285
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,900
Oh! Ben!

286
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:43,479
Oh, it was horrible!

287
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:46,127
It's all right. I think it's going away.

288
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,450
Let go inside.

289
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:15,605
Ben, behind you!

290
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:18,755
There's another one!

291
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,145
Ahh! Ben, they're all around us!

292
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:25,840
Polly, you make a run for it,
and I'll keep them here.

293
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:27,565
No, you won't stand a chance.

294
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:30,354
We can't stop here. Come on, quick!

295
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:38,944
Ahh!

296
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:42,289
You have destroyed
three nerve circuits, Doctor.

297
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,689
You have burned them out.
What have you to say?

298
00:18:45,605 --> 00:18:47,866
Rather neat, don't you think?

299
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:50,466
And so simple. I did it with this.

300
00:18:50,536 --> 00:18:52,295
- You admit it?  - I'm proud of it.

301
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:56,330
What is it? What's the matter?

302
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:00,464
My dear Pilot, your wall?

303
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:03,584
Even you were subjected to
this form of subconscious control?

304
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:04,707
Leave that alone.

305
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:05,867
That's better.

306
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:07,511
You will be punished for this.

307
00:19:07,706 --> 00:19:09,065
The least you can do is to say thank you.

308
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:11,039
- Pilot!  - What is it?

309
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,640
It's the young man
who reported the Doctor, Pilot.

310
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,844
What about him?

311
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:16,982
He has another report, Pilot.
An urgent one.

312
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,940
Very well, Ola, you may leave.
I will deal with it.

313
00:19:19,237 --> 00:19:20,855
Who are you stabbing
in the back this time?

314
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:22,355
Polly? Polly? What's the matter?

315
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:27,908
Doctor, it was horrible.
A great insect, like...like a crab.

316
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:30,748
It got hold of me. Ben got me free.

317
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,511
- Ben did?
- And he was nearly killed himself.

318
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:37,045
Silence. Did you protect the girl
from such creatures?

319
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:39,983
She ran away. I went after her.

320
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:44,375
Did you protect her,
and were there such creatures?

321
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,461
No. There were no such creatures.

322
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:48,714
Ben!

323
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:50,246
There are no such things as Macra.

324
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:51,375
But you saw them!

325
00:19:51,575 --> 00:19:54,191
There were no such creatures!
There are no such things as Macra!

326
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:55,848
Don't blame him, Polly.

327
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,933
- But you heard him.  - I told you.

328
00:19:58,347 --> 00:19:59,786
Ben has come under control

329
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:01,986
of the evil forces
at the heart of this colony.

330
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:04,744
That is quite untrue.
Control always acts for the best.

331
00:20:05,198 --> 00:20:06,322
Who is Control?

332
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:08,959
You've seen our Controller.

333
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:10,697
Have I? I don't remember.

334
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,291
Well switch on then.
We've nothing to hide.

335
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:21,258
Controller speaking.
We know everything that's happened.

336
00:20:21,343 --> 00:20:23,708
The poor girl has had hallucinations.

337
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,169
That's not the Controller.
That's just a picture of a man.

338
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,098
It is a picture of our Controller.

339
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:30,244
Well, where is he?
I'll wager he doesn't exist.

340
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:32,276
- Of course he does.
- Well, let's see him then.

341
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:34,576
- That's not necessary.
- Well, I don't believe he's there.

342
00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:35,755
Of course he is, you've heard his voice.

343
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,376
Why don't you show him to us then?

344
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,925
Well all right. If you wish, I'll ask.

345
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:44,405
Ah, as you can hear, Control, they...

346
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,925
they ask to see you in person.

347
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,222
That set the cat among the pigeons.

348
00:20:50,393 --> 00:20:51,342
They've not got him there.

349
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:57,464
This is your Controller.
This is your Controller.

350
00:20:57,732 --> 00:20:58,756
But he's an old man.

351
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:00,350
Well, now you've seen the Controller.

352
00:21:03,314 --> 00:21:04,417
Well let him speak.

353
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:07,096
Be silent! That is an order!

354
00:21:07,338 --> 00:21:08,154
Let him speak.

355
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:09,263
Be silent!

356
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:11,189
Ah, he's not giving the orders.

357
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:12,784
- He can't talk.
- This is the man.

358
00:21:12,978 --> 00:21:14,784
You will hear him speak.

359
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:17,384
Speak, Controller, speak!

360
00:21:18,053 --> 00:21:20,629
Speak? Am I to speak?

361
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,004
Tell the strangers to believe and obey!

362
00:21:25,557 --> 00:21:29,903
I... I will tell them.

363
00:21:30,307 --> 00:21:32,383
I will tell them
I... I'll do what you say.

364
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:50,683
Keep away. Don't touch me. I'll obey.

365
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:52,197
What's that? What's happening!

366
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:55,346
Doctor, that was it -
that thing in the picture!

367
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,746
That was the claw! They're in control!

368
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,338
Take them out of here.
They are condemned to the pits!

369
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,325
- Macra!  - Take them away!

370
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:04,888
They're in control!

371
01:14:00,516 --> 01:14:02,900
<i>(You wish to cooperate. You have seen no strange creatures.)</i>

372
01:14:04,916 --> 01:14:06,900
You will work hard and happily. Hard and happily.
