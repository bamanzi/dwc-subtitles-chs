to help in the Colony.

Doctor? What on earth are you doing?
博士? 你到底在做什么啊?

Hello, Doctor. Is it morning?

- Well, by my calculations...

there should be a thin strand of wire
in the wall here,

like a nerve tapping
the subconscious of the human brain.

Lay off, mate.

停手, 老兄. 你会面临指控的

- 应该在这里某处, 哈!   - 装回去, 博士

The way you mess about,
you could do some damage.
你这样乱来, 会损坏东西的

188
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:40,446
Better some damage than
loss of will power.
损坏一点东西好过意志力丧失

189
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:43,308
What are you on about? Look,
get out of it. It's against the law.

Since when did you start to worry?
你怎么回事, Ben? 你从什么时候开始学会担心了?

I told Ben I kept hearing wee voices.
哦, 非常差, 博士. 我跟 Ben 说过我一直听到有人轻声说活

That's a good sign.
这是个好信号

199
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:12,050
That means they haven't been able
to get very deeply into your brain.

trying to make us believe ...
是的, 但看看这里. 如果他们试图要让我们相信...

- Rubbish? It's not rubbish.

Control knows what's best for us.

more than Medok does.

There is nothing evil
or harmful in this colony.

How can you believe that, studge?
你怎么还相信那个呢?

279
00:17:04,743 --> 00:17:07,857
It stands to reason. It's safe.
There is nothing here!
它有道理啊. 这里是安全的. 这里什么也没有!

280
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:15,706
Ben, what is this? Get it off me!

You have destroyed
three nerve circuits, Doctor.
