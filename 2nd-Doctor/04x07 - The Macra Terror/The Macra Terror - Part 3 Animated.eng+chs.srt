in this atmosphere.

It creeps into your lungs.
是这些瓦斯, 到处都是. 它钻进你的肺里去

唔? 哦, 好吧, 行. 我觉得这样行

I wouldn't know what to do.
啊, 不, 你待在上面. 我不知道该做些什么

72
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,817
Well, I'm not sure I understand
all this machinery myself.
而且, 我不确定自己能否搞懂这些机器什么的

73
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:27,130
Do you not think you might make
better use of the opportunity, Doctor?

Come on you two.

with masks, aren't you?
噢, 你会给他们派发面罩吧, 会吗?

00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,451
You aren't taking them down there
without any protection?

81
00:03:43,972 --> 00:03:46,144
Surely you could have seen to that?
想必你可以搞定那个?

82
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:53,544
Oh, ah, here. You'd better take this,
um... this checklist.

It wasn't your fault
you betrayed your friends.
你背叛了你的朋友并不是你的错

90
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:27,153
The voices tell me what to do.
那些声音告诉我该做什么

91
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:29,907
The voices may not be right, Ben.

You know, Ben, this is very unlike you.

against the voices, isn't it, Ben?
对你来说, 很难同那些声音抗争, 是不是, Ben?

watch out Jamie doesn't catch you.
我警告你, 如果你监视其他人, 小心别让 Jamie 抓到你

Hurry up. Put on your equipment.

The Danger Gang will do as they are told.

It's a punishment for their failure to cooperate.

106
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:24,623
We do all the dirty work.
We go where the gas is worst.
我们干所有的脏活. 我们去瓦斯最严重的地方

I prefer Control poisoning my lungs,
to their trying to poison my mind.
我更愿意管理员毒害我的肺, 而不是试图毒害我的思想

110

He means they've struck so much gas,
they can't channel it off.
他意思时他们挖掘出很多瓦斯, 不能把它们输送走

When it reaches a certain density,
that alarm bell goes.

- Polly!  - Leave her.

What's it all for?
这有什么作用?

130
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:48,422
It's a poisonous gas which we mine,
from the bowels of this planet,
我们从这个星球里面挖掘的是一种有毒气体

131
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:50,322
which kills us if we breathe it.
如果我们吸进去, 会害死我们的

132
00:06:50,902 --> 00:06:52,822
No one knows what it's used for.
没人知道它是用来做什么的

133
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:12,953
Yes.
对了

134
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:18,471
Now one must assume that
the relative connection is constant.
现在我必须得假设相对连接是恒定的

135
00:07:18,793 --> 00:07:21,471
Now, let me see.

Oh, you did give me a turn.
哦, 你吓了我一跳

139
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,460
Where did you find it?

140
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,528
What?
什么?

141
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:09,492
The formula.
这个公式

142
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:12,351
In my head. You know.
从我的大脑里

143
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,909
Don't lie. That is a secret known
only to three people in the Colony.
别撒谎. 这是一项秘密, 这个殖民地只有三个人知道

144
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:17,741
And you're one of them?
而你是其中的一个?

145
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,585
Naturally. And you're not asking me to believe
当然. 你不是要我相信...

146
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,885
that in a few moments you have been
able to work out a formula
在顷刻之间你就能够推导出一个公式

147
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:25,885
which it has taken our
combined computers years to perfect?
而这个公式我们是耗费多台电脑数年时间才完善出来的

148
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:27,922
It does seem rather a tall order.
看起来的确是个高阶的

149
00:08:29,053 --> 00:08:31,532
Yes, of course. I know what you've done.
是的, 当然了. 我知道你干了什么

150
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:34,132
You've broken into our secret files,
haven't you?
你偷看了我们的机密文件, 是吧?

151
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:36,237
I wouldn't know how to do that. Take a look.
我不知道怎么干那个. 你看看

152
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:40,555
Well, you must have seen the document.
That's the exact computation.
是了, 你肯定看过文档了, 这个计算过程是完全一样的

153
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:43,189
Really? Huh. In that case...
真的吗? 哈, 这样的话...

154
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:49,892
Do you really mean to say
that you worked that out by yourself?
你真的是想说, 你完全自己推导出来的?

155
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:53,356
Well, I did have a little assistance.
哦, 我的确靠了一点小小的协助

156
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,218
Yes, I thought so. Who was it?
是的, 我也觉得. 是谁?

157
00:08:55,393 --> 00:08:57,811
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. No person. No.
噢, 不, 不. 噢, 不. 不是人. 不是

158
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:00,811
I simply mean that I took readings
from the various dials.
我只是说我从多个仪表盘上采集了数据

159
00:09:00,902 --> 00:09:02,371
They appeared to be related,
它们看起来是有关联的.

160
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:04,631
so I worked out the principle
that controls them.
所以我推导出来了控制它们的原理

161
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,231
It was simple really.
Like doing a sum backwards.
其实很简单, 真的. 就像倒着求和一样

162
00:09:07,637 --> 00:09:09,172
- Backwards?
- Yes. You know...
- 倒着?   - 是的. 你知道...

163
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,012
Given the answer, what's the question?
就是给定答案, 找出问题

164
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,323
Wipe it away. Get it off there
before anybody else sees it.
擦掉吧. 在其他人看到之前, 把它弄掉

165
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:18,157
Oh, well. If you insist.
噢, 好吧, 你非得坚持的话

166
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:22,856
Ho, ho. There now.
喔呵呵, 看看

167
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:25,929
If anyone follows that formula,
there'll be an almighty explosion
如果有人按这个公式走, 就能引发一场巨大的爆炸

168
00:09:26,184 --> 00:09:28,229
x to the power of y is derivative 2 3's of 6!
y 的 x 次幂是导数的 2 3 得 6!

169
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:29,507
Get it off.
擦掉它

170
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:42,392
What are they doing?
他们在做什么?

171
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:44,104
We call that probing.
我们管这个叫做探测

172
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:45,734
You're not looking for more gas?
你不是在找寻更多的瓦斯吧?

173
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:47,350
Oh, yes. We never stop!
哦, 是的, 我们从未停止!

174
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:50,444
There's a door here. Where's it lead to?
这里有道门, 它通向哪里?

175
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:53,894
I've no idea. To my knowledge,
those doors were never opened.
我不知道. 据我的了解, 那些门从来没有打开过

176
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:55,275
Could be an old shaft.
可能是一个旧的竖井

177
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:58,642
Why would it need such a new door?
And so strong?
为什么它需要一道这么新的门? 还这么结实?

178
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,472
Hey, look out!
嘿, 小心!

179
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:02,479
Ah, you've made the connection?
啊, 你搞定连接了?

180
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:05,049
Of course. Otherwise you wouldn't be here.

181
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:06,471
Now, be careful, Medok.

182
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:09,131
There are other places worse than
the Danger Gang, you know.
有些地方比危险组更严重, 你知道吧

183
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:12,715
This is a high pressure strike.
You are going to need a stronger screw than this.
这是一个高压泄漏点, 你需要一个比这更结实的螺杆

184
00:10:12,848 --> 00:10:15,157
- Don't touch it.
- I know what I'm doing.

190
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,392
How long do you think Ben was watching us?

191
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:45,582
I don't know.
我不知道

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,878
Do you think he saw you take the keys?
你觉得他看到你拿走钥匙了吗?

193
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:48,583
- Well, if he did, we're in trouble.  - Yes.
- 啊, 如果他看到了, 我们就有麻烦了  - 是啊

194
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:50,412
It just means we'll have to make
use of them quick as we can.

But where, Jamie. And how?
