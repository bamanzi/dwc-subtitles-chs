all this machinery myself.
而且, 我不确定自己能否搞懂这些机器什么的

better use of the opportunity, Doctor?

with masks, aren't you?

You aren't taking them down there
without any protection?

00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:45,874
Surely you could have seen to that?

It wasn't your fault
you betrayed your friends.

What's it all for?
这有什么作用?

00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:48,152
It's a poisonous gas which we mine,
from the bowels of this planet,

131
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:50,052
which kills us if we breathe it.

132
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:52,552
No one knows what it's used for.

133
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:12,683
Yes.
对了

134
00:07:13,523 --> 00:07:18,201
Now one must assume that
the relative connection is constant.

00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:05,610
Oh, you did give me a turn.
哦, 你吓了我一跳

139
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,190
Where did you find it?
你在那里找到的?

140
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,258
What?
什么?

141
00:08:08,383 --> 00:08:09,222
The formula.
这个公式

142
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:12,081
In my head. You know.
从我的大脑里

143
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:15,839
Don't lie. That is a secret known
only to three people in the Colony.
别撒谎. 这是一项秘密, 这个殖民地只有三个人知道

144
00:08:16,494 --> 00:08:17,471
And you're one of them?
而你是其中的一个?

145
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,315
Naturally. And you're not asking me to believe...
当然. 你不是要我相信...

146
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:22,615
that in a few moments you have been
able to work out a formula...
在顷刻之间你就能够推导出一个公式...

147
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:25,915
which it has taken our
combined computers years to perfect?
而这个公式我们是耗费多台电脑数年时间才完善出来的...

148
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:27,652
It does seem rather a tall order.
看起来的确是个高阶的

149
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:31,262
Yes, of course. I know what you've done.
是的, 当然了. 我知道你干了什么

150
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:33,862
You've broken into our secret files,
haven't you?
你偷看了我们的机密文件, 是吧?

151
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,967
I wouldn't know how to do that. Take a look.
我不知道怎么干那个. 你看看

152
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:40,285
Well, you must have seen the document.
That's the exact computation.
是了, 你肯定看过文档了, 这个计算过程是完全一样的

153
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:42,919
Really? Huh. In that case...
真的吗? 哈, 这样的话...

154
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:49,622
Do you really mean to say
that you worked that out by yourself?
你真的是想说, 你完全自己推导出来的?

155
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:53,086
Well, I did have a little assistance.
哦, 我的确靠了一点小小的协助

156
00:08:53,305 --> 00:08:54,948
Yes, I thought so. Who was it?
是的, 我也觉得. 是谁?

157
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:57,541
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. No person. No.
噢, 不, 不. 噢, 不. 不是人. 不是

158
00:08:57,823 --> 00:09:00,541
I simply mean that I took readings
from the various dials.
我只是说我从多个仪表盘上采集了数据

159
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:02,101
They appeared to be related,
它们看起来是有关联的.

160
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:04,361
so I worked out the principle
that controls them.
所以我推导出来了控制它们的原理

161
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,961
It was simple really.
Like doing a sum backwards.
其实很简单, 真的. 就像倒着求和一样

162
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:08,902
- Backwards?
- Yes. You know...
- 倒着?   - 是的. 你知道...

163
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,742
Given the answer, what's the question?
就是给定答案, 找出问题

164
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,053
Wipe it away. Get it off there
before anybody else sees it.
擦掉吧. 在其他人看到之前, 把它弄掉

165
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:17,887
Oh, well. If you insist.
噢, 好吧, 你非得坚持的话

166
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:22,586
Ho, ho. There now.
喔呵呵, 看看

167
00:09:22,706 --> 00:09:25,659
If anyone follows that formula,
there'll be an almighty explosion
如果有人按这个公式走, 就能引发一场巨大的爆炸

168
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:27,959
x to the power of y is derivative 2 3's of 6!
y 的 x 次幂是导数的 2 3 得 6!

169
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:29,237
Get it off.
擦掉它

170
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,122
What are they doing?
他们在做什么?

171
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:43,834
We call that probing.
我们管这个叫做探测

172
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,464
You're not looking for more gas?
你不是在找寻更多的瓦斯吧?

173
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,080
Oh, yes. We never stop!
哦, 是的, 我们从未停止!

174
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:50,174
There's a door here. Where's it lead to?
这里有道门, 它通向哪里?

175
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:53,624
I've no idea. To my knowledge,
those doors were never opened.
我不知道. 据我的了解, 那些门从来没有打开过

176
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:55,005
Could be an old shaft.
可能是一个旧的竖井

177
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:58,372
Why would it need such a new door?
And so strong?
为什么它需要一道这么新的门? 还这么结实?

178
00:09:58,762 --> 00:10:00,202
Hey, look out!
嘿, 小心!

179
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:02,209
Ah, you've made the connection?
啊, 你搞定连接了?

180
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:04,779
Of course. Otherwise you wouldn't be here.

181
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,201
Now, be careful, Medok.

182
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,861
There are other places worse than
the Danger Gang, you know.
有些地方比危险组更严重, 你知道吧

183
00:10:09,197 --> 00:10:12,645
This is a high pressure strike.
You are going to need a stronger screw than this.
这是一个高压泄漏点, 你需要一个比这更结实的螺杆

184
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,887
- Don't touch it.
- I know what I'm doing.
- 别碰它  - 我知道我在做什么

185

188
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,645
Get him up. I'll look after him.
扶他起来, 我来照看他

189
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,645
Yeah. It's all right, mate. Hang on.
好, 应该没事了, 伙计. 坚持住

190
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,122
How long do you think Ben was watching us?

191
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:45,312
I don't know.
我不知道

192
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,608
Do you think he saw you take the keys?
你觉得他看到你拿走钥匙了吗?

193
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,313
- Well, if he did, we're in trouble.  - Yes.
- 啊, 如果他看到了, 我们就有麻烦了  - 是啊

194
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:50,342
It just means we'll have to make
use of them quick as we can.

But where, Jamie. And how?
