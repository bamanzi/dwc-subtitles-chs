1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:45,077
Right. Now!

3
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:48,588
No. Look, out there.

4
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:50,216
I don't see anything.

5
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:54,248
In that patch of moonlight. I told you I'd seen them!

6
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:14,835
Ah! That proves it! I wasn't seeing things!

7
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:16,623
Medok - the guards. They'll hear you.

8
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:21,439
It doesn't matter. They can't lock me up again. Now I can prove it. We know they're real.

9
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,461
Medok.

10
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:26,344
Medok. I know you're in there. Come out quietly.

11
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:28,254
You can put that gun away. I'm coming.

12
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,165
Who's with you?

13
00:01:29,336 --> 00:01:30,001
The Doctor.

14
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,084
What are you doing here?

15
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:32,481
Don't waste time. Come on over here.

16
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,813
Stay where you are.

17
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:34,996
Listen, I came out to show you.

18
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,144
Stand still!

19
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:38,938
It's the Macra, Ola! They are real! Ask the Doctor. He'll tell you.

20
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:40,554
Yes, I think I can confirm...

21
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:42,875
We don't want to know what the strangers think.

22
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,558
Well, it might be as well to...

23
00:01:44,863 --> 00:01:47,694
Ha, ha, ha. Where do you think you're going?

24
00:01:47,934 --> 00:01:48,984
I just thought I'd go and have a look.

25
00:01:49,195 --> 00:01:51,288
Stay where you are. Guards - search him.

26
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:55,983
What will they do to us?

27
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:05,924
I'll tell you. You're going before the Pilot. You are in the company of an escaped criminal. And you were out in the Colony at night.

28
00:02:07,108 --> 00:02:09,772
I'm sorry, Doctor. I thought he'd listen to reason.

29
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:12,927
Reason's the last thing a man like Ola will listen to.

30
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:15,837
You're going to be in trouble, and it's my fault.

31
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:20,911
Silence! Pilot's headquarters. Move!

32
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:36,254
...shifts to stand by for greater efforts during working hours. The gas from the pits must be kept in constant supply at even greater pressures. Remember the life of the colony is dependent upon this gas. All industry and activity...

33
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:44,875
Emergency call. Emergency call.

34
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:46,371
Yes. Go ahead, emergency.

35
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:51,528
Ola requests audience immediately. Ola requests audience immediately.

36
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,312
Look, I'm extremely busy. Unless this is a major crisis, I really don't...

37
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:59,023
Medok has been taken prisoner and one of the strangers has been captured with him.

38
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:00,921
Bring the stranger in.

39
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:06,983
Good evening, Pilot. Oh, what a very nice office you have here.

40
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:08,609
Now what's this all about, Doctor?

41
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:09,647
Well, I...

42
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:12,026
We found both of them in the new buildings, Pilot.

43
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,831
At night? How did he get there? Wasn't there a guard on his sleeping quarters?

44
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:16,936
All my guards were out looking for Medok, Pilot.

45
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:20,966
I see. Very well. You may leave us, Ola. I will conduct the investigation myself.

46
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:38,947
Oh, forgive me. This is interesting - a telescopic viewing machine, hmm? I imagine you can keep track on the entire Colony from here and direct intercommunication between all parts. Hmm. Very up-to-date, I imagine. Excellent, excellent. And what...

47
00:03:39,146 --> 00:03:42,986
You don't seem to realize how serious this business is, Doctor. You have committed a crime.

48
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:44,853
A crime?

49
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:47,556
What were you doing with Medok? You know he's a dangerous man.

50
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,841
I'm not so sure, Pilot.

51
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:55,770
You have already been told. He has refused to cooperate and to obey orders. He suffers from hallucinations.

52
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,489
Ah, that's the point. Does he?

53
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:01,024
And what exactly do you mean by that?

54
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:03,898
Let me perhaps explain.

55
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:09,874
Well, what is it now? I've already said that I don't want to be interrupted.

56
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:11,398
Ola reporting, Pilot.

57
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:12,675
Well, what is it?

58
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,964
Medok has made a statement. It completely changes the situation.

59
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,667
Oh, very well. Bring him in.

60
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,780
I hope you are not going to listen to everything that Medok tells you?

61
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:24,929
Why, Doctor? Are you afraid of something he might say?

62
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:27,170
Well, in his state of mind he might say anything.

63
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,254
Doctor. How have they been treating you?

64
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:33,102
Silence!

65
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:34,344
Perfectly all right, thank you.

66
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,503
Medok's made a further statement, Pilot. It's about the Doctor.

67
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:38,335
Ah.

68
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:39,188
Aha.

69
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:40,109
Yes, Medok?

70
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:43,750
The Doctor wasn't helping me. He was trying to make me give myself up.

71
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:48,374
Well, that was extremely brave. Why didn't you tell us this?

72
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:50,558
Well, as a matter of fact...

73
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:52,421
Captain Ola didn't give him a chance.

74
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:56,202
I see. Well, it seems we owe you an apology, Doctor.

75
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:59,268
It's better we tell the truth, Doctor.

76
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:03,596
Yes. Thank you Medok. I... I quite understand.

77
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:04,619
Take him away.

78
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,898
Come on Medok.

79
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,537
Well, I'm extremely sorry about it, Doctor, and of course you're free to go.

80
00:05:11,974 --> 00:05:13,463
What will happen to Medok?

81
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:25,493
Oh. Well, he'll be taken back to the hospital for correction. He'll be given another course of treatment. And when he returns to the Colony, Medok will be a changed man. He will cooperate and he will obey orders. He'll be just like the rest of us.

82
00:05:25,755 --> 00:05:27,446
Why do you want everyone to be the same?

83
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:51,030
Doctor, this colony was founded many centuries ago by our ancestors who came from the Earth planet, like your young friends. Our ancestors believed in the virtues of healthy happiness and we have tried to keep their ideals alive. Sometimes, alas, it is necessary to use force. The Doctor will be returning to his quarters now.

84
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,382
The Doctor's escort is ready.

85
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,835
Well, I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Doctor, and many thanks again for your help.

86
00:05:57,051 --> 00:05:58,570
Not at all. Thank you. Goodnight.

87
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:03,936
Oh, I'm so sorry.

88
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,092
Goodnight.

89
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:38,388
The Doctor and his friends are to be given the advantage of high powered adaption at once. They must begin to think like members of the Colony. They are to have deep sleep and thinking patterns. We cannot have criticism from these strangers! The work to do it - it must begin immediately.

90
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:45,263
Emergency order from Control, top priority. Are all the cubicles connected?

91
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,777
The rest cubicles for the four strangers are all connected for deep sleep and thought patterns.

92
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:55,762
Very good. The process is to begin immediately. Your instructions are being carried out.

93
00:06:57,723 --> 00:07:16,121
That is good. This is an emergency. Control must be believed and obeyed! No one on the Colony believes in Macra! There is no such thing as Macra! Macra do not exist! There are no Macra!

94
00:07:27,257 --> 00:08:29,100
The sleeper must relax and believe. Everything in the Colony is good and beautiful. You must accept it without question. You must obey orders. The leaders of the Colony know what is best. In the morning when you wake up you will be given some work. You will be glad to obey. You will question nothing in the Colony.

95
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:42,428
Ben? Ben?

96
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,307
Huh? What is it?

97
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,886
I heard something.

98
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:49,378
Oh, you're always hearing something.

99
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:57,501
I never heard a voice like this before. Ben?

100
00:08:58,172 --> 00:08:59,526
I'm asleep.

101
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:10,480
It was evil, Ben - an evil voice. An evil that spoke so gently and yet... yet I almost believed what it said.

102
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:14,807
Oh, look, mate. Get some sleep. We got a hard day's work ahead of us tomorrow.

103
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:17,768
Why do you say that?

104
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:23,752
Well, we've got to do something to help in the Colony. We can't just eat their nosh without helping out.

105
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,186
You sound just like that voice, Ben.

106
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:32,635
Oh, what are you on about? This colony's all right. It won't be too bad to work here.

107
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,693
I never heard you talk that way before, Ben.

108
00:09:55,274 --> 00:10:11,571
You will not resist the sleeping gas. Breathe deeply. In the morning, when you wake, you will obey.

109
00:10:57,809 --> 00:10:58,845
Wake up, Polly.

110
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:01,422
Doctor? What on earth are you doing?

111
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,294
I've been scotching a rumour. Or should I say, scorching.

112
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,969
What happened?

113
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:10,536
Polly, I think you've been listening to some very bad advice.

114
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,215
But I've been asleep.

115
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:21,900
Yes, I know you have. Fast asleep. Very fast asleep. Polly, do you smell anything? A sort of sweet perfume?

116
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:22,986
No.

117
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:29,220
Never mind. Polly, I want you to forget everything that you've been dreaming.

118
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:31,158
Why do you say that?

119
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:46,804
Well, it's just possible that you've been given a series of orders while you've been asleep. You know, do this, do that, do the other thing. My advice to you is don't do anything of the sort. Don't just be obedient. Always make up your own mind. What am I thinking of? Ben and Jamie!

120
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:03,960
Hello, Doctor. Is it morning?

121
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:06,425
No, not yet. Nearly so.

122
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:08,604
What are you up to?

123
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:16,757
Well, by my calculations, there should be a thin strand of wire in the wall here, like a nerve tapping the subconscious of the human brain.

124
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:19,751
Lay off, mate. You'll find yourself on a charge.

125
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:22,811
Should be here somewhere. Ah!

126
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:26,080
Pack it in, Doctor. The way you mess about you could do some damage.

127
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:28,436
Better some damage than loss of will power.

128
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,298
What are you on about? Look, get out of it. It's against the law.

129
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:33,591
What law?!

130
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:38,732
The law of the Colony. Don't do that!

131
00:12:40,454 --> 00:12:42,153
Now you'll get chucked in jail.

132
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:45,199
What's the matter with you, Ben? Since when did you start to worry?

133
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:47,977
He thinks he knows best all the time, but this time he's wrong.

134
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:49,614
Hey, what's all the noise?

135
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:51,746
Jamie, how did you sleep?

136
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:55,496
Oh, very badly, Doctor. I told Ben I kept hearing wee voices.

137
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:59,840
That's a good sign. That means they haven't been able to get very deeply into your brain.

138
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:01,336
Eh? I don't understand?

139
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:02,629
I'll show you. Watch this.

140
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:10,886
You're fools, all of you! Just look what you've done! You've smashed up all this equipment!

141
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:13,780
Yes, but look here. If they were trying to make us believe a whole load of rubbish...

142
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:23,589
Rubbish? It's not rubbish. Control knows what's best for us. They want us to cooperate. We should be helping.

143
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:27,385
What's the matter with you Ben? This doesn't sound like you at all.

144
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:31,219
We should learn to obey. The Doctor's causing trouble. I'm going to turn him in.

145
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:32,616
You don't know what you're doing, Ben.

146
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,558
Get off me!

147
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:34,542
What's the matter with him?

148
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:35,729
I'm very much afraid I'm too late.

149
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:36,511
Ben!

150
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:37,394
Let go of me.

151
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,335
Ben!

152
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:39,276
Guards!

153
00:13:39,522 --> 00:13:40,226
Guards!

154
00:13:40,476 --> 00:13:41,275
Don't let him go.

155
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,318
No, it's no use, Jamie.

156
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:43,519
But we cannot let him go, Doctor.

157
00:13:43,714 --> 00:13:44,909
You'll have to. Violence will get you nowhere.

158
00:13:47,104 --> 00:13:49,948
Doctor, he's going to go and tell the guards. We've got to get you out of here.

159
00:13:50,147 --> 00:13:51,201
We can't leave Ben.

160
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:52,393
But he betrayed you.

161
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:58,693
No, no. Not Ben. He's not in control of his actions. He's been given a series of instructions and he can't help himself.

162
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,643
Yes but he...

163
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:03,834
That's Him! He prodded about in the wall and smashed up our equipment.

164
00:14:04,591 --> 00:14:09,942
This time we've got the evidence, and from one of your own friends. Come on, Doctor.

165
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:10,967
Leave him alone.

166
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:12,684
Get out of my way. That's an order.

167
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:14,712
I take orders from no one but the Doctor.

168
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,227
All right, you're coming too. Get out both of you!

169
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:19,852
Thank you, Jamie, but I'd better go with Captain Ola.

170
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:22,395
But Doctor, what will they do to you?

171
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:25,450
He should be in that hospital of yours.

172
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,726
You traitor. You...

173
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:27,739
That's enough!

174
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:38,629
The hospital. He needs correction more than Medok does.

175
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:49,450
You wish to cooperate. You have seen no strange creatures. You will work hard and happily. Hard and happily. You wish to cooperate. You have seen no strange creatures.

176
00:14:49,872 --> 00:15:00,926
It's a very difficult case, I'm afraid. Nothing much we can do. He's too far gone to help. No, he'll never be happy like the rest of us. All we can do is send him to the pits for life.

177
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:02,977
Can't hide the truth.

178
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:13,694
Yes, what is it? What's that? The Doctor? I'll come at once. Keep at it.

179
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:23,772
What did you do it for? The Doctor's our friend.

180
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:25,577
I had to do my duty.

181
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:29,904
Well, you go on doing it, then. I'm going to go and find out where the others have gone.

182
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,264
Look, Polly, you'd better stay here.

183
00:15:31,424 --> 00:15:32,467
Go on, report me.

184
00:15:32,624 --> 00:15:33,819
Now look. Come back, Polly.

185
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:35,769
Polly! Polly!

186
00:15:40,440 --> 00:16:04,349
Polly, where are you? Polly? You'll be in trouble.

187
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,340
Don't fool about, Polly. You must obey Control.

188
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,527
Polly?

189
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:43,613
Stop!

190
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,532
Leave me alone.

191
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:49,054
You're coming back to the guard.

192
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:51,312
What's the matter with you, Ben? Wake up!

193
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:53,582
You're coming with me, girl. You broke the Colony law.

194
00:16:57,867 --> 00:16:59,316
What's the matter with you?

195
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:03,734
There's nothing there.

196
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:25,842
But, there was! I saw it! A huge face, like an insect, or a giant crab. It was horrible and it was looking at us and... and... and it had claws. Claws like we saw on the time scanner.

197
00:17:26,518 --> 00:17:27,609
There's nothing there. Come on.

198
00:17:27,937 --> 00:17:28,741
No, not that way.

199
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,108
Look you're just trying to dodge off.

200
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:32,401
No, no. Please no. I'm not, but... but please look.

201
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:34,280
There is nothing there!

202
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:35,526
Ben.

203
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,530
What is it?

204
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:42,866
I... I don't know.

205
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:46,068
Well, what are we going to do?

206
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:49,177
There is nothing evil or harmful in this colony.

207
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:51,306
How can you believe that, studge?

208
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:54,607
It stands to reason. It's safe. There is nothing here.

209
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:06,936
Ben, what is this? Get it off me, Ben! It's got my foot! Ben, help!

210
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:30,729
Oh, it was horrible!

211
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:32,877
It's all right. I think it's going away.

212
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:09,695
Ben, behind you! There's another one! Ahh! Ben, they're all around us!

213
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,090
Polly, you make a run for it, and I'll keep them here.

214
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,015
No, you won't stand a chance.

215
00:19:14,448 --> 00:19:20,604
We can't stop here. Come on, quick! Ahh!

216
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:25,194
Ahh!

217
00:19:25,904 --> 00:19:30,639
You have destroyed three nerve circuits, Doctor. You have burned them out. What have you to say?

218
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:36,216
Rather neat, don't you think? And so simple. I did it with this.

219
00:19:36,486 --> 00:19:37,345
You admit it?

220
00:19:37,615 --> 00:19:38,619
I'm proud of it.

221
00:19:41,072 --> 00:19:42,580
What is it? What's the matter?

222
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:49,834
My dear Pilot, your wall? Even you were subjected to this form of subconscious control?

223
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:50,857
Leave that alone.

224
00:19:51,111 --> 00:19:52,017
That's better.

225
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,661
You will be punished for this.

226
00:19:53,856 --> 00:19:55,215
The least you can do is to say thank you.

227
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:56,189
Pilot!

228
00:19:56,384 --> 00:19:57,158
What is it?

229
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,790
It's the young man who reported the Doctor, Pilot.

230
00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:00,994
What about him?

231
00:20:01,177 --> 00:20:03,032
He has another report, Pilot. An urgent one.

232
00:20:03,223 --> 00:20:05,090
Very well, Ola, you may leave. I will deal with it.

233
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:07,005
Who are you stabbing in the back this time?

234
00:20:07,258 --> 00:20:08,505
Polly? Polly? What's the matter?

235
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:16,398
Doctor, it was horrible. A great insect, like... like a crab. It got hold of me. Ben got me free.

236
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:17,567
Ben did?

237
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,161
And he was nearly killed himself.

238
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:22,695
Silence. Did you protect the girl from such creatures?

239
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:25,493
She ran away. I went after her.

240
00:20:25,762 --> 00:20:29,925
Did you protect her, and were there such creatures?

241
00:20:31,175 --> 00:20:33,011
No. There were no such creatures.

242
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:34,164
Ben!

243
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:35,796
There are no such things as Macra.

244
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:36,925
But you saw them!

245
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,741
There were no such creatures! There are no such things as Macra!

246
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:41,398
Don't blame him, Polly.

247
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,683
But you heard him.

248
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:47,436
I told you. Ben has come under control of the evil forces at the heart of this colony.

249
00:20:47,631 --> 00:20:50,294
That is quite untrue. Control always acts for the best.

250
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:51,772
Who is Control?

251
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:54,409
You've seen our Controller.

252
00:20:54,677 --> 00:20:56,147
Have I? I don't remember.

253
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,741
Well switch on then. We've nothing to hide.

254
00:21:03,143 --> 00:21:08,908
Controller speaking. We know everything that's happened. The poor girl has had hallucinations.

255
00:21:09,158 --> 00:21:11,369
That's not the Controller. That's just a picture of a man.

256
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,298
It is a picture of our Controller.

257
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:15,444
Well, where is he? I'll wager he doesn't exist.

258
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:16,576
Of course he does.

259
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:17,641
Well, let's see him then.

260
00:21:17,825 --> 00:21:18,576
That's not necessary.

261
00:21:18,848 --> 00:21:19,751
Well, I don't believe he's there.

262
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:21,055
Of course he is, you've heard his voice.

263
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:22,576
Why don't you show him to us then?

264
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:31,075
Well all right. If you wish, I'll ask. Ah, as you can hear, Control, they... they ask to see you in person.

265
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,372
That set the cat among the pigeons.

266
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:36,492
They've not got him there.

267
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:42,614
This is your Controller. This is your Controller.

268
00:21:42,882 --> 00:21:43,906
But he's an old man.

269
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:45,500
Well, now you've seen the Controller.

270
00:21:48,464 --> 00:21:49,567
Well let him speak.

271
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:52,246
Be silent! That is an order!

272
00:21:52,488 --> 00:21:53,304
Let him speak.

273
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,413
Be silent!

274
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,339
Ah, he's not giving the orders. He can't talk.

275
00:21:56,699 --> 00:22:02,534
This is the man. You will hear him speak. Speak, Controller, speak!

276
00:22:03,203 --> 00:22:05,479
Speak? Am I to speak?

277
00:22:05,874 --> 00:22:08,054
Tell the strangers to believe and obey!

278
00:22:10,607 --> 00:22:35,033
I... I will tell them. I will tell them. I... I'll do what you say. Keep away. Don't touch me. I'll obey.

279
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,447
What's that? What's happening!

280
00:22:36,709 --> 00:22:41,896
Doctor, that was it - that thing in the picture! That was the claw! They're in control.

281
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,588
Take them out of here. They are condemned to the pits!

282
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,475
Macra!

283
00:22:44,678 --> 00:22:45,567
Take them away!

284
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:48,138
They're in control!
