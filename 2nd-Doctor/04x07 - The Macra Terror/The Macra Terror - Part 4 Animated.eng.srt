00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,800
<b>The Macra Terror</b>
(2019 Animated version. Episode 4)

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:04,800
(Sincro: bamanzi)

3
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:21,837
Retain full pressure.

4
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:26,973
Full pressures being maintained on master control.

5
00:01:27,089 --> 00:01:28,473
Reserves are standing by.

6
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:32,203
Let me see. Let me see.

7
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:34,427
Doctor, what could be happening to Jamie now?

8
00:01:34,675 --> 00:01:36,736
I hate to think.
It won't be anything very pleasant.

9
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:41,436
Polly, go and see what the first dial
on the control desk registers.

10
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:42,409
Right.

11
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:43,621
Hurry up.

12
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:48,447
Full pressure.

13
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:49,975
Full pressure. And the other one?

14
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:53,475
Come on.

15
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:56,445
Zero.

16
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,981
Zero. Now I think there's only one thing for it.

17
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:03,281
Plus must be made minus and minus must be made plus.

18
00:02:04,485 --> 00:02:06,000
What's the matter?

19
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:08,189
The question is which is plus
and which is minus?

20
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,159
Ooh.

21
00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:36,856
What are you doing?

22
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:38,227
Oh, just checking.

23
00:02:38,446 --> 00:02:39,939
Well, I don't need your help, thank you.

24
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:43,280
As you please. But, uh, I think
you're going to run into trouble.

25
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:44,310
Why? What's the matter?

26
00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:47,289
Well, according to my calculations,
the pressure gauges are wrong.

27
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,491
Don't be ridiculous.

28
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:51,829
Ridiculous? Well, that's as may be.

29
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:53,929
But, after all, three times three is nine,

30
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:56,929
and if you divide by half of
its own cubic capacity to the formula,

31
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:59,529
Pi over four squared,
I think you'll have to agree with me.

32
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,726
Don't touch that.

33
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,603
Why not?

34
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:05,263
That's the... That controls the inflow system.

35
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:07,486
Oh. So these are the inflow pipes, are they?

36
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:09,086
That's all I wanted to know.

37
00:03:09,278 --> 00:03:10,242
But what are you doing?

38
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:13,324
Inflow. Inflow. Outflow. Inflow.

39
00:03:13,418 --> 00:03:16,224
High pressure. Low pressure and O-U-T spells out.

40
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:17,533
Doctor, what are you doing?

41
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:19,431
It's alright, Polly.
Confusion is best left to the experts.

42
00:03:19,577 --> 00:03:21,110
But... Stop it!
You've no idea what you're doing.

43
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:22,901
Oh, yes I have.

44
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:25,731
I can stand an operation on its head
quicker than anyone. There!

45
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:29,931
I think you'll find I've revolutionised
the entire gas flow of the Colony.

46
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:32,429
You must be mad. You'll be locked up.

47
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,247
Polly, see what those dials register now.

48
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:37,314
Right. Doctor?
Something's happened to this one.

49
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:38,287
What does it read?

50
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:39,330
It's reads zero.

51
00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:40,583
And the other one?

52
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:42,877
- Full pressure.
- Good. Splendid.

53
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:44,876
That means there'll be
a fine old gale of fresh air...

54
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:46,976
blowing along the old shaft any time now.

55
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,783
Ah! Ah! Let go! No! Let...

56
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,883
Not yet, you're not.

57
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:15,081
You can do nothing.
You'll only delay matters.

58
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:17,381
It's a simple matter for me to reconnect the gas.

59
00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:19,439
Yes, I'm sure it is.
But I'm sure you'd like a little help.

60
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:21,992
Now stop that.
You've enough to answer for already.

61
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:26,427
Guard! Guard!

62
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,852
It's all right, Polly.
I've got his keys. Lock the door.

63
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,429
Send the guard, immediately!

64
00:04:36,063 --> 00:04:37,653
They're bound to get in sooner or later.

65
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:39,528
Yes. Well, the later the better.

66
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:41,268
The only thing we can do for Jamie
now is to give him time.

67
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:42,528
Lock the door.

68
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:07,927
This is Control.
Why has the outflow of gas stopped?

69
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:10,727
Gas must be pumped into the old shaft
without interruption.

70
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:13,327
Begin pumping immediately.

71
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,813
I need help immediately.
The strangers obey nothing.

72
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:19,313
They are turning taps in the wrong direction.

73
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:21,383
Guards have been detailed to assist you.

74
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:22,470
Open up in there!

75
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:27,485
Keys! My keys! Where are my keys?

76
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:29,837
Oh, dear. Your keys. Try, uh, in your pocket.

77
00:05:29,953 --> 00:05:31,437
Or on the gantry. Or over there.

78
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:32,544
Look, I know you've got them.

79
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,132
Doctor, the door.

80
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:36,299
Open up in there or we'll smash it in.

81
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:37,413
It's going to give way.

82
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:38,666
Come on, Polly. Let's get out of here.

83
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:41,558
No, not that way - it goes to the pits.

84
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:43,605
- Quick. Try that one.
- It's locked.

85
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:46,339
Then use the keys. Quick, Doctor. Quick!

86
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:52,009
Over there. Quick!
Stop them before they do any damage.

87
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:52,787
Get them!

88
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,458
Push, Polly! Push!

89
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:05,984
- I can't!  - You've got to.

90
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,579
Come on. Together.
I've nearly got it locked.

91
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,225
There we are.

92
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,259
- Where are we?  - Well...

93
00:06:27,342 --> 00:06:29,597
It looks rather like a cupboard
with a lot of pipes.

94
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,080
Where do you suppose they lead?

95
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:35,604
They must lead somewhere. Let's have a look.

96
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:43,536
Doctor, I think these are the pipes
that carry the poisonous gas.

97
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:45,076
Yes, very likely.

98
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, don't you think we'd better stay here?

99
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:52,469
Stay here? I'm not spending the rest
of my life with a lot of old pipes.

100
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:55,220
- But Doctor...
- Now, come along Polly.

101
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:57,359
I'm sure there's no need to be afraid.

102
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:01,359
Well... well, I think there's no need
to be afraid.

103
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:04,359
Oh, come on. Let's find out.

104
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:23,472
There, that ought to do it.
Let's hope we're not too late.

105
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:05,335
What do you know?

106
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:08,376
We all know Control is right,
and we must obey!

107
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:10,145
Let them know. Let them know.

108
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,799
Let them know they're happy!

109
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,620
Greet the morning with a shout.

110
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,395
Everyone up. The sun is out.

111
00:08:15,498 --> 00:08:17,386
- Rah, rah, rah!

112
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:19,970
Cheer for the Colony.
We're the gang that works the hardest,

113
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:23,370
and we must obey.
Obey Control. Ring the bell.

114
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,464
- Rah, rah, rah!
- Rah, rah, rah!

115
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:27,397
- Work well.  - Ring the bell!

116
00:08:27,484 --> 00:08:28,785
Oh, that's much better.

117
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:30,925
But, we'll do it again,
and this time with more feeling.

118
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:34,225
And, don't forget our job is
to inspire the others

119
00:08:34,284 --> 00:08:37,125
- our brave workers who are doing
such a dangerous job.

120
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,738
- All right?
- All right!

121
00:08:39,565 --> 00:08:40,674
What do you know?

122
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:43,681
We all know Control is right,
and we must obey!

123
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:45,868
Let them know. Let them know.

124
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:47,604
Let them know they're happy!

125
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:49,349
Greet the morning with a shout.

126
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,968
Everyone up. The sun is out.

127
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:52,772
- Rah, rah, rah!

128
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:56,390
Oh, that's very good!
That's beginning to sound like something.

129
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,990
It still needs a bit more clarity,
and I think that the girls could...

130
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,374
Say! how did you get there?

131
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,974
Oh, w... well, uh... I just,
um... as a matter of fact...

132
00:09:07,031 --> 00:09:09,148
Oh, I see. You're one of the dancers.

133
00:09:09,353 --> 00:09:12,253
One of the dancers? Oh, I'm afraid, uh...

134
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:15,153
Aye. Aye, y... yes. I'm one of the dancers.

135
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,499
And you got your dance ready?

136
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:18,365
My dance? Ah... Well, uh...

137
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,465
Yes. Yes, it's ready.

138
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:22,900
Well, go ahead. I'll see it now.

139
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:24,308
You'll see it now?

140
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:26,256
And don't forget you have to be very good

141
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:28,156
to get into the Happy Colony finals.

142
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,756
We want something gay and cheerful.

143
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:31,217
Gay and cheerful?

144
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,690
Have you any music?

145
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,669
Ah, no. I don't need it.

146
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,290
Go ahead. We'll pick up the rhythm
and clap to it.

147
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:39,432
- All right?
- All right!

148
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:43,050
Well, come on. Get on with it.
We haven't got all day.

149
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,580
Oh, aye.

150
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:52,880
That's very good.

151
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:54,831
- What do you call it?
- The Highland Fling.

152
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:57,047
Why do you call it the Highland Fling?

153
00:09:57,145 --> 00:10:00,494
Because we finish the dance
by flinging ourselves out the door.

154
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:02,618
Oh, that's very good! Come on now.

155
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:04,288
- Rah, rah, rah!
- Rah, rah, rah!

156
00:10:04,392 --> 00:10:05,747
Cheers for the Colony. Rah, rah, rah!

157
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,730
Where did this boy come from?

158
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:22,153
- Oh, he's one of the dancers.
- Nonsense. He's the escaped stranger.

159
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:26,117
You there - identify him.
Is this the boy you reported?

160
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:29,039
Well... Well... Yes.

161
00:10:29,283 --> 00:10:30,566
Ben, you gave me away.

162
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:34,250
Tie him up. Go to the Pilot.

163
00:10:34,815 --> 00:10:36,270
Tell him the stranger's found.

164
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:41,500
Tell him it won't be long before we
get our hands on his friends as well.

165
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:43,436
Jamie, I'm...

166
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:49,523
No permission is granted for the guards

167
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:50,923
to go on forbidden ground.

168
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:52,823
- Repeat, no permission.
- Shh. I hear voices.

169
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:55,923
Very faint.
<i>(They are not to cover the exit to the old shaft.)</i>

170
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:58,098
I don't hear anything.
<i>(This is in use at this moment by Control.)</i>

171
00:10:58,156 --> 00:11:00,800
- Stay here a minute, Polly.
- No. Don't leave me.
<i>(No one is to go near the old shaft.)<i>

172
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,523
The search for the other strangers
must be carried on.

173
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:07,089
It's the Controller.
The voice behind the screen.

174
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,058
All guards are detailed to hunt
for the Doctor and the girl.

175
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:13,808
They must be taken dead or alive.

176
00:11:15,406 --> 00:11:18,046
Look! He must be there.

177
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,732
This is Control.

178
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:35,832
The day shift is to begin work
in the emergency gas shaft.

179
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:40,732
All pressures are to be maintained.
The Colony cannot live without gas!

180
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:43,860
So that's where all the gas goes.

181
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:46,406
Yes. Just as I thought.

182
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:48,806
These creatures would die without it.

183
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,511
But how long have they been there?

184
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:53,611
I mean, they weren't always in control, were they?

185
00:11:55,571 --> 00:11:58,864
I couldn't tell you when they were here
in the first place, Polly.

186
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:01,164
They're like germs in the human body.

187
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:03,564
They've got into the body of this colony.

188
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:05,564
They're living as parasites.

189
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:07,317
You make it sound like a disease.

190
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:09,063
Polly, that's what I think they are.

191
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:11,760
They're in the control room.

192
00:12:11,842 --> 00:12:14,560
It must be like getting into the brain, mustn't it?

193
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:16,977
Yes. Very likely.

194
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:23,289
Shh. They might hear you.

195
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:27,671
Now then. One system must provide them
with the gas they need,

196
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:30,371
and the other one must be an outflow.

197
00:12:30,472 --> 00:12:32,466
Doctor, we've got to bring the Pilot here.

198
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:35,416
Then we can show him
these creatures really do exist.

199
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:38,564
Yes, Polly, I think it might work.

200
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:40,949
Look at me when I talk to you.

201
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:45,945
Ola, a word with you.
Where exactly did you catch him?

202
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:48,233
In here. In the hall, Pilot.

203
00:12:48,658 --> 00:12:50,666
I see. So, in fact, he gave himself up?

204
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:52,687
He should never have been allowed to escape.

205
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:54,739
Are you criticising Control?

206
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:56,645
I'm criticising the running of the pits.

207
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:58,251
But that is my job, Ola.

208
00:12:58,338 --> 00:13:00,383
I know that. But were it not for my guards,

209
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:02,683
this stranger would still be
a danger to all of us.

210
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:06,683
I am going to report to Control that
there is no discipline in the pits.

211
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:08,005
That's not the only report that
Control will get!

212
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:08,972
Ever since these strangers arrived

213
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:11,472
your authority in this colony has gone to pieces.

214
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:13,272
They come and go as they please,

215
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:15,172
and even now two of them are still missing.

216
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:16,663
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.

217
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,063
Well, everyone is up bright and early.

218
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,863
And the last two strangers
are not missing after all.

219
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,463
Oh, come now.

220
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:26,163
You can't have bad temper
and differences of opinion

221
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:27,863
in this happy type colony.

222
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,863
Say you're sorry, Ola.
Say you're sorry, Pilot.

223
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,134
Doctor, what did ye come here for?

224
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,134
- You've walked into a trap.
- Good morning, Jamie.

225
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,165
It's nice to see you so well cared for.

226
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:38,524
- Yes, but Doctor...
- Oh, it's all right. It's all right.

227
00:13:38,606 --> 00:13:41,101
I've just come in to have a word
with my old friend, the Pilot.

228
00:13:41,206 --> 00:13:44,101
Good morning, Ben. I hope
you're feeling more your old self?

229
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:45,483
Yes, Doctor. I am.

230
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:48,357
Why did not your guards arrest these strangers?

231
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,679
I don't know. Guards, arrest them!

232
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:52,285
That is no longer necessary.

233
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:55,393
Of course not. You can't arrest us
now we've given ourselves up.

234
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:56,893
That's against the rules.

235
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,783
Now. You wish to see me?

236
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:02,722
Yes. I do. Urgently. Come with me.

237
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:09,164
This is Control. Everyone is to return
to work immediately.

238
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:14,764
This order includes all executives.
It includes the Pilot.

239
00:14:14,846 --> 00:14:16,764
Everyone back to work immediately.

240
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:18,855
- Well, I shall have to go.
- No, wait.

241
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:21,142
You must listen to
what the Doctor's got to tell you.

242
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:23,242
They're only saying that because
they know what we've seen.

243
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:24,672
- At once!
- Pilot.

244
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,073
At once! That is an order!

245
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:28,951
Don't take any notice of them.

246
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:31,051
That's not your Controller.
Those are your enemies.

247
00:14:31,142 --> 00:14:33,518
There must be no discussion
with the strangers!

248
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,652
Why not?

249
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:35,918
Aye. What are you afraid of?

250
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:39,304
Arrest the strangers! That is an order!
All the strangers!

251
00:14:39,607 --> 00:14:41,480
That doesn't sound like a man in control.

252
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:45,577
What did you wish to tell me?

253
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,466
Pilot. You heard Control.

254
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,066
Guards, take them all away.

255
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:51,744
I am still the Pilot here.
You will take your orders from me.

256
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:53,344
Get back to your quarters.

257
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,188
Contact Control immediately.
Report the Pilot!

258
00:14:57,556 --> 00:14:59,721
That was a very brave thing to do.

259
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:02,226
Or very foolish.
What is it you wanted to tell me?

260
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,167
Come with me.

261
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,573
- Pilot!
- You will all remain here.

262
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:08,100
He disobeyed Control.
The Pilot will be arrested.

263
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:09,090
No.

264
00:15:09,392 --> 00:15:10,475
Anything may happen now, Jamie.

265
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:12,375
We've got to be ready to run for it.

266
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:13,768
We can't leave the Doctor.

267
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:15,152
He'll be back in a minute,

268
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,552
and Ben seems to be all right now.

269
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:20,671
More like the old Ben, I must admit.
But you still canna...

270
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:22,819
Where is he?

271
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,672
But, Doctor. This is forbidden territory.

272
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:44,174
Yes, and you'll soon see why.

273
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:46,180
Stop! Stop! You're breaking the law!

274
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:48,473
Bad laws were made to be broken. Follow me.

275
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:49,354
But...

276
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:54,756
What's happened to the Pilot, Ola?

277
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:55,956
The strangers have changed him!

278
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:57,548
The Pilot is a traitor.

279
00:15:59,588 --> 00:16:03,377
The Pilot has no more authority.
Ola is in command!

280
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,658
I really don't know why I trust you, Doctor.

281
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:10,803
Oh, perhaps I've got an honest face.

282
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:13,148
The Pilot is to be arrested!

283
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:16,648
This is a happy colony! All must obey!

284
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:17,711
Did you hear that?

285
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,254
Don't give up now. It's just up here.

286
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:32,580
All guards to report to the pit head.

287
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:36,280
They are to take orders from Ola.
It is understood?

288
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:44,490
There you are.
That's what's taken over this colony.

289
00:16:45,598 --> 00:16:49,190
You haven't been in touch
with Control, but with these.

290
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:51,690
They've used this colony for their own ends,

291
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:53,700
destroying you to live themselves.

292
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,009
Why...they're horrible.

293
00:16:55,651 --> 00:16:58,249
No, Doctor. It is they who must be destroyed.

294
00:16:58,391 --> 00:16:59,849
We must kill them.

295
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,808
- They're here!  - Let's go.

296
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:06,807
The Pilot and the stranger!
In forbidden territory!

297
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:08,007
They must be destroyed!

298
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:11,389
So, what are they, Doctor?

299
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:13,289
I mean, some monstrous form of bacteria?

300
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:14,589
Insects? Or what?

301
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:16,754
I don't know. But you must fight them.

302
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:17,887
How?

303
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,733
Take full command!

304
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:21,227
You mean defy Control?

305
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,948
Well, you see what Control really is.

306
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:26,817
Yes. You're right, Doctor,
they must be destroyed.

307
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,106
We've been waiting for you.

308
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:51,558
Ola, the Colony is in the hands of
grotesque insects!

309
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:53,263
So you've been seeing things?

310
00:17:53,443 --> 00:17:54,886
They're in there. The Macra!

311
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:58,699
Ha, ha, ha. You know
what happens to people that say that?

312
00:17:58,941 --> 00:17:59,627
But I...

313
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:01,490
Now we can deal with you all together.

314
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:04,084
- Did the Pilot has see them?
- Yes. I saw the Macra.

315
00:18:04,186 --> 00:18:05,865
It is forbidden to say that.

316
00:18:05,956 --> 00:18:07,720
Don't let him say that he has seen Macra!

317
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:10,496
I saw you! You are the Macra!

318
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:13,950
Silence! Silence the three strangers!

319
00:18:14,056 --> 00:18:15,490
That is an order!

320
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:16,991
What shall we do with them, Control?

321
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:20,790
Return them to the pipe room.
The three strangers and the Pilot.

322
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:23,880
They are to be locked in,
and you will not let them out.

323
00:18:24,032 --> 00:18:25,040
Come on, get in.

324
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:26,568
- Ola.  - Doctor!

325
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:28,602
Come on. You heard Control. Get in.

326
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:33,502
Don't worry Polly, I'll look after ye.

327
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:34,825
- No!
- Take your hands off her!

328
00:18:35,305 --> 00:18:36,043
Get in!

329
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:41,576
You have done well, Ola.

330
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:43,596
What instructions, Control?

331
00:18:44,153 --> 00:18:49,359
Clear the building. Guards and workers
are to return to the hall for music.

332
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:50,697
I obey, Control.

333
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:55,118
It will take precisely four minutes,

334
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:58,778
and then it will be safe for everyone
to return to work.

335
00:18:59,082 --> 00:19:01,599
Four minutes.

336
00:19:02,196 --> 00:19:03,899
Why four minutes?

337
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,111
Aye, what can they do in four minutes, Doctor?

338
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,568
I don't know. We must be ready for anything.

339
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:13,758
It's a gas! It's coming in here.

340
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,946
Pilot, do you know where it's coming from?

341
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:18,297
Why, no. I've never been here before.

342
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:21,694
There must be a hidden inlet.

343
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:26,975
You will not be able to fight it.
You cannot stop it.

344
00:19:27,212 --> 00:19:28,401
Doctor, I'm getting dizzy.

345
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:29,981
Polly, hold that in front of your mouth.

346
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,720
It's coming from over here, Doctor!

347
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:34,306
You're right, Jamie!

348
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:35,600
It's coming from here as well!

349
00:19:38,124 --> 00:19:41,519
You are unable to stop it.

350
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,675
- Polly?  - It will not last long.

351
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,670
Only for four minutes.

352
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:48,730
- By that time, you...
- Come on! Let us out!

353
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:54,245
...will be completely helpless,
not quite dead, helpless.

354
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,676
Hello in there.

355
00:19:57,157 --> 00:19:59,001
- Who is it?  - Ben.

356
00:19:59,224 --> 00:20:02,932
Ben? Is that you? Are you all right?

357
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,846
Can you open the door from your side?

358
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:05,856
No.

359
00:20:06,094 --> 00:20:07,447
But it's locked. There isn't a key.

360
00:20:07,713 --> 00:20:12,163
Ben, listen. We've got very little time.
It's all up to you.

361
00:20:12,457 --> 00:20:14,017
Go ahead Doctor. Tell me what to do.

362
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,824
Go to the control desk,
and you'll see two switches,

363
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,924
one marked outflow and one marked inflow.

364
00:20:22,197 --> 00:20:22,992
Hang on.

365
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:28,503
The other stranger has recovered.
He is now dangerous!

366
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:30,003
He will no longer obey Control.

367
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:33,003
The fourth stranger is trying to help his friends.

368
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,003
He is no longer one of us.
He must be stopped at once!

369
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:38,411
I've got them, Doc.
Two switches. What next?

370
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,223
Good. You see a lever in front of them?

371
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:43,154
Yeah, right first time.

372
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,743
It is forbidden to touch that instrument!
You must not obey the Doctor!

373
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,843
You will kill us all!
He intends to create an explosion!

374
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:54,740
Come away from those instruments!
You will destroy the Colony!

375
00:20:54,864 --> 00:20:57,244
Oh, shut up. Okay, Doctor. Fire away.

376
00:20:57,392 --> 00:21:00,010
Guards! Stop the stranger!

377
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:03,409
Switch on both inflow and outflow.

378
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:07,868
No! Stop! The pressure will be unbearable for all!

379
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:09,718
The human beings as well...

380
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,152
Switch them on, Ben.
Then stand by to throw the lever.

381
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:15,623
You are to give no such order!

382
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:19,170
Inflow on. Outflow on.

383
00:21:19,252 --> 00:21:20,870
Okay, Doc. Ready with the lever.

384
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:23,707
Quickly, Doctor!

385
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:27,728
Throw the lever away from you.

386
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:31,772
No! No! Don't let him.

387
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:38,058
No!

388
00:22:10,926 --> 00:22:14,042
Now, my first duty is to thank the strangers,

389
00:22:14,176 --> 00:22:16,092
for they have saved our Colony.

390
00:22:18,591 --> 00:22:21,747
A dance festival will be held every year
in their memory,

391
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:24,647
and the winners will be awarded
the Strangers' Trophy.

392
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,114
Where's the Doctor?

393
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:28,147
He's playing his pipe over there.

394
00:22:28,437 --> 00:22:29,538
Well, I've got a tip-off he'll wanna hear.

395
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,035
Hey, Doctor? Doctor?

396
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:34,054
Relax. Relax. More haste, more waste.

397
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:35,754
Pleasure is beautiful.

398
00:22:35,878 --> 00:22:37,841
Relax? You wait till you hear
what they're going to do with you.

399
00:22:38,138 --> 00:22:38,903
Oh, well? Ha, ha, ha.

400
00:22:38,988 --> 00:22:40,149
Yeah, I just heard it on the grapevine.

401
00:22:40,188 --> 00:22:42,149
They're going to draft us as members of the Colony,

402
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:43,149
and make you the next Pilot.

403
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:46,113
They can't do that to me.

404
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,477
- Let's get out of here.
- Yes, but how?

405
01:22:48,693 --> 01:22:51,896
Take a leaf out of Jamie's book.
Give them the old dance routine.
