00:08:58,172 --> 00:08:59,526
I'm asleep.
我睡着了

101
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:03,480
It was evil, Ben - an evil voice
很邪恶的, Ben - 一个邪恶的声音

101
00:09:04,303 --> 00:09:10,480.
An evil that spoke so gently and yet...
yet I almost believed what it said.
一个邪恶的声音在轻声说话, 而且...我几乎就相信了它所说的

102
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:14,807
Oh, look, mate. Get some sleep.
We got a hard day's work ahead of us tomorrow.
噢, 看啊, 老兄．睡一会儿吧．我们明天还有一整天的苦活儿呢

103
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:17,768
Why do you say that?
你为什么这么说？

104
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:23,752
Well, we've got to do something to help in the Colony.
We can't just eat their nosh without helping out.
我们得帮殖民地做点什么．我们不能吃着他们的, 什么也不帮

105
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,186
You sound just like that voice, Ben.
你听起来正像那个声音, Ben

106
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:32,635
Oh, what are you on about? This colony's all right.
It won't be too bad to work here.
噢, 你在说什么啊？这个殖民地很好．在这里工作不会太差

I never heard you talk that way before, Ben.
我以前从没有听你这样说过, Ben

Breathe deeply.
你不会抵制睡眠瓦斯．深深呼吸

110
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:01,422
Doctor? What on earth are you doing?
博士？你到底在做什么啊？

111
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,294
I've been scotching a rumour.
Or should I say, scorching.
我一直在扑灭谣言, 或许我该说fixme

112
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,969
What happened?
怎么了？

113
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:10,536
Polly, I think you've been listening to
some very bad advice.

But I've been asleep.

Polly, 你闻到什么了没？一种甜甜的香水味？

116
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:22,986
No.
没有

117
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:29,220
Never mind. Polly, I want you to forget everything
that you've been dreaming.
别管了．Polly, 我要你忘记你做梦时的所有事情

118
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:31,158
Why do you say that?
你为什么这么说？

119
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:35,804
Well, it's just possible that you've been given
a series of orders while you've been asleep.
哦, 只是有可能在你睡着的时候, 你被灌输了一系列的命令

119
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,804
You know, do this, do that, do the other thing.
你知道的, 做这个, 做那个, 做其它事情

我给你的建议是这类事情都不做

Always make up your own mind.
不要单纯地服从．永远要自己做决定．

What am I thinking of? Ben and Jamie!
我在想什么呢？Ben 和 Jamie!

120
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:03,960
Hello, Doctor. Is it morning?
你好, 博士．到早上了？

No, not yet. Nearly so.

122
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:08,604
What are you up to?
你要干什么？

123
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:13,757
Well, by my calculations, there should be
a thin strand of wire in the wall here,
哦, 根据我的计算, 在墙内这里会有一根细电线

123
00:12:13,795 --> 00:12:16,757
like a nerve tapping the subconscious of the human brain.
像一个神经一样搭在人类大脑的潜意识上

124
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:19,751
Lay off, mate. You'll find yourself on a charge.
放下, 老兄．你会面临指控的

125
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:22,811
Should be here somewhere. Ah!
应该在这里某处, 哈！

126
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:26,080
Pack it in, Doctor. The way you mess about
you could do some damage.
fixme放回去, 博士．你这样乱来, 会损坏东西的

127
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:28,436
Better some damage than loss of will power.
损坏一点东西好过意志力丧失

128
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,298
What are you on about? Look, get out of it.
It's against the law.
你在搞些什么？快, 出来, 这是违反法律的

129
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:33,591
What law?!

130
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:38,732
The law of the Colony. Don't do that!

131
00:12:40,454 --> 00:12:42,153
Now you'll get chucked in jail.
现在你会被赶进监狱了

132
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:45,199
What's the matter with you, Ben?
Since when did you start to worry?
你怎么回事, Ben? 你从什么时候开始学会担心了？

133
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:47,977
He thinks he knows best all the time,
but this time he's wrong.
他总觉得他一直最明白, 但这次他错了

134
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:49,614
Hey, what's all the noise?
嘿, 刚才是什么声音这么吵？

135
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:51,746
Jamie, how did you sleep?
Jamie, 你睡得怎么样？

136
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:55,496
Oh, very badly, Doctor.
I told Ben I kept hearing wee voices.
哦, 非常差, 博士．我跟 Ben 说过我一直听到有人轻声说活

137
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:59,840
That's a good sign. That means they haven't
been able to get very deeply into your brain.
这是个好信号．意味着他们进入你的大脑还没有很深

138
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:01,336
Eh? I don't understand?
诶？我不明白

139

I'll show you. Watch this.

你们这些蠢人, 全都是！看看你都干了些什么！

You've smashed up all this equipment!
你们把所有的设备都砸烂了！

141
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:13,780
Yes, but look here. If they were trying to
make us believe a whole load of rubbish...
是的, 但看看这里．如果他们试图要让我们相信所有这一堆垃圾...

142
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:19,589
Rubbish? It's not rubbish.
Control knows what's best for us.
垃圾？这不是垃圾．管理员知道怎样对我们最好

142
00:13:19,988 --> 00:13:23,589
They want us to cooperate. We should be helping.
他们想让我们合作．我们应该帮忙

This doesn't sound like you at all.
你怎么回事, Ben? 听起来完全不像你

144
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:31,219
We should learn to obey. The Doctor's causing trouble.
I'm going to turn him in.
我们应该学着服从．博士在制造麻烦, 我应该检举他

00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:32,616
You don't know what you're doing, Ben.
你不知道你在做什么, Ben

146
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,558
Get off me!
别拉我！

147
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:34,542
What's the matter with him?
他怎么会是

148
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:35,729
I'm very much afraid I'm too late.
恐怕我一直太迟了！

149
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:36,511
Ben!

No, it's no use, Jamie.

00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:43,519
But we cannot let him go, Doctor.

157
00:13:43,714 --> 00:13:44,909
You'll have to. Violence will get you nowhere.
你不得不．暴力不会给你带来任何东西

Doctor, he's going to go and tell the guards.
We've got to get you out of here.
博士, 他会跑去告诉警卫．我们得带你离开这里

不, 不, 不是Ben．不是他自己在控制他的行动

and he can't help himself.

就是他！他在墙上乱砸, 破坏了我们的设备

This time we've got the evidence,
and from one of your own friends. Come on, Doctor.
这次我们有证据了, 还是你自己的朋友提供的．来吧, 博士

165
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:10,967

But Doctor, what will they do to you?
但是博士, 他们会把你怎么样？

171
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:25,450
He should be in that hospital of yours.

172
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,726
You traitor. You...

这是个很棘手的病例, 我觉得

我们做不了什么．他走得太远, 没法帮

不, 他永远不会像我们一样幸福
