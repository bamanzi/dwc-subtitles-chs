1
00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:31,088
There we are. In perfect flight.

2
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,240
- Yes, and look what happened last time!
- Oh, that. What a lot of fuss.

3
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,635
Just a bumpy landing. That's all.
It won't happen again.

4
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:38,973
- I know.  - What are you up to now?

5
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:42,360
- Let's have a look at the Time Scanner.
- The what?

6
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,696
The Time Scanner. Instead of
the normal picture showing where we are,

7
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,755
it gives you a glimpse of the future.

8
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:51,002
The second sight? Very dangerous.

9
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,219
Oh, Nonsense! I haven't used it very much.

10
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:55,965
It's not very reliable, as you can see.

11
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,902
- Doctor...  - Hmm?

12
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:09,477
Look!

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,800
<b>The Macra Terror</b>
(2019 Animated version)

14
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:24,700
(Sincro: bamanzi)

15
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:36,399
Oh, splendid! Splendid!
You've got a very good band there, Barney.

16
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:37,198
Thank you, Pilot

17
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:39,072
Mind you, I don't say
you'll come first at the festival,

18
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:42,672
but never say die, hmm, what?
Nothing succeeds like success, ha!

19
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:45,357
"If at first you don't succeed...?"

20
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:46,947
"... Try, try, try again!"

21
00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:47,970
That's right.

22
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:49,213
Stop him! Don't let him get out!

23
00:03:49,406 --> 00:03:50,316
What's the matter?

24
00:03:50,486 --> 00:03:51,981
- Medok!  - Let me go!

25
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,672
Medok! This is very foolish of you Medok.

26
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,172
It's for your own good.

27
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:56,799
Out of my way!

28
00:03:57,929 --> 00:03:59,923
He's far too dangerous
to be allowed to escape.

29
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,516
Get after him!
You should have stopped him!

30
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,532
What happened, Ola?

31
00:04:04,717 --> 00:04:05,833
He refused treatment
in front of my guards,

32
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,981
so I dismissed them
and he made a dash for it.

33
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:09,909
Well get after him.

34
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:12,117
He must not get away!

35
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,517
- Hey!  - Oh!

36
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:36,553
Oh, Ben! For goodness sake!

37
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:39,260
Well, what's the big stick for, Jamie?
Nothing's happened yet.

38
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,823
Have you no sense? Have you forgot
what we saw on that time scanner?

39
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:44,352
Don't, it was horrible.

40
00:05:44,414 --> 00:05:47,666
Aye, well, I'll not being left
without nothing to defend ourselves with.

41
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,417
I'm afraid you're wasting
your time, Jamie.

42
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,282
Why?

43
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:54,471
Unless I'm very much mistaken,
these creatures are so big...

44
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,871
they're going to see us
long before we see them.

45
00:05:57,142 --> 00:05:57,856
Look out Jamie!

46
00:05:58,447 --> 00:05:59,777
Hang on, mate, I'll get him!

47
00:06:01,073 --> 00:06:02,946
All right. Ben!

48
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,111
Be careful, Ben!

49
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:10,732
- Roll over on his back.
- That's it, get him!

50
00:06:11,026 --> 00:06:12,951
- Well done!  - Sit on top of him!

51
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:17,954
Ben, are you all right?

52
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:21,765
We don't know who you are, strangers,
but we are grateful.

53
00:06:22,156 --> 00:06:24,765
Medok is one of our last patients
in the Colony.

54
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:29,640
We've done our best for him
but he gets worse day by day...

55
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:36,740
I wasn't informed you were
travelling across our territory.

56
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:41,722
Hurry back to the Colony
and tell the Pilot what's happened.

57
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:43,374
Pilot?

58
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:45,815
Yes, the Pilot of our colony.

59
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,815
No doubt he will want to
thank you in person.

60
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,960
Tie him up tighter.

61
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,360
Come on, tighter!
I don't want any more trouble with him.

62
00:06:53,423 --> 00:06:55,660
Come on, I'll show you myself.

63
00:06:56,974 --> 00:07:00,453
- Er, uh, any good asking...
- ...where we are?

64
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:04,460
Well, according to my calculations
we're, er, certainly in the future and,

65
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:07,024
er, on a planet very like the Earth.

66
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:11,008
- How do you know?
- I don't know. I'm guessing.

67
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:14,381
My name is Ola.
I am the Chief of Police.

68
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:15,969
That sounds very important.

69
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:18,465
Oh, it's a very responsible job.

70
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:21,865
I take my instructions
from our Control centre.

71
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:25,356
Oh, it all works very well, as you will see.

72
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:28,556
Please follow me.

73
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:29,820
Oh, thank you.

74
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:37,530
Ah, not too tight?
It's bad for the blood pressure.

75
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:44,801
# Run, run, run, run...

76
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:45,910
# Run, run, run, run!

77
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:47,890
# Thank you shift...

78
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:51,193
# Thank you shift number one!

79
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,584
Pilot, these are the strangers
that have helped us.

80
00:07:57,914 --> 00:07:59,650
Very well, Ola.
I will look after our guests.

81
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:02,610
You will no doubt wish to take care
of poor Medok. You may leave.

82
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:06,951
Well, our thanks to you and welcome!

83
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:10,051
You are indeed a brave man
to tackle someone as disturbed as Medok.

84
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,072
Well, it was nothing.
Anyone would have done the same.

85
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:16,372
Well this is gay! Why all the music?

86
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:18,565
Oh, we regulate our day by music.

87
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:20,352
- Oh.   - Yes...

88
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,818
And now my friends, I suggest you
take advantage of our refreshing department.

89
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:25,755
Oh, lead me to it mate. I'm starving.

90
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:27,099
Oh, you will eat later.

91
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:29,159
Here we revive the weary body.

92
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:30,484
Oh.

93
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:32,087
Keep your eyes skinned.

94
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,270
Why? What's the matter?

95
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:36,308
Well, they're a weird sort of folk.
I don't know that I understand them.

96
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:44,679
Come along in, my friends.
It's just through the door there.

97
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:48,168
Pilot! Pilot! Control wish you
to call them immediately.

98
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:49,368
They wish to welcome our guests.

99
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:50,480
Oh, but of course.

100
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:51,936
Switch on please, my dear.

101
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:58,219
Hey, who's that? He looks smashing.

102
00:08:58,396 --> 00:08:59,715
That's our Controller.

103
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:06,093
We wish to welcome joyfully
the visitors to our colony.

104
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:10,093
We are very grateful to them.
They have performed a valuable service.

105
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:15,093
The Colony is to make our guests happy
and contented during their stay.

106
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:16,493
Welcome again, friends.

107
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:20,093
Now, back to work, everyone!

108
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:23,549
Well that's great!
I'm really going to enjoy myself.

109
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:24,756
Splendid! And now my good friends,

110
00:09:24,806 --> 00:09:27,956
let me put you into the hands of
our supervisor, Barney.

111
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:30,127
Dear old Barney, everybody calls him.

112
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:31,205
Well, thank you Pilot.

113
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,697
And I must leave you for...
Work calls you know,

114
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,497
and hard work never hurt anybody.

115
00:09:34,702 --> 00:09:36,410
Till later!

116
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:38,791
Delighted to see you.
Delighted to have you with us.

117
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:40,991
Now you have a complete choice
of all our treatments.

118
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,291
We have steam baths, beauty treatments,
perhaps a massage.

119
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,491
You sir, of course,
would like your clothes cleaned.

120
00:09:48,518 --> 00:09:52,707
And there's sunlight treatment, moonlight treatment,
sparkling and effervescent sprays...

121
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,628
I feel perfectly all right as I am, thank you.

122
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:57,589
Ah, go on Doctor. Don't be such a drag.
It all looks super.

123
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,200
Oh, not at all. It's all part of our service.

124
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:09,252
Come on, move back!
This prisoner's not to be trusted.

125
00:10:09,345 --> 00:10:13,352
He's violent and suffering from delusions.

126
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:17,934
I'm not the one suffering from delusions.
It's you! All of you!

127
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:20,334
You don't know what's happening in this Colony!

128
00:10:20,512 --> 00:10:21,425
Be quiet Medok!

129
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:23,357
There's only one way to silence me, Ola.

130
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,289
Medok, old fellow, it's Questa. Remember me?

131
00:10:26,322 --> 00:10:27,289
What's happened to you?

132
00:10:27,472 --> 00:10:29,324
It's no good. You can't reason with him.

133
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,808
Just a minute. He's an old friend.
One of the best.

134
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,603
- Ha!  - He's as cheerful as any of us.

135
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,122
Medok, what's happened to you?

136
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:37,922
What's all this about you seeing things?

137
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:40,494
I don't see things Questa, you fool!

138
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:42,894
There are things... horrible things...

139
00:10:43,031 --> 00:10:46,994
creatures, infesting this camp at night.

140
00:10:47,004 --> 00:10:47,685
That's enough!

141
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:51,885
Have you seen the Pilot?

142
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,400
He's with the strangers.
I've no idea where they are.

143
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,641
Back to work! Shift rest is over!

144
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,641
No time to be lost! The Colony needs you!

145
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,641
Preparation to be made for tonight's reception
- a welcome for the strangers!

146
00:11:08,865 --> 00:11:11,249
A reception tonight! A Colony party!

147
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:13,749
Medok, join in with the rest of us,
like you used to.

148
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:16,160
It will be fun for all!

149
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:18,437
You hear that Medok, fun for all.

150
00:11:18,607 --> 00:11:22,036
All right! Have fun while you can,

151
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:25,036
before they crawl all over you!

152
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:27,623
That's enough! Right, get back all of you.

153
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,521
There you are.
I wondered what had happened to you.

154
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:46,835
I don't know you. You don't belong here.

155
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:48,240
Do you belong here?

156
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:50,781
No, not any more.

157
00:11:50,982 --> 00:11:53,991
We don't talk to him. He sees things.
Come on Medok.

158
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:10,231
Can I help you?

159
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:14,614
What? Oh, no. No, it's all right, thank you.

160
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,114
I... I just thought I'd dropped something,
that's all.

161
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:33,743
Ha! What's the thing?

162
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:36,388
- Shh, I'm going to set you free.
- What?

163
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:39,586
Just hold still a minute.

164
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:42,586
There we are. One more.

165
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:47,431
Don't bother to say thank you.

166
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:54,931
Now, tell me something about these things
that you see, hmm?

167
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:59,231
Do they, for instance, appear to
crawl slowly over the ground?

168
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:00,497
How do you know?

169
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,233
Oh, just wondered that's all.

170
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:03,908
Listen!

171
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,077
I don't hear anything.

172
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:07,346
Someone's coming.

173
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:09,372
It's all right, I won't let them hurt you.

174
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,745
Get out of my way!

175
00:13:10,994 --> 00:13:11,962
Why don't you listen to me?

176
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,594
I am not being caught!

177
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:17,648
Stop him! Don't let him escape!

178
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:19,320
How did he get away? Who's responsible?

179
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:23,675
What happened?

180
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:27,038
I... I told him he wouldn't get hurt
and he wouldn't believe me.

181
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:28,434
You mean you let him go?

182
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:30,508
Well, no, not exactly.

183
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:34,626
He let the prisoner escape.
That is a crime in this Colony.

184
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:36,976
For that, men must work in the pit. Guard!

185
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:39,195
You can't touch him.
He doesn't know your laws!

186
00:13:39,356 --> 00:13:41,423
Er, that's true, Ola. He is a stranger here.

187
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,083
There's something else
you're forgetting gentlemen

188
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,783
I set free someone
that we caught in the first place.

189
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:47,837
True - a reasonable point of view, Ola.

190
00:13:48,012 --> 00:13:51,438
Medok is dangerous.
He should have never let him go.

191
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:54,438
The Colony will be petrified
when they know he's out there in the night.

192
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:56,760
Well, send your patrol after him.
He can't have got far.

193
00:13:56,917 --> 00:14:00,782
He can run you know. He's got legs.
He doesn't have to crawl over the ground.

194
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:02,084
Why did you say that?

195
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:04,549
Why, no reason. No reason at all.

196
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:07,995
Anyone who spreads
that kind of rumour in this Colony

197
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:10,595
will find himself
in the hospital for correction.

198
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:13,779
Oh... oh, that's where Medok is, is it?

199
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,177
I think, Doctor,
you will understand more about Medok

200
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,347
if you talk to some of the people
who knew him best.

201
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,415
- Pilot, I think...
- Now take the strangers to the labour centre Ola.

202
00:14:22,518 --> 00:14:25,515
See they learn something about us.
Please, go with him.

203
00:14:25,688 --> 00:14:26,874
Oh, well thank you.

204
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:48,461
- What is it?  - Nothing, come on.

205
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,432
This is your Controller speaking.
There is no need for alarm.

206
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:08,232
You may all continue your work and play,

207
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:11,532
confident that the best is being done for you.

208
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:15,432
But our unfortunate companion Medok
has been allowed to escape.

209
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:18,232
Emergency Patrols two and three
are now searching the Colony

210
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,832
and he is sure to be caught
before it is dark.

211
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:22,832
Now return to your work and play

212
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,432
...with fresh heart and renewed energy!

213
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,197
They got that bloke all over the place
like a blinking politician.

214
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:31,806
He is our controller.
We are always pleased to see him.

215
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:34,657
- He brings us encouragement.
- Oh, he's not a politician then!

216
00:15:36,992 --> 00:15:42,192
Number nine shift to stand by.
Leader to report to Youth Centre.

217
00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:43,771
Work shift ready to leave.

218
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:46,865
# We're happy to work, happy to play,

219
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:48,423
That's a nice wee tune Doctor.

220
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,853
Yeah, if you happen to like work.

221
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,102
It's a privilege to work for the Colony.

222
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,871
Shift leader reporting:
Shift number nine, all present and correct.

223
00:15:55,043 --> 00:15:57,039
Good. You're the first of the night shift.

224
00:15:57,401 --> 00:16:00,844
Uh, what do ye do then? Farming or fishing?

225
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:03,364
We work very hard here.

226
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:06,026
Yes, but what do you do?

227
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:08,916
We tap and refine gas.

228
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,010
For heating?

229
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:14,035
No, we use it for many things.
The Colony depends on it.

230
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:15,735
It's absolutely essen...

231
00:16:16,134 --> 00:16:19,331
Emergency! Quick, give me that! Come on!

232
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:22,026
Accident! Stand by, oxygen supply.

233
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,026
Take them away. Any other losses?

234
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:25,529
Two with gas sickness. Come on.

235
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,151
- What happened?  - Their work.

236
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:30,344
It can't be helped.
The work must be done.

237
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:33,370
Do you hear that, Doctor?

238
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:35,101
Where's he gone?

239
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:44,459
- Shh!   - I saw you.

240
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:47,331
- Get out!
- Oh, that's not very polite.

241
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:50,650
I was interested in what you were saying.

242
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:52,175
Who else knows I'm here?

243
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:54,757
No one. Why should I tell them?

244
00:16:54,854 --> 00:17:00,000
Now these creatures,
have you seen them clearly?

245
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,674
- What do they look like?
- What has it to do with you?

246
00:17:02,783 --> 00:17:05,439
Well, I'm interested. What do they look like?

247
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:10,429
All right. If you really want to know.

248
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:15,429
It's hard to say. They move at night, in the dark.

249
00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:20,429
And look horrible. Creatures... like giant insects.

250
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:22,640
With big claws?

251
00:17:22,969 --> 00:17:24,034
Yes, that's it.

252
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:26,454
You've seen them in the Colony?

253
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:27,400
Oh yes.

254
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,283
Has anyone else seen them?

255
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:33,730
A few, but they've lock them up
in the correction hospital.

256
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,207
- Why do they do that?
- Control tells them to.

257
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:38,749
They'll put me back there
when they catch me.

258
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,991
And they'll put you back there
for helping me.

259
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:45,397
- Doctor! Doctor!
- Go on! Quickly!

260
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:46,214
They're looking for you!

261
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:47,586
Doctor!

262
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:57,033
But we searched there, I'm sure.

263
00:17:57,347 --> 00:17:58,088
Aye.

264
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:04,846
- Were you looking for me?
- Where have you been?

265
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:06,420
I'm just looking around, that's all.

266
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:08,776
It's dangerous to go off on your own after dark.

267
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:10,321
Oh, I'm used to the dark. I like it.

268
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:14,155
We're confined to rest cubicles at night
by order of Control.

269
00:18:14,547 --> 00:18:18,155
Anyone who wanders around
the Colony at night... may be killed.

270
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:26,056
Curfew time. All personnel not on duty
must retire to quarters.

271
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:27,314
Do you hear that?

272
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,066
Emergency patrols two and three to remain on duty.

273
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:35,066
Work shifts to remain at their posts until dawn.

274
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:40,266
Visitors to retire for the night to
the refreshing department.

275
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,929
That's you. You're confined here.

276
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:49,709
Here we are, Doctor.

277
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:52,589
Your young friends are in their rooms over there.

278
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,502
Thank you.

279
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:56,569
I, er, I hope you sleep well.

280
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:59,691
Oh, I'm sure I will. Thank you. Goodnight.

281
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:00,814
Goodnight, Doctor.

282
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,731
It is now dark.
No one will go outside into the Colony.

283
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,731
A dangerous man is in hiding.

284
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,931
Our patrols have orders to shoot on sight.

285
00:19:39,435 --> 00:19:41,731
Happy sleep time everybody.

286
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:43,629
And the same to you!

287
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:05,405
Patrol two, over here,
Patrol three, follow me

288
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,473
If you see him, shoot to kill.

289
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:16,656
I'll have a look over there.

290
00:21:17,713 --> 00:21:19,098
It's all right. It's me.
Stay where you are.

291
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:21,912
- Why are you back?
- Don't move.

292
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,514
Have a look in those new houses
they're building.

293
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,977
He's coming! We'll have to get out!

294
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,126
Wait! If he comes in this way,
we'll go out the back.

295
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:29,736
If he comes in the back,
we'll go out here.

296
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:30,762
Yes, you're right. All right.

297
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:33,568
He's coming... to the front of the house.

298
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:36,463
Over here. I heard something.

299
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:38,990
All right. Go back.

300
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,128
You can't stay here.

301
00:21:40,313 --> 00:21:41,381
I'll try to create a diversion.

302
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:43,341
- No, they'll kill you!
- Do as I tell you.

303
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:45,915
Thanks.

304
00:21:46,158 --> 00:21:48,051
Go on. Go on.

305
00:21:54,628 --> 00:21:57,702
All right, we'll go through this opening
when I give the word.

306
00:22:00,756 --> 00:22:02,090
Right. Now!

307
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,362
No. Look out there.

308
00:22:05,988 --> 00:22:06,825
I don't see anything.

309
00:22:07,032 --> 00:22:11,263
In that patch of moonlight.
I told you I'd seen them!

310
01:08:09,495 --> 01:08:11,439
Please, may I have a shampoo?

311
01:08:11,703 --> 01:08:13,082
Shampoo, of course, for the young lady.

312
01:08:13,273 --> 01:08:14,044
Thanks very much.

313
01:08:14,226 --> 01:08:17,643
And for the young gentlemen, our very
latest treatment in our cubicles over there.

314
01:08:17,946 --> 01:08:22,552
Me? Oh, hey, you're not going to do that to me. I'm no lassie.

315
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:27,149
It's no good, Jamie, the lassies have got you!
And believe me mate, I'm not going to struggle.

316
01:08:27,616 --> 01:08:30,260
And now sir, for you...

317
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:38,953
Oh, very nice. Very nice indeed. You must certainly be
the most beautiful young lady in our Colony

318
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:41,553
and are quite sure to be elected our next beauty president.

319
01:08:41,873 --> 01:08:42,906
Thank you very much.

320
01:08:43,104 --> 01:08:45,554
Oh, not at all. It's all part of our service.

321
01:08:49,938 --> 01:08:50,872
To your liking sir?

322
01:08:51,235 --> 01:08:53,372
Ah, marvellous. Like being at anchor in the Med.

323
01:08:53,599 --> 01:08:56,664
Some protective oils for our guests and a little suntan.

324
01:08:57,022 --> 01:08:58,591
Ha ha! This is the life.

325
01:09:00,114 --> 01:09:05,438
Hey mister, would you call the ladies off?
I'm frightened what they might do to me.

326
01:09:05,619 --> 01:09:07,142
But you look charming, sir. Charming.

327
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:08,971
That's what I'm frightened of.

328
01:09:16,266 --> 01:09:18,312
Please get me out of here! I'm done to a turn!

329
01:09:18,641 --> 01:09:19,700
Clothes reviver.

330
01:09:20,027 --> 01:09:21,325
My clothes don't need reviving!

331
01:09:21,556 --> 01:09:27,987
Oh, while we're about it, sir... and off.

332
01:09:33,898 --> 01:09:36,705
Oh, Doctor. You look gorgeous!

333
01:09:36,991 --> 01:09:38,202
Oh, my shoes!

334
01:09:38,384 --> 01:09:40,503
Oh, they're fantastic. You can see your face in them.

335
01:09:40,698 --> 01:09:44,006
Precisely. Who wants to see their face
in a pair of suede shoes?

336
01:09:44,356 --> 01:09:45,310
What's this one?

337
01:09:45,513 --> 01:09:48,557
Oh, that, sir, is our rough and tumble machine,
for toning up the muscles.

338
01:09:48,765 --> 01:09:50,308
Exactly what I need!

339
01:09:50,408 --> 01:09:51,277
Full on!

340
01:09:51,371 --> 01:09:52,556
Oh, but no, sir! No!

341
01:09:52,811 --> 01:09:54,084
