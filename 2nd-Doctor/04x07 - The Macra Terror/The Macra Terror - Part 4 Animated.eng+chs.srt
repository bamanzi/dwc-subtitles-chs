Doctor, what could be happening to Jamie now?

I hate to think.
It won't be anything very pleasant.

Plus must be made minus and minus must be made plus.

00:02:04,485 --> 00:02:06,000
What's the matter?

18
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:08,149
The question is which is plus
and which is minus?

19
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,159
Ooh.

25
00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:47,189
Well, according to my calculations,
the pressure gauges are wrong.

26
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:48,491
Don't be ridiculous.

I think you'll have to agree with me.

33
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:05,263
That's the... That controls the inflow system.
那是...那东西控制着流入系统

34
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:07,486
Oh. So these are the inflow pipes, are they?

That's all I wanted to know.
我就想知道这个

36
00:03:09,278 --> 00:03:10,242

Doctor, what are you doing?

Oh, yes I have.

I can stand an operation on its head
quicker than anyone. There!

44
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:29,931
I think you'll find I've revolutionised
the entire gas flow of the Colony.
我想你会发现我已经革新了这个殖民地的整个瓦斯流向

45
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:32,429
You must be mad. You'll be locked up.
你肯定疯了, 你会被关起来的

46
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,247
Polly, see what those dials register now.
Polly, 现在去看看那些仪表读数

47
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:37,114
Right. Doctor?

What does it read?

51
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:42,877
- Full pressure.
- Good. Splendid.
- 满压  - 好, 非常好

52
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:44,876
That means there'll be
a fine old gale of fresh air...
这意味着将有一大股冷空气

53
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:46,876
blowing along the old shaft any time now.
很快将沿着旧竖井吹过去

54

You can do nothing.
You'll only delay matters.

It's a simple matter for me to reconnect the gas.
我要重新连通瓦斯是很简单的事情

Yes, I'm sure it is.
But I'm sure you'd like a little help.
是的, 我确信是这样. 但我也确信你需要一点点帮助

59
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:21,862
Now stop that.
You've enough to answer for already.
现在别再瞎说了. 你已经有足够多的问题要回答了

60
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:26,427
Guard! Guard!

61
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,852
It's all right, Polly.
I've got his keys. Lock the door.

00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:07,927
This is Control.
Why has the outflow of gas stopped?
这里是管理员. 为什么流出的瓦斯停下来了?

68
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:10,727
Gas must be pumped into the old shaft
without interruption.
瓦斯必须泵入到旧竖井里面, 不得间断

69
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:13,327

70
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,813
I need help immediately.
The strangers obey nothing.

They are turning taps in the wrong direction.

Come on, Polly. Let's get out of here.

Then use the keys. Quick, Doctor. Quick!

- Where are we?  - Well...

92
00:06:27,342 --> 00:06:29,597
It looks rather like a cupboard
with a lot of pipes.

Where do you suppose they lead?
你觉得它们通向哪里?

94
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:35,604
They must lead somewhere. Let's have a look.
它们肯定通向某个地方. 我们去看看

95
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:43,536
Doctor, I think these are the pipes
that carry the poisonous gas.

of my life with a lot of old pipes.
待在这里? 我可以不打算跟一大堆破管子共度余生

- 但是博士...  - 现在, 过来吧, Polly

in the first place, Polly.

Shh. They might hear you.

with the gas they need,

Doctor, we've got to bring the Pilot here.

In here. In the hall, Pilot.

I'm criticising the running of the pits.

But that is my job, Ola.

this stranger would still be
a danger to all of us.

there is no discipline in the pits.

That's not the only report that

your authority in this colony has gone to pieces.
