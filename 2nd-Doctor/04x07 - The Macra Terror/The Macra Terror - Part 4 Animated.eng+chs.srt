35
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:05,263
That's the... That controls the inflow system.

Oh. So these are the inflow pipes, are they?

quicker than anyone. There!

the entire gas flow of the Colony.
我想你会发现我已经革新了这个殖民地的整个瓦斯流向

- Full pressure.
- Good. Splendid.

54
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:44,876
That means there'll be
a fine old gale of fresh air...

55
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:46,976
blowing along the old shaft any time now.

是的, 我确信是这样．但我也确信你需要一点点帮助

Guard! Guard!

This is Control.
Why has the outflow of gas stopped?
这里是管理员．为什么流出的瓦斯停下来了？

70
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:10,727
Gas must be pumped into the old shaft
without interruption.
瓦斯必须泵入到旧竖井里面，不得间断

- Where are we?  - Well...

It looks rather like a cupboard

Where do you suppose they lead?

They must lead somewhere. Let's have a look.

Doctor, I think these are the pipes
that carry the poisonous gas.

Shh. They might hear you.

with the gas they need,

In here. In the hall, Pilot.

205
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:52,687
He should never have been allowed to escape.

I'm criticising the running of the pits.

But that is my job, Ola.

this stranger would still be
a danger to all of us. 
这个异乡人仍然是我们所有人的危险

there is no discipline in the pits.

That's not the only report that

your authority in this colony has gone to pieces.
