5
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:45,027
Doctor, what could be happening to Jamie now?
博士, Jamie 现在会怎样？

6
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:47,336
I hate to think. It won't be anything very pleasant.
我不敢去想．不会有什么愉快的事情

7
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:51,336
Polly, go and see what the first dial
on the control desk registers.
Polly, 过去看看控制台上第一个读数

8
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:52,209

Zero.
零

13
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:13,281
Zero. Now I think there's only one thing for it.
Plus must be made minus and minus must be made plus.
零．现在我觉得只有一种可能．加得变成减, 减得变成加

14
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:16,000
What's the matter?
什么情况？

15
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,849
The question is which is plus and which is minus?
问题是哪个是加, 哪个是减？

16
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,159
Ooh.
噢

17
00:02:45,413 --> 00:02:46,856

Well, according to my calculations,
the pressure gauges are wrong.

23
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:57,891
Don't be ridiculous.
别瞎说了

24
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:02,329
Ridiculous? Well, that's as may be.
But, after all, three times three is nine,
瞎说？好, 也有这个可能．但, 毕竟, 3 乘 3 得 9

25
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:06,729
and if you divide by half of its own cubic capacity
to the formula, Pi over four squared,
然后如果你按这个公式用它容积的一半去除, ４π的平方

00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:08,329
I think you'll have to agree with me.

29
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:14,163
That's the... That controls the inflow system.
那是...那控制着流入系统

Oh. So these are the inflow pipes, are they?

哦．那就是这里有流入的管道, 是吧？我就想知道这个

31
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:19,142
But what are you doing?
不过你要做什么？

32
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:24,924
Inflow. Inflow. Outflow. Inflow. High pressure.
Low pressure and O-U-T spells out.
流入, 流入, 流出, 流入, 高压, 低压, 然后是 O-U-T

Doctor, what are you doing?
博士, 你在做什么？

34
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:28,131

Confusion is best left to the experts.

But... Stop it! You've no idea what you're doing.
但是...停下！你不知道你在做什么

quicker than anyone. There!
哦, 我知道．我可以从头进行操作比谁都快．那里！

00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:38,431
I think you'll find I've revolutionised
the entire gas flow of the Colony.
我想你会发现我已经革新了这个殖民地的整个瓦斯流向

38
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:40,929
You must be mad. You'll be locked up.
你肯定疯了, 你会被关起来的

39
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,747
Polly, see what those dials register now.
Polly, 现在去看看那些仪表读数

40
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:45,614
Right. Doctor? Something's happened to this one.
好的．博士？这一个出了点问题

41
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:46,787
What does it read?
它什么读数？

Full pressure.
满压

45
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:55,376
Good. Splendid. That means there'll be a fine old gale
of fresh air blowing along the old shaft any time now.
好, 非常好．这意味着很快将有一大股新鲜空气刮过旧竖井

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:12,483
Ah! Ah! Let go! No! Let... Not yet, you're not.
啊！啊！放开！不！放...还不要, 你不是

47
00:04:19,587 --> 00:04:24,381
You can do nothing. You'll only delay matters.
It's a simple matter for me to reconnect the gas.
你什么也做不了, 只会延误事情fixme．我要重新连接这些瓦斯是件很简单的事情

48
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:26,439
Yes, I'm sure it is. But I'm sure you'd like a little help.
是的, 我确信是这样．但我也确信你需要一点点帮助

The only thing we can do for Jamie now
is to give him time. Lock the door.
现在我们唯一能为 Jamie 做的, 就是给他时间．锁上门

56

This is Control. Why has the outflow of gas stopped?
这里是管理员．为什么流出的瓦斯停下来了？

57
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:23,197
Gas must be pumped into the old shaft without interruption.
Begin pumping immediately.
瓦斯必须不间断地泵入到旧竖井里面．立即开始抽取

58
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:29,583
I need help immediately. The strangers obey nothing.
They are turning taps in the wrong direction.
我急需帮助．异乡人什么都不服从．他们把阀门都转了向

59
00:05:29,818 --> 00:05:31,653
Guards have been detailed to assist you.

Open up in there or we'll smash it in.

Then use the keys. Quick, Doctor. Quick!

80
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:41,050
Where do you suppose they lead?

They must lead somewhere. Let's have a look.

Doctor, I think these are the pipes
that carry the poisonous gas.

Where did this boy come from?

141
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:12,573
Oh, he's one of the dancers.
哦, 他是跳舞队的一员

142
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:18,537
Nonsense. He's the escaped stranger. You there

胡说．他是个逃跑的异乡人．你 - 指认一下, 这是你报告的那个男孩吗？

Ben, you gave me away.

his friends as well.

Repeat, no permission.

They are not to cover the exit to the old shaft.

This is in use at this moment by Control.
No one is to go near the old shaft.

No. Don't leave me.

The search for the other strangers must be carried on.

The Controller. The voice behind the screen.
管理员．声音在屏幕后面

157
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:05,528
All guards are detailed to hunt for the Doctor

所有警卫都派去搜寻博士和那个女孩儿．无论死活, 必须找到

Look! He must be there.

in the emergency gas shaft.

必须保持瓦斯压力．没有瓦斯殖民地无法存活！

So that's where all the gas goes.
看来所有瓦斯都去了那里

162
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:40,576
Yes. Just as I thought. These creatures would die without it.
是的, 如我说料．没有它们这些生物就会死

163
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:45,381
But how long have they been there? I mean,
they weren't always in control, were they?
但它们在那里多久了？我是说, 它们不是一直都在fixme

164
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:51,334
I couldn't tell you when they were here
in the first place, Polly.
我无法告诉你它们一开始是什么时候在这里的, Polly

165
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:52,934
They're like germs in the human body.
它们就像人类身体内的细菌一样

166
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,834
They've got into the body of this colony.
They're living as parasites.

00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:00,433
Polly, that's what I think they are.
Polly, 我觉得它们就是那样

169
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:05,830
They're in the control room.
It must be like getting into the brain, mustn't it?
它们在控制室里面, 这肯定就像是钻进大脑一样, 是不是

170
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:08,347
Yes. Very likely.
是, 非常可能

171
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:14,659
Shh. They might hear you.
嘘, 它们可能会听到你

172
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:20,541
Now then. One system must provide them with the gas they need, 
and the other one must be an outflow.
现在，一个系统肯定是给它们提供所需的瓦斯的，另一个肯定是排出口

173
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:25,486
Doctor, we've got to bring the Pilot here. 
Then we can show him these creatures really do exist.
博士，我们得带领航员到这里来。然后展示给他看这些生物真的存在

174
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:29,134
Yes, Polly, I think it might work.

Look at me when I talk to you.

Ola, a word with you.
Where exactly did you catch him?

177
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:38,803
In here. In the hall, Pilot.
在这里，大厅里，领航员

178
00:12:39,228 --> 00:12:41,136
I see. So, in fact, he gave himself up?
我明白了，这么说，事实上，他是自首的？

179
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:43,157
He should never have been allowed to escape.
本来就不应该允许他逃跑

180
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:45,109
Are you criticising Control?
你是在批评管理员吗？

181
00:12:45,327 --> 00:12:46,815
I'm criticising the running of the pits.
我是在批评矿坑的运作

182
00:12:47,022 --> 00:12:48,421
But that is my job, Ola.
但那是我的工作，Ola

183
00:12:48,608 --> 00:12:52,953
I know that. But were it not for my guards, 
this stranger would still be a danger to all of us. 
我知道。但如果不是我的警卫，这个异乡人仍然是我们所有人的危险


183
00:12:53,058 --> 00:12:56,653
I am going to report to Control that
there is no discipline in the pits.
我要向管理员报告，矿坑毫无纪律

184
00:12:56,827 --> 00:12:57,875
That's not the only report that Control will get!
那可不是管理员会收到的唯一一份报告！

185
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:00,942
Ever since these strangers arrived 
your authority in this colony has gone to pieces. 
自从这些异乡人的到来，你在这个殖民地的权威已经崩溃了


185
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:04,742
They come and go as they please, 
and even now two of them are still missing.
他们想来就来，想走就走，就是到现在他们还有两个人不知去向

Well, everyone is up bright and early. 
早上好，早上好，早上好。好，每个人都早早起床了

Oh, come now. 
最后两个异乡人也没有失踪。哦，现在来吧

00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:16,383
You can't have bad temper and differences of opinion
in this happy type colony. 
在这个幸福的殖民地，你不可能会有坏脾气和不同意见

186
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:20,383
Say you're sorry, Ola. Say you're sorry, Pilot.
说你很抱歉，Ola。说你很抱歉，领航员

187
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,704
Doctor, what did ye come here for? 
You've walked into a trap.
博士，你来这里做什么？你走进了陷阱里了

Good morning, Jamie. 
Nice to see you so well cared for.

Yes, but Doctor...

190

to have a word with my old friend, the Pilot. 
哦，没事的。我只是进来跟我们的老朋友，领航员，说两句话

Why did not your guards arrest these strangers?
为什么你的警卫不把这些异乡人逮捕起来？

193
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:39,849
I don't know. Guards, arrest them!
我不知道。警卫们，逮捕他们！

194
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,455
That is no longer necessary.
不在有这个必要了

195
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:44,563
Of course not. You can't arrest us
now we've given ourselves up.
当然没有。现在我们都投降了，你不能逮捕我们

195
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:46,063

what the Doctor's got to tell you.
不，等等。你必须听听博士要告诉你的事情

200
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:11,612

All the strangers!

00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:29,650
That doesn't sound like a man in control.

What did you wish to tell me?

Or very foolish. What is it you wanted to tell me?

他一会儿就会回来，而且 Ben 现在似乎也没事了

The strangers have changed him!

You haven't been in touch with Control, but with these.
跟你们接触的不是什么管理员，而是这些
