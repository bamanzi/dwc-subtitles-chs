1
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:15,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,238
Keep away. Don't touch me. I'll obey.

3
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:54,501
What's that? What's happening!

4
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:58,843
Doctor, that was it - that thing in the picture! That was the claw! They're in control.

5
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:00,557
Take them out of here. They're condemned to the pits.

6
00:01:00,731 --> 00:01:03,161
Come on. Get out, all of you. Out! Get out!

7
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,269
Stand by work shift. Stand by in the pits.

8
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:09,018
Work shift standing by.

9
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:12,678
The strangers are being sent to you for pit labour. Put them in the Danger Gang.

10
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:23,422
Your orders are correct, Pilot. The strangers must be sent to explore the new gas reserves. They are dangerous people. They must be disciplined.

11
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:24,642
Yes, Control.

12
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,971
You will forget all that happened.

13
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:28,262
Yes, Control.

14
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:34,383
The Colony enjoys hard work and happiness. We will not tolerate the evil of such strangers.

15
00:01:34,563 --> 00:01:42,869
Yes, Control. You must serve the Colony. Keep watch on your friends, and if you see anything suspicious, report to me immediately.

16
00:01:43,309 --> 00:01:44,204
Yes, Pilot.

17
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:59,614
We are all happy to work. We are all happy to work. For the good of the Colony. Happy to work. Happy to work.

18
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:00,528
Ooh!

19
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:02,290
What's the matter?

20
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:07,802
Dreadful. Did you hear that rhyme? The man who wrote that ought to be sent to the Danger Gang - not us. Ha, ha, ha.

21
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:09,157
All right. That's enough.

22
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:12,299
Ah, are these the three strangers?

23
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:13,292
Yes.

24
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:15,188
Yes, you might call us that.

25
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:17,589
They've been allocated 176 shift.

26
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:21,321
Oh, very good, Ola. I'll... I'll recall the shift leader.

27
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:28,422
What an extremely remarkable place. What efficiency. What ever do you make?

28
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:29,135
Silence.

29
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:31,831
I thought this was a mine. You know, where you dig up coal?

30
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:39,203
Ah, yes. But here, you see, the rock foundation is a type of salt. Now, at depths it generates gases over the years, and these gases are extremely valuable.

31
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:42,054
Don't bother to explain to them. Just get them to work.

32
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:45,120
Aye. Well, you don't send a lassie and an old man down to dig.

33
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:46,987
Old? What do you mean old? I'm not old, Jamie.

34
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:48,092
You'll do as you're ordered.

35
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:50,021
Here's the leader of their shift, sir.

36
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:53,706
Very well. Report any irregularities to me.

37
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:56,805
Medok. How did you get here?

38
00:02:56,994 --> 00:03:00,479
Huh! They threw me out of the correction hospital. Apparently I'm a hopeless case.

39
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:01,948
But why did they send you here?

40
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:05,272
The one remaining punishment they could think of - to work in the Danger Gang for life.

41
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:06,080
For life?

42
00:03:06,345 --> 00:03:14,347
Oh, don't worry. You don't survive long in this atmosphere. It's the gas. It gets everywhere. It creeps into your lungs. And when you're down there, you're right in the thick of it.

43
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,142
Come on, Medok. Take them to their work.

44
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:17,571
What's the hurry?

45
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:19,123
You don't want me to call the guard, do you?

46
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:23,516
All right. All right. We're going. But, we are entitled to a supervisor on this shift.

47
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:25,043
Ah, yes. That's true.

48
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,032
Yes. Well, I'm leaving this man.

49
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,158
Hmm? Oh. Well, yes. I suppose that's all right.

50
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:33,303
But, it's much safer up here. Isn't it, Medok?

51
00:03:33,494 --> 00:03:34,286
It is.

52
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:40,778
Ah, I see. I'm perfectly capable of working in the pit, thank you. Polly can have the safe job.

53
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,685
Uh, no. You stay up here. I wouldn't know what to do.

54
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,867
Well, I'm not sure I understand all this machinery myself.

55
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:49,180
Do you not think you might make better use of the opportunity, Doctor?

56
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,191
What do you mean? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes. I'll be supervisor.

57
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:55,812
What was all that?

58
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:57,683
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

59
00:03:57,883 --> 00:03:58,983
Come on you two.

60
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:05,201
Oh, you're going to issue them with masks, aren't you? You aren't taking them down there without any protection?

61
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:15,294
Surely you could have seen to that? Oh, ah, here. You'd better take this, um... this checklist.

62
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:18,477
But I... I would have liked a mask.

63
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:33,067
This really is remarkable. Most interesting. Yes. I suppose with a little adjustment...

64
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:38,921
Hello, Ben. Don't go. Come in. Don't be afraid.

65
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,171
I have nothing to be afraid of.

66
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:46,929
No. Of course not. It wasn't your fault you betrayed your friends.

67
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:48,903
The voices tell me what to do.

68
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:51,657
The voices may not be right, Ben.

69
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:53,174
I do what I am told.

70
00:04:53,421 --> 00:05:11,648
Yes, I know. That's why you're here, isn't it? To spy on me. What does Control want to know this time? Won't you answer me? You know, Ben, this is very unlike you.

71
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:18,503
I don't know what you mean. It is my duty.

72
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:29,299
Hard for you to struggle against the voices, isn't it, Ben? I warn you, if you spy on the others, watch out Jamie doesn't catch you. He's not so tolerant as I am.

73
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:37,041
Hurry up. Put on your equipment.

74
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:39,789
You shouldn't make lasses do the work of men.

75
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:43,229
The Danger Gang will do as they are told. It's a punishment for their failure to cooperate.

76
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:46,673
We do all the dirty work. We go where the gas is worst.

77
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:49,592
It's your own fault, Medok. If you obeyed Control...

78
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:54,921
All right. All right. Forget it. I prefer Control poisoning my lungs, to their trying to poison my mind.

79
00:05:55,132 --> 00:05:57,015
What's that?

80
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:58,530
It's a gas strike.

81
00:05:58,823 --> 00:06:02,929
Go on! Help with the cable there. Go on. Hurry up. That's the alarm.

82
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:05,197
What does he mean?

83
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,527
He means they've struck so much gas, they can't channel it off. When it reaches a certain density, that alarm bell goes.

84
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:12,500
Hurry up! Get that cable to the strike.

85
00:06:12,802 --> 00:06:13,360
Come on. Quickly.

86
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:24,774
Quickly. Come on. Pull there. Pull, all of you. Pull. Pull.

87
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:25,753
Polly!

88
00:06:25,973 --> 00:06:29,077
Leave her. Get that cable to the strike.

89
00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:56,287
Get her away from here. Away. Jamie, the head of the cable. Got it? Right. Put your masks on. They're in your pocket. Right. Now, help me with this. Hold it. Hold it, Jamie. Right.

90
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:05,302
What's it all for?

91
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:14,872
It's a poisonous gas which we mine, from the bowels of this planet, which kills us if we breathe it. No one knows what it's used for.

92
00:07:33,843 --> 00:08:23,021
Yes. Now, one must assume that the relative connection is constant. Now, let me see. Ah! Yes. I think that's right. I should give myself ten out of ten.

93
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:27,730
Oh, you did give me a turn.

94
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,510
Where did you find it?

95
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,478
What?

96
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:31,542
The formula.

97
00:08:32,238 --> 00:08:34,401
In my head. You know.

98
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:37,959
Don't lie. That is a secret known only to three people in the Colony.

99
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:39,791
And you're one of them?

100
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:47,935
Naturally. And you're not asking me to believe that in a few moments you have been able to work out a formula which it has taken our combined computers years to perfect?

101
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:49,972
It does seem rather a tall order.

102
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:56,182
Yes, of course. I know what you've done. You've broken into our secret files, haven't you?

103
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:58,287
I wouldn't know how to do that. Take a look.

104
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:02,605
Well, you must have seen the document. That's the exact computation.

105
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:05,239
Really? Huh. In that case...

106
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:11,942
Do you really mean to say that you worked that out by yourself?

107
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,406
Well, I did have a little assistance.

108
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,268
Yes, I thought so. Who was it?

109
00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:28,981
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. No person. No. I simply mean that I took readings from the various dials. They appeared to be related, so I worked out the principle that controls them. It was simple really. Like doing a sum backwards.

110
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:30,422
Backwards?

111
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,062
Yes. You know. Given the answer, what's the question?

112
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,373
Wipe it away. Get it off there before anybody else sees it.

113
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:40,207
Oh, well. If you insist.

114
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:50,279
Ho, ho. There now. If anyone follows that formula, there'll be an almighty explosion x to the power of y is derivative 2 3's of 6!

115
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,357
Get it off.

116
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:04,442
What are they doing?

117
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:06,154
We call that probing.

118
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,784
They're not looking for more gas?

119
00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:09,400
Oh, yes. We never stop!

120
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:12,494
There's a door here. Where's it lead to?

121
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:15,944
I've no idea. To my knowledge, those doors were never opened.

122
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,325
Could be an old shaft.

123
00:10:17,914 --> 00:10:20,692
Why would it need such a new door? And so strong?

124
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:22,522
Hey, look out!

125
00:10:23,085 --> 00:10:24,529
Ah, you've made the connection?

126
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:27,099
Of course. Otherwise you wouldn't be here.

127
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:31,181
Now, be careful, Medok. There are other places worse than the Danger Gang, you know.

128
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:34,765
This is a high pressure strike. You are going to need a stronger screw than this.

129
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:35,677
Don't touch it.

130
00:10:35,898 --> 00:10:37,207
I know what I'm doing.

131
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,387
He's fainted.

132
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,233
Aye. He must have.

133
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:46,993
What's the matter? What has happened to him?

134
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,340
He's had a wee whiff of the gas.

135
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:00,765
Get him up. I'll look after him. Yeah. It's all right, mate. Hang on.

136
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,242
How long do you think Ben was watching us?

137
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:07,432
I don't know.

138
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,928
Do you think he saw you take the keys?

139
00:11:09,207 --> 00:11:10,133
Well, if he did, we're in trouble.

140
00:11:10,364 --> 00:11:10,931
Yes.

141
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:12,662
It just means we'll have to make use of them quick as we can.

142
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:14,390
But where, Jamie. And how?

143
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:16,073
Let's try that wee door first. Come on.

144
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:20,898
Give me the word if anybody comes.

145
00:11:21,231 --> 00:11:28,149
Right. Lookout, OK.

146
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:33,982
Hey, you two, give us a hand.

147
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:38,785
Um, all right. I'd better go.

148
00:11:38,995 --> 00:11:40,694
Just a minute Polly. This key's turning. Oh.

149
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:42,273
Good luck.

150
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:45,398
Aye. It fits. Come on, Pol.

151
00:11:50,286 --> 00:11:52,236
Come on. Here everybody. Lend a hand.

152
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:09,589
What's that?

153
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:11,995
It's impossible.

154
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:13,560
Is it more gas?

155
00:12:13,796 --> 00:12:18,309
No. It's an escape. That bell means that someone has escaped down here.

156
00:12:18,507 --> 00:12:19,343
It's Jamie.

157
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:22,274
Your friend? That door! I'm going with him.

158
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:25,625
Hey wait! Don't leave me down here.

159
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:45,465
We couldn't have an alarm. It's impossible. No one ever escapes. Calling Pit Guard. Close exits to all gas shafts. Stand by. A prisoner has escaped. Shoot on sight.

160
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:47,693
But, if no one can escape...

161
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:52,559
My keys! My keys! They were on my tunic.

162
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:55,360
You must have dropped them.

163
00:12:55,971 --> 00:13:04,046
Special guards to cover all exits to the old shaft. With Pilot's permission, they may have to go on forbidden ground.

164
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:34,381
Jamie? Jamie? Jamie? Ah!

165
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:43,003
Hello? Who's there?

166
00:13:49,857 --> 00:14:04,919
No permission is granted for the guard to go on forbidden ground. Repeat, no permission. They are not to cover the exit to the old shaft. This is in use at this moment by Control. No one is to go in or near the old shaft. Top priority.

167
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:08,444
They seem very emphatic about that.

168
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:10,380
Control knows best.

169
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:15,041
But what if your prisoner escapes that way? What will happen to you?

170
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:16,270
I shall be punished.

171
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:18,823
Well, aren't you going to do something about it?

172
00:14:19,824 --> 00:14:22,125
Control knows best.

173
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:24,710
Who has escaped anyway?

174
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:27,263
We shall soon find out.

175
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:33,386
It is Jamie.

176
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:36,233
How do you know that, Ben?

177
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:38,433
I saw him take the keys.

178
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,137
And you didn't report it?

179
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,356
No.

180
00:14:42,644 --> 00:14:43,381
Why not?

181
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:48,670
I don't know. I don't seem to be able to think straight.

182
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:53,817
Ben, you're recovering. I always thought you were a tough customer. Well done!

183
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:57,411
Control knows best.

184
00:14:57,762 --> 00:14:59,174
You don't seem very sure.

185
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:02,752
Jamie took those keys. I must report him!

186
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:03,438
Doctor, you know what's happened?

187
00:16:04,593 --> 00:16:08,141
Yes. Jamie's got free. By my calculations he's got a very good chance. Hold that for me, will you?

188
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:09,548
What do you mean?

189
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:12,113
Well, as I understand it, Jamie's in the old shaft.

190
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:12,948
Yes. That's right.

191
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:17,805
And for reasons of their own, Control don't want anyone there. It's forbidden territory.

192
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:19,163
So you think he'll be all right?

193
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:23,093
I don't know. I'll be able to tell you when I've tested this to see how lethal it is.

194
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:25,692
But what's that got to do with Jamie?

195
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:32,007
On this planet it's got a lot to do with everybody. There now. Yes.

196
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,906
Oh, Doctor. What on earth are you doing?

197
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:41,454
I'm trying to analyse this gas, and I'm not having very much luck.

198
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:44,104
Is that the same stuff that we've been pumping out of the pits?

199
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,909
Yes. And they go to great efforts to get it. The question is why?

200
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,369
Ssh! Somebody's coming.

201
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:51,132
Ooh! Mustn't find this.

202
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:59,217
Oh, the Pilot's not here. Let me help you.

203
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:00,517
No.

204
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:04,105
Always lend a helping hand. A willing friend makes the task lighter.

205
00:17:04,335 --> 00:17:07,885
I'll wait for the Pilot. If I'm going to tell anybody...

206
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,627
You are, aren't you?

207
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:18,311
I don't know what I'm going to do. I got these voices in my head. Sometimes I just think I'm having a bad dream.

208
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:21,736
But the voices are here to help us. They are our friends.

209
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:27,285
That's it. What about my friends?

210
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:58,041
I'll see you are reported for this. If this were not an emergency...

211
00:17:58,706 --> 00:18:01,186
The bell stopped. Why has it stopped?

212
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:03,705
Because, young lady, the emergency is over.

213
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:06,760
Does that mean he's been caught?

214
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,773
It means they're closing in on him.

215
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:23,043
Thank you. But, why didn't you tell this to Officia?

216
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,181
You told me to report back to you.

217
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:32,661
I see. Very well. The stranger who has escaped is in the old shaft. Control will now give instructions.

218
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:49,614
All guards will leave the area of the old shaft. No one must go near it, even in search of the stranger. Do not approach its exit or entrance. Do not go in. Officials are to stand by at the gas centre.

219
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,242
We will obey, Control.

220
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:56,998
Gas centre standing by. What transfers do you wish made?

221
00:18:57,197 --> 00:19:02,872
Prepare for gas to be diverted into the old shaft. Inspect connection immediately and report back.

222
00:19:09,947 --> 00:19:12,202
The old shaft. Doctor, that's where Jamie is!

223
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:18,663
They're going to pour this gas in the old shaft - gas they value above all else. What do you make of that, Polly?

224
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:21,088
For goodness sake, Doctor. What are you going on about?

225
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:28,775
Don't you see? Control are not pouring this poisonous gas into the old shaft to kill Jamie. They've quite another reason.

226
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,984
Doctor, you've got to do something to help him.

227
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:54,659
Before we act, we must think. Now, the Macra that have come to the surface of this planet have not found sufficient gas in the atmosphere, so they've had to get somebody to pump it up from down below.

228
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:58,878
But, if it's life and death to them, why do they waste it? Why divert it into the old shaft?

229
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,539
That's obvious, Polly. Obvious. Because there's something trapped down there they wish to keep alive.

230
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:31,228
Officia reporting. All connections have been tested. They are all one hundred percent serviceable. Transfer of all gases may now be made to the old shaft.

231
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:34,789
Stand by for action.

232
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:44,506
The Colony. The Colony is happy to obey. The Colony is happy to obey.

233
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,703
We've got to help him.

234
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:52,063
I'm doing my best, Polly. I'm thinking at top speed. There's a pattern involved here - a combination of pipes. If one were to follow this one...

235
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:59,649
Stand by gas Officia. All flow is to be channelled through systems seven and eleven.

236
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:01,641
Seven and eleven. Now which are they?

237
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,748
All channels are ready.

238
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:06,472
Prepare to turn on at half blast.

239
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:08,189
All ready.

240
00:21:08,495 --> 00:21:09,447
Now!

241
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:37,728
Seven and eleven. If that's the system in use, it must go from here round up to there.

242
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:40,443
Officia is to increase pressure.

243
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:42,669
Doctor, quickly.

244
00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:44,719
Polly, I think I've found the gas flow.

245
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,580
The pressure's being increased.

246
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:11,682
Turn on full pressure now.

247
00:22:13,103 --> 00:22:15,372
Full pressure in action!
