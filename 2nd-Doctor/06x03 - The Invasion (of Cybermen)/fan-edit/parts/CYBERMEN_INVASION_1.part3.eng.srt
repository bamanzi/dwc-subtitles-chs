1
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:19,920
How long ago did they go in?

2
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,156
BENTON: <i>Some time ago, sir.</i>

3
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:24,205
<i>Tracy followed them as far as the official boundary</i>
<i>of the railway sidings.</i>

4
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:25,720
<i>They went in about an hour ago.</i>

5
00:22:25,807 --> 00:22:28,002
-Is Tracy still round there?
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

6
00:22:28,087 --> 00:22:29,759
-Right, stick around for a while.
<i>-Just a minute, sir.</i>

7
00:22:29,847 --> 00:22:30,996
Yes, what is it, Benton?

8
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:33,965
<i>The Doctor and the boy.</i>
<i>They're coming out, sir, with Vaughn.</i>

9
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:47,105
<i>They've all got into Vaughn's private car.</i>

10
00:22:47,187 --> 00:22:48,905
<i>Oh, they're driving off, sir.</i>

11
00:22:48,987 --> 00:22:50,181
Is any force being used?

12
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:53,543
<i>No. Not that I can see. Packer was there,</i>
<i>but it all seemed very friendly to me.</i>

13
00:22:53,627 --> 00:22:54,742
<i>Shall we follow?</i>

14
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:57,102
No, I'll have them tracked more discreetly.

15
00:22:57,187 --> 00:23:00,145
-Over and out. Sergeant Walters.
-Yes, sir?

16
00:23:00,227 --> 00:23:03,458
-Alert all area patrols in section three.
-Yes, sir.

17
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:07,096
-Did you hear all that, Jimmy?
-I did, sir.

18
00:23:07,087 --> 00:23:10,284
Look, we'll get you aboard a chopper,
and you can rendezvous with the tracking agent.

19
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:11,376
All right, sir.

20
00:23:32,347 --> 00:23:34,258
(ROTORS WHIRRING)

21
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:40,487
Yes, they've just gone into the IE area, sir.
Shall I follow?

22
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:45,277
No, circle the area. We can't really do anything
until we get a request from the Doctor.

23
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:48,120
<i>-Standing by, sir.</i>
-And, Jimmy, keep out of sight.

24
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:50,960
If Vaughn's private army see you,
they might well get the wind up,

25
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:54,278
and that might make things rather unhealthy
for the Doctor and the boy.

26
00:23:57,747 --> 00:23:58,816
Hey!

27
00:24:03,147 --> 00:24:05,786
-Doctor, it's...
-Confusing, isn't it?

28
00:24:06,107 --> 00:24:08,063
It's exactly the same as your office in London.

29
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:10,377
In all basic essentials, yes, it is.

30
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:12,219
That's the secret of my success, you see.

31
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:14,263
Uniformity. Duplication.

32
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:16,584
My whole empire is based on that principle.

33
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,419
The very essence of business efficiency.

34
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:20,975
-Do sit down.
-DOCTOR: Oh, how kind.

35
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:29,176
I must say I'm rather glad
we have this opportunity to talk.

36
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,461
Really?

37
00:24:31,507 --> 00:24:34,305
I should, of course, be angry with you.

38
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:38,422
You've thwarted
my elaborate security precautions twice.

39
00:24:38,747 --> 00:24:40,977
-I'd like to know why.
-Oh, that's quite simple.

40
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:44,298
I hate computers
and refuse to be bullied by them.

41
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:46,096
Your young friend Zoe.

42
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:49,020
-Well, what about her?
-Well, she appears to have the same instincts.

43
00:24:49,107 --> 00:24:52,019
She so confused one of my computers
she ruined its memory store.

44
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:55,417
So that's why your thugs dragged her
and Isobel away.

45
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:58,021
My dear young man, I wasn't angry with her.

46
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:02,703
On the contrary, I found the incident
quite amusing. She's a remarkable girl.

47
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:07,579
And you, Doctor, are obviously a man
of no mean scientific ability.

48
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:09,016
Why do you say that?

49
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:12,577
Well, my research department
found these quite fascinating.

50
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:16,023
There's a totally illogical factor
in their construction.

51
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:18,663
Are they of your own invention?

52
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:23,743
Ah, you're determined to guard your secret, I see.

53
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:28,502
I don't blame you,
and I promise not to pry any more.

54
00:25:29,507 --> 00:25:33,056
-In fact, I'll do all I can to help you.
-Oh, how kind.

55
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,017
Now, you say you came here
looking for Professor Watkins

56
00:25:36,107 --> 00:25:37,665
because you thought he might be able to help you.

57
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:38,782
Yes.

58
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:42,337
Well, then I'll try to persuade him
to put aside his work and, um,

59
00:25:42,427 --> 00:25:44,782
concentrate his efforts on your behalf.

60
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,698
Make yourself at home.

61
00:25:51,907 --> 00:25:55,183
Hey, look, you're not going to trust him, are you?
I mean, what about Zoe and Isobel?

62
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:56,905
I haven't forgotten them, Jamie.

63
00:25:56,987 --> 00:25:58,864
They're in that box. I'm sure of it.

64
00:25:58,947 --> 00:26:02,064
Jamie, we're not going to help Zoe
by annoying Mr Vaughn, are we?

65
00:26:02,147 --> 00:26:04,217
I don't think you can annoy that man
even if you wanted to.

66
00:26:04,307 --> 00:26:05,786
He's being as nice as pie.

67
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:06,902
He's too nice.

68
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:08,864
-Yeah, but why should he be?
-I don't know.

69
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:11,984
He's a little bit too interested in these circuits
for my liking.

70
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:14,501
Hey, do you think he knows
about the Tardis, then?

71
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:17,740
Well, I don't see how he could do.

72
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:22,457
No, well, perhaps this Professor Watkins
will be able to tell us what's going on around here.

73
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:25,460
-Yes, but that's what's worrying me.
-What?

74
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:29,666
Well, if Vaughn has anything to hide,
why is he letting us talk to Watkins?

75
00:26:30,427 --> 00:26:33,783
I'd think about it if I were you, Professor.
After all, she is a pretty girl.

76
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:35,539
It'd be a shame to spoil all that.

77
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,460
What a vicious sadist you are, Packer.

78
00:26:40,027 --> 00:26:42,143
I don't believe you, anyway.

79
00:26:42,987 --> 00:26:45,296
I don't make idle threats, Professor,
as you well know.

80
00:26:45,387 --> 00:26:48,538
If you want to see that girl again in one piece,
I suggest you do as Mr Vaughn asks.

81
00:26:48,627 --> 00:26:52,097
How do I know that you already
haven't harmed her? If you had got her...

82
00:26:52,187 --> 00:26:54,701
You can take my word for that, Professor.

83
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,140
(LAUGHING) Your word.

84
00:26:56,227 --> 00:26:58,695
I know just how much value I can place on that.

85
00:26:58,787 --> 00:27:01,347
Harsh words, Professor, harsh words.

86
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:05,586
Any progress?

87
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:11,540
-So you haven't yet completed the machine?
-No, and I don't intend to.

88
00:27:11,627 --> 00:27:13,936
Oh, I think you will, Professor.

89
00:27:14,027 --> 00:27:15,983
Much as I detest violence,

90
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:20,777
I find it difficult to restrain Packer's
indisputable talent for persuasion.

91
00:27:22,427 --> 00:27:24,338
Your niece is in our custody,

92
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:28,181
and unless you do as I ask,
I shall hand her over to Packer.

93
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:30,579
The choice is yours.

94
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:37,181
If I do cooperate, will you let her go?

95
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:41,739
Oh, no, she's our guarantee,
but she'll come to no harm.

96
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:44,986
All right.

97
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:48,021
-But I must see Isobel first.
-Of course.

98
00:27:48,107 --> 00:27:50,541
Oh, there is just one other thing.

99
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,425
Don't look at me so suspiciously,
my dear Professor.

100
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:56,067
It's merely that there are some friends of yours
here who wish to see you.

101
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:59,503
-Friends?
-Yes, they've gone to great pains to seek you out.

102
00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:02,340
But I haven't been allowed visitors
since I came here.

103
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:04,782
Why are you suddenly considerate?

104
00:28:04,867 --> 00:28:06,823
I might tell them everything.

105
00:28:06,907 --> 00:28:08,499
Everything?

106
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:11,260
My dear Professor,
you know nothing that can harm me.

107
00:28:11,347 --> 00:28:13,861
Besides, there's always Isobel to consider,
isn't there?

108
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:17,417
-Or would you rather leave her to me?
-Now, now, Packer.

109
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:20,544
The Professor's going to do exactly as we ask.

110
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,466
Aren't you?

111
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:25,485
Yes, of course, I remember Anne Travers
telling me about you.

112
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:27,683
She was a student of mine, you know,
some years ago.

113
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:29,325
-Brilliant girl. Brilliant.
-Yes.

114
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,638
Yes, they went to America, didn't they?

115
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:35,002
Oh, Travers was getting past it a bit, you know,

116
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:37,043
and Anne persuaded him
to go to America with her.

117
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:38,321
Oh, yes.

118
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,723
What are you doing here?

119
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:43,123
Well, it's a long story.

120
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:47,563
The strange Doctor
has been on another planet, Packer.

121
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:49,439
That's not possible!

122
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:52,078
It is a fact, Packer.

123
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:54,677
He has some sort of machine.

124
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:59,240
Now let's see if we can learn more about it,
shall we?

125
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:00,999
Switch on, Packer.

126
00:29:02,727 --> 00:29:04,080
With sound.

127
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:08,558
<i>So we went to see Mr Vaughn,</i>

128
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,444
<i>and he said that you were working</i>
<i>on something important.</i>

129
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:12,961
I see. That's why you wanted
to leave them alone together.

130
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:14,480
Exactly, Packer.

131
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:15,602
(COMMUNICATOR HUMMING)

132
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:19,236
<i>But the Doctor needed some help</i>
<i>on some electronic circuits that the Tardis had.</i>

133
00:29:19,327 --> 00:29:20,362
-Really?
-Aye, aye.

134
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:22,756
Jamie, Jamie. I don't think
the Professor wants to hear about that.

135
00:29:22,847 --> 00:29:25,919
Oh, on the contrary, what Anne told me
about the Tardis was most intriguing.

136
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:27,122
I'd like to hear a lot more about it.

137
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:29,675
Professor, I think I should warn you

138
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:33,316
that Anne Travers allowed her imagination
to run a little wild.

139
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:34,726
You mean to say that there is no such machine?

140
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:36,286
-Of course there is...
-Jamie, I think

141
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:39,086
there are other more important things
to talk about at the moment.

142
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:40,395
Oh, I see, yes.

143
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,285
Professor, tell us about what you're doing here.

144
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:45,119
Oh, it's very simple, really.

145
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:46,925
I've been developing
a new kind of teaching machine.

146
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:48,281
-Oh, yes? A teaching machine?
-What's it called?

147
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:50,676
-I call it the Cerebraton Mentor.
-Oh, aye.

148
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:54,157
The main difference
from other teaching machines is that it's able

149
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:56,886
to induce emotional changes in the subject.

150
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:58,286
JAMIE: Oh.

151
00:30:01,127 --> 00:30:03,357
Our friend the Doctor is a resourceful man.

152
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:05,677
No wonder our allies fear him.

153
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:09,436
-Our allies know him?
-Oh, yes, I was ordered to destroy him.

154
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:13,717
But first I must learn the secrets
of this extraordinary machine of his.

155
00:30:13,807 --> 00:30:18,198
-If you're ordered to destroy him...
-I don't take orders, Packer. I give them!

156
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:23,404
Now, I think the time has come
to stop playing games with this Doctor!

157
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:24,915
But what can we do?

158
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:27,396
If, as you say, they have got Isobel
and your young friend,

159
00:30:27,487 --> 00:30:28,681
then we're entirely at their mercy.

160
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:31,440
No, no, not entirely.
There's my friend the Brigadier, remember?

161
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:33,245
-Do you think he can help us?
-Possibly.

162
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:36,797
But quickly, tell me, what is Vaughn up to?
What's he doing here?

163
00:30:36,887 --> 00:30:38,798
I know no more than you do.

164
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:42,163
He's a ruthless man, without morals or principles.

165
00:30:42,447 --> 00:30:47,840
His object, I'm sure, is to get complete control
of the electronics industry of the world!

166
00:30:48,127 --> 00:30:49,480
I wonder.

167
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:53,082
I've a nasty feeling he's aiming
somewhat higher than that.

168
00:30:56,047 --> 00:30:58,436
Doctor, quick, somebody's coming.

169
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:02,318
Don't bother, Doctor.

170
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:04,726
Allow me.

171
00:31:07,687 --> 00:31:09,996
Very ingenious. A simple magnet.

172
00:31:11,087 --> 00:31:12,759
I congratulate you.

173
00:31:13,727 --> 00:31:15,160
Oh, how kind.

174
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:17,764
However, you must surely realise

175
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:20,919
that it's forced me to consider
other methods to make you talk.

176
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:22,486
What are you going to do?

177
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:25,240
Your friend Zoe is due to arrive here shortly.

178
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:27,477
So you have got her!
Listen, if you've harmed her in any...

179
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:31,082
You may still be adolescent enough
to make idle threats, young man,

180
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:33,635
but I can assure you, I am not.

181
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:39,641
I want your travel machine, Doctor.

182
00:31:40,007 --> 00:31:43,124
Otherwise, I shall hand your friend Zoe
over to Packer.

183
00:31:43,207 --> 00:31:47,962
It's a simple choice and shouldn't take you
longer than an hour to consider.

184
00:31:48,247 --> 00:31:50,158
Take them away, Packer.

185
00:31:52,407 --> 00:31:53,726
-All right.
-All right.

186
00:31:53,807 --> 00:31:56,241
Leave them to me. I'll take them.

187
00:31:56,807 --> 00:32:00,243
Now, Professor,
I suggest you continue with your work.

188
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:08,844
Oh, dear. You know, Jamie,
I've always been rather scared of lifts.

189
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,042
Why?

190
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:12,004
I never even like to start them.

191
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:13,645
You will have to push the button for me.

192
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:16,321
-Keep your mouth shut. Do as you're told.
-Yes, Jamie. Do as you're told.

193
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:18,398
-Oh, yes...
-PACKER: Be quiet!

194
00:32:18,847 --> 00:32:20,803
Packer! Mr Packer,

195
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:25,803
I obviously can't let you hurt Zoe, and so
I'll have to tell you all you want to know, now.

196
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:27,115
You mean you're willing to talk?

197
00:32:27,207 --> 00:32:28,959
Yes, I'm sure that Mr Vaughn would...

198
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,481
-Oh, there he is now...
-Quick, Doctor.

199
00:32:34,927 --> 00:32:35,916
Your knife.

200
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:37,645
Your knife. Give me your knife.

201
00:32:37,727 --> 00:32:39,843
-Why? What are you going to do?
-I'm going to try and break the circuit.

202
00:32:39,927 --> 00:32:40,996
What would that do?

203
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:43,806
Well, it will either stop the lift
or send us out of control.

204
00:32:43,887 --> 00:32:45,081
But we're six floors up.

205
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:48,716
We'll have to take that risk.
Hold tight, here we go.

206
00:32:48,807 --> 00:32:50,035
(CLATTERING)

207
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:54,718
-Why are you so gullible, Packer?
-Just wait till I get hold of them. I'll...

208
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:58,686
You'll do nothing! I want them in one piece.

209
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:02,745
-There was a 50/50 chance, you know, Jamie.
-Yes, but what good has it done us?

210
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:04,226
I mean, we're stuck here in this lift now.

211
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:06,537
No. No, it's the lift that's stuck,

212
00:33:06,627 --> 00:33:08,060
not us. Look!

213
00:33:09,627 --> 00:33:10,742
Hey, where does that lead to?

214
00:33:10,827 --> 00:33:14,137
Out into the lift shaft, I imagine.
Quickly, on me back.

215
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:17,344
You know something? You're a clever wee chappie!

216

218
00:33:25,827 --> 00:33:27,465
Thank you, Jamie.

219
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:29,706
Oh, my word!

220
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:32,736
Well, that's a long way up, isn't it?

221
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:36,024
Oh, well, we better get cracking
before they realise what's happened, eh?

222
00:33:36,107 --> 00:33:38,337
-Perhaps I'd better shut this.
-Aye.

223

(DOCTOR GRUNTS)

224
00:33:41,107 --> 00:33:43,667
Hey, Doctor, I've just been thinking.

225
00:33:43,747 --> 00:33:47,342
What happens if they get the lift going
before we get to the top?

226
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:49,065
-Oh, that's simple.
-What?

227
00:33:49,147 --> 00:33:52,344
-We get squashed.
-Oh. What! Well, come on!

228
00:33:54,427 --> 00:33:55,621
Right!

229
00:33:55,787 --> 00:33:58,255
They've switched over the circuits.
The lift's working!

230
00:33:58,347 --> 00:34:00,622
How splendid. Bring it up here.

231
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,498
Bring it up to the sixth floor.

232
00:34:04,847 --> 00:34:05,836
(CLANGING)

233
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:09,156
Hey, that's not what I think it is, is it?

234
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,761
I'm very much afraid it is. Come on!

235
00:34:20,407 --> 00:34:23,365
-We'll never make it!
-Yes, we will! Come on!

(LIFT CLATTERS)

237
00:34:27,047 --> 00:34:28,639
What's happened?

238
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:32,878
It's stopped! They must be checking.

239
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:36,579
Come on, they may guess where we are
and come after us.

240
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:37,603
The engineer's certain...

241
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:39,962
The shaft terminates in the roof,
doesn't it, Packer?

242
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:42,800
-Yes, sir.
-Why didn't you think of that?

243
00:34:43,507 --> 00:34:45,657
-I'll get them!
-Call me when you do, Packer.

244
00:34:45,747 --> 00:34:50,980
I'll be in my office. And please don't fail this time,
there's a good fellow.

245
00:34:53,707 --> 00:34:55,459
They've started it again!

246
00:34:57,867 --> 00:34:59,619
Hurry, Jamie! Hurry!

247
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,786
-Come on, Jamie.
-Wait a minute, Doctor.

248
00:35:16,187 --> 00:35:18,223
No, come on. Let's see where we are.

249
00:35:26,147 --> 00:35:28,058
-Now where?
-Down there.

250
00:35:28,987 --> 00:35:30,420
JAMIE: Oh, no!

251
00:35:30,827 --> 00:35:33,705
Well, we can't go down the lift again, can we?

252
00:35:33,787 --> 00:35:36,984
Hello. There's a fire escape. Come on.

253
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:41,896
Oh, Packer, you do disappoint me.

254
00:35:42,547 --> 00:35:43,980
They must have got down the fire escape, sir.

255
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:47,423
And, of course, you didn't think
to have a guard on that!

256
00:35:47,507 --> 00:35:49,862
-Well, normally...
-You're a stupid incompetent!

257
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,539
I want that Doctor!

258
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:55,176
Put the whole compound on alert!
Have every available guard on the job!

259
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:57,986
Find him, Packer! Find him!
