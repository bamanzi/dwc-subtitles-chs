Come on, let's go back to the canoe.

00:00:52,657 --> 00:00:53,577
What did you find out?

7
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:55,703
-Some old friends of ours are here, Zoe.
-Who?

8
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:57,823
-The Cybermen.
-Yes, I'm afraid it's true, Zoe.

9
00:00:57,907 --> 00:01:01,138
-That's what you suspected, wasn't it?
-What on Earth are Cybermen?

10
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,036
-They're from another world. Inhuman killers.

11
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:07,138
You...You're serious?

12
00:01:07,227 --> 00:01:09,616
We've met Cybermen before
and seen what they can do.

13
00:01:09,707 --> 00:01:11,140
Where exactly are they and how many?

14
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:14,902
-JAMIE: At Vaughn's headquarters in London...
-Hundreds of them, probably thousands.

15
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:16,500
ZOE: So Vaughn's helping them.

16
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:20,097
So that's what those UFOs were.
But there've been hundreds of those sightings.

17
00:01:20,187 --> 00:01:21,700
Aye, they must have quite an army by now.

18
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:24,176
-The thing is, where are they hiding them all?
-I don't know, Jamie.

19
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:26,383
-Captain, where's the Brigadier?
-At the Ministry of Defence.

20
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:28,617
I'll get on to him immediately
and tell him what you discovered.

21
00:01:28,707 --> 00:01:29,822
No, no, Captain.

22
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:31,943
The people who went into Vaughn's Headquarters

23
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:34,416
-were different when they came out, weren't they?
-Yes.

24
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:37,305
-Do you think they're been controlled, Doctor?
-Controlled?

25
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:40,584
Yes, the Cybermen have means
of controlling people's minds.

26
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,818
They appear to be almost normal,
but they're not, they're controlled.

27
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:47,946
-Who is the Brigadier immediately answerable to?
-Major-General Rutlidge.

28
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:52,259
No cause for alarm?
Billy, do you realise what's happened?

29
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:54,258
They tried to shoot down one of my helicopters.

30
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:57,498
You were trespassing over their top-security area.

31
00:01:57,587 --> 00:01:58,815
Oh, for heaven's sake.

32
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:00,579
If you can't trust a UNIT force, who can you trust?

33
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,817
There's nothing we...

34
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:08,500
-What's the matter?
-Oh. Nothing. Nothing at all.

35
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:12,136
Look, Billy, Vaughn's a powerful chap, I know that.

36
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:15,060
But surely we can at least
request a thorough investigation.

37
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:16,899
This isn't our province.

38
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:20,297
-Well, then whose province is it?
-It's no good getting angry about this.

39
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:22,457
You must see this from my point of view.

40
00:02:22,547 --> 00:02:24,697
All you've given me are vague reports,

41
00:02:24,787 --> 00:02:28,063
-nothing conclusive, no proof.
-No proof!

42
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:33,141
I'm sure this is all a misunderstanding.
I'll talk to the C in C of internal security myself.

43
00:02:33,227 --> 00:02:36,663
But, Billy, talk isn't going to help.
I want some sort of action, and I want it now.

44
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:39,022
At least get the civil authorities to investigate.

45
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:42,144
You'll have to leave this matter with me.

00:02:42,907 --> 00:02:44,499

If you're thinking of going to the C in C yourself,

48
00:02:46,827 --> 00:02:49,022
I shouldn't bother, you'll be wasting your time.

49
00:02:49,107 --> 00:02:51,382
So you're going to do nothing?

-What sort of hold has Vaughn got on you?
-Vaughn? I...

51

action without top-priority permission.

-That is an order.
-I see, sir.

Well, you can override my authority
but not that of UNIT Central Command.

they might be?

Yes.

And look. There's a main flood-relief sewer
running right underneath the warehouse.

69
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:05,546
Yes, but if there's water in the sewers,
wouldn't that affect them?

70
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:09,745
Oh, no, no. Besides, many of these tunnels are dry
and only flood during heavy rainfall.

it's a pretty fantastic story to swallow.

Yes, but so was the attack from the Yeti,
but nevertheless it happened.

With all due respect, sir, she's right.
No one believed in the Yetis until they saw them.
