Packer.

3
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:58,360
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

4
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,330
-Have you discovered where the Professor is?
<i>-Yes, Mr Vaughn.</i>

5
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:02,891
Go and collect him.

6
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:06,721
I want work started on the production
of the machines immediately.

7
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:09,123
Go and recapture Watkins.

8
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:12,290
Don't let anything or anyone stop you.

9
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:20,291
-Oh, thanks!
-Thank goodness you made it.

10
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:22,442
-Any trouble?
-Hundreds of Cybermen about, sir.

11
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:24,807
The sooner we get out of here, the better.
Everybody ready?

12
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:26,769
ALL: Yes!
ISOBEL: Yes, we're ready, we're coming.

13
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:28,046
Listen!

(TYRES SCREECHING)

15
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:38,368
We'd better get out of here,
out of the back way as quickly as possible.

16
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:41,046
-Right!
-Come on, move, everybody. Quickly!

17
00:18:41,132 --> 00:18:42,929
Out of the back door. Hurry it up.

18
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:45,048
Come on, Jamie. Professor, all right? Good.

-TURNER: <i>In bother, sir. We need help.</i>

21
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:57,141
<i>-Can you give us a chopper?</i>
-Yes.

22
00:18:58,232 --> 00:19:01,941
-Can you make sector five?
<i>-We can try, sir.</i>

23
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:04,148
Right, I'll get the chopper there. Out.

24
00:19:06,452 --> 00:19:09,012
How could they escape the Cyber-control?

25
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:11,083
It's that Doctor, something to do with him.

26
00:19:11,172 --> 00:19:12,810
You should've got rid of him
when you had the chance.

27
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:14,484
Shut up, Packer!

28
00:19:17,972 --> 00:19:19,564
I must go on with the invasion.

29
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:22,086
But what about the Professor?

30
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:26,211
Without him, we can't make any more machines.
Without machines, we can't control the Cybermen.

31
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:28,248
Let me worry about that.

32
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:33,688
For the moment,
I have the Cybermen exactly where I want them.

33
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,490
Yeah, but for how long?

34
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:38,689
Now, can you honestly say
that everything's going according to plan?

35
00:19:38,772 --> 00:19:40,842
That nothing's been overlooked? Well, can you?

36
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:42,729
Just obey my orders!

37
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:47,122
Now, get in touch with the compound
and have the radio beam projected.

38
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:49,203
The invasion fleet must be brought in.

39
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:52,007
Now, Doctor, we must deal with
this invasion you say is coming.

40
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:56,768
Yes, at least we know where they'll land.
They'll home in on Vaughn's radio signal.

41
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:59,810
Would we be able to pick them off
with anti-missile missiles?

42
00:19:59,892 --> 00:20:01,723
Yes, that's a good idea. We might have a try.

43
00:20:01,812 --> 00:20:04,531
Right. There's a base near Henlow Downs.
Er, just a minute.

44
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:08,844
-Sergeant Walters?
-Oh, Zoe, sit down, dear. It's a bit bumpy.

45
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:11,605
-Now, how's Jamie's leg?
-Oh, it's just a slight flesh wound.

46
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:13,967
But he's furious, because the Army doctor
won't let him walk on it.

47
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:15,770
Well, he would be, wouldn't he?
How's the Professor?

48
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:17,080
Oh, he'll be all right. Isobel's with him.

(DOCTOR SIGHS)

50
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:20,561
-Anything I can do, Doctor?
-Well, I...

51
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,325
I suggest that you...you go with the Brigadier.

52
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:25,972
As much as I detest computers, I...

53
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:28,612
I think that remarkable brain of yours
will come in very handy.

54
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,410
Right. What are you going to do?

55
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:34,644
I think it's about time I had a serious talk
with our Mr Vaughn.

56
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:37,610
What, go back?
But he'd kill you as soon as look at you.

57
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:41,162
No, we need time
if we're going to stop this attack,

58
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:43,482
and I think I can get us that time.

59
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:46,132
No, this is madness.
I can't afford to let you take that risk.

60
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,282
You can't afford not to, Brigadier.

61
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,522
If you're going to attack
the Cybermen with missiles,

62
00:20:50,612 --> 00:20:52,967
they're going to retaliate,
and we want to know how and with what.

63
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,088
But how can you find that out?

64
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:59,882
I'll leave my radio on and then you'll hear
every word that passes between me and Vaughn.

65
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:03,203
But you'll never get near the place.
The whole area will be crawling with Cybermen.

66
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:05,442
Oh, there's one place
where there'll be no Cybermen.

67
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:07,409
-Where's that?
-In the sewers.

68
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:20,084

I'll give you a call when I get there.

<i>Right. We'll have a chopper in the area</i>
<i>in case you get in trouble.</i>

What? But what, Packer?

81
00:22:08,632 --> 00:22:12,386
Well, we can't make a complete takeover
without a full invasion force.

82
00:22:12,472 --> 00:22:15,589
They'll arrive, Packer, they'll arrive.

83
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:17,824
And when they do,

84
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:23,586
there won't be one city in the entire world
that we don't control.

85

<i>I would rather like a word with you.</i>

92
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,149
Clever of you to avoid our Cyber-control beam.

<i>Oh, it was nothing.</i>

<i>I'll...I'll come up, I know the way.</i>

He must be out of his mind!

96
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,584
Far from it, Packer.

97
00:22:58,072 --> 00:23:02,623
Have the guards search the building,
just in case he's brought any friends with him.

98
00:23:02,952 --> 00:23:04,388
Tell the raiding party to stand by.

-Right. Good luck.
<i>-Thank you.</i>

103

Keep that channel open
and get the whole thing on tape.

-Yes, sir.
-If he yells for help while I'm away,

108
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:37,528
And you trust them?

109
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:42,402
Doctor, I've worked with the Cybermen
for five years, preparing this invasion.

110
00:23:43,092 --> 00:23:47,370
I know them, the way they think,
the single-mindedness of their purpose.

111
00:23:47,452 --> 00:23:51,127
Then you must know what ruthless
and inhuman killers they are.

112
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,565
Of course.

113
00:23:52,652 --> 00:23:55,769
But then, they are my allies, not my enemies.

114
00:23:57,332 --> 00:24:00,369
Do you really think they'll honour
any bargain that you make with them?

115
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:05,924
Oh, I've planned this whole operation
in great detail, allowing for every possible factor.

116
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:08,526
It was I who contacted them in deep space,

117
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:11,251
provided the means by which
they travelled to Earth.

118
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:14,768
And masterminded the whole operation
from A to Z.

(SCOFFS)

120
00:24:17,612 --> 00:24:23,448
They have merely provided their advanced
scientific skills, their might and strength.

121
00:24:23,732 --> 00:24:25,848
And what do they get out of all this?

122
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:31,052
What they want and what they're going to get
are two entirely different things.

123
00:24:31,132 --> 00:24:33,521
Oh, you're a fool, Vaughn.

124
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:36,649
When they get here, they'll take over.

125
00:24:36,732 --> 00:24:40,407
All Cybermen here are conditioned
to obey my orders.

126
00:24:40,492 --> 00:24:42,722
They are directly under my command.

127
00:24:42,812 --> 00:24:46,771
Oh, possibly.
But what about the others, out there in space?

128
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,969
Are they conditioned to obey your commands?

129
00:24:50,052 --> 00:24:52,612
If they're not, I'll destroy them.

130
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,887
-With the Professor's machine?
-Yes.

131
00:24:54,972 --> 00:24:56,928
With one machine?

132
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,448
I'll have more made.

133
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:03,047
But you'll have to have
the Professor's help to do that, won't you?

134
00:25:03,132 --> 00:25:04,850
We've got the Professor.

135
00:25:04,932 --> 00:25:07,287
They'll be under my command,
exactly like the others.

136
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:10,045
But you can't be sure of that, can you?

141
00:25:29,572 --> 00:25:33,531
Major, I think we stand a good chance of getting
at least 90 percent of them.

142
00:25:33,612 --> 00:25:35,921
-How? We haven't got enough missiles.
-Oh, please, Major.

143
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:39,049
Just knocking out half a dozen of them will do
very little good at all.

144
00:25:39,132 --> 00:25:40,360
Let's try for them all.

145
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:43,569
Look, miss, I know my business and
I'm telling you we haven't got enough missiles.

146
00:25:43,652 --> 00:25:45,131
Yes, you have.

147
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:47,680
These things are coming in in a formation pattern.

148
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:52,004
Now if you set your missiles carefully,
you can set up a chain reaction of explosions.

149

No, there isn't time to compute
all the relevant information.

150
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:57,849
-They'd be on top of us by then.
-Give me 30 seconds.

151
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:00,722
Give her what she asks, Major. 30 seconds.

152
00:26:00,812 --> 00:26:04,327
-But, sir, this is ridiculous!
-Just 30 seconds.

153
00:26:05,972 --> 00:26:08,202
-Hold for 30 seconds!
-Sir, that doesn't give us much time.

00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:11,165
You presumably managed to protect them
from the Cyber-control as well?

166
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:12,844
What are they planning?

167
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:15,162
I don't know what you're talking about.

168
00:27:17,732 --> 00:27:18,960
Packer?

169
00:27:19,132 --> 00:27:20,247
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

170
00:27:20,332 --> 00:27:23,642
-Is the radio beam in the compound aligned yet?
<i>-Yes, sir, it's all ready.</i>

171
00:27:23,732 --> 00:27:26,929
Good. Then link the beam to the invasion fleet.

172
00:27:27,372 --> 00:27:28,964
<i>Right, Mr Vaughn.</i>

173
00:27:30,892 --> 00:27:34,521
Now whatever it is
your UNIT friends are trying to do...

174
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,091
it's too late.

175
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:56,406
COMMUNICATOR: <i>The first transporter fleet</i>
<i>is being attacked and destroyed.</i>

176
00:27:56,492 --> 00:27:59,689
<i>-You have betrayed us.</i>
-No!

177
00:27:59,772 --> 00:28:04,084
<i>The failure of this mission is due to you.</i>

178
00:28:04,172 --> 00:28:07,642
<i>We will now take over the invasion.</i>

179
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:10,121
No! Wait! Give me time!

180
00:28:10,212 --> 00:28:12,043
I can stop this opposition!

181
00:28:12,132 --> 00:28:14,600
<i>There is no more time.</i>

182
00:28:14,772 --> 00:28:16,967
<i>We no longer need you.</i>

183
00:28:17,252 --> 00:28:21,131
<i>The Cyber-Megatron bomb will be delivered.</i>

184
00:28:21,212 --> 00:28:25,444
<i>We must destroy life on Earth completely.</i>

185
00:28:25,652 --> 00:28:28,007
<i>Every living being.</i>
