00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:31,606
Oh, yes, it could be 20th century.

2
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:36,963
What's the matter with the Tardis, Doctor?
It keeps going wrong all the time.

3
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:40,267
It merely needs an overhaul, Jamie,
just like any piece of machinery.

4
00:02:40,347 --> 00:02:44,818
We might try and look up our old
friend Professor Travers in London.

5
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:47,375
-He might be able to help us, hmm?
-Yeah. Aye.

6
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:52,143
Always supposing he's not a baby or a schoolboy!
Now come along!

7
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:55,216
Let's just collect this circuit

8
0:02:055,412 --> 0:02:056,513
There.

9
00:02:58,287 --> 00:03:02,485
Yes. It's all right.
It's just a fault in the visual stabiliser circuit.

10
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:05,035
It's, uh... We'd better take that, too.

11
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:20,616
-Er... Can you give us a lift to London?
-Yes, I suppose so.

12
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:22,026
DOCTOR: In you get.

13
00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:25,662
Thank you. Thank you very much.

14
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,339
DOCTOR: Here we are.

15
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,576
Right.

16
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:45,822
-Well, that's odd! It says ''Watkins''.
-JAMIE: Must have the wrong house.

17
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:49,377
Well, the telephone directory definitely said
number 1 8.

18
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:50,786
We'll ask.

00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:12,745
(DOORBELL RINGING INCESSANTLY)

20
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,900
If you don't mind, I'm trying to work!

21
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:28,263
Oh. I'm sorry, miss, but we wondered
whether you could help us.

22
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:29,736
We wondered if...

23
00:04:29,827 --> 00:04:32,546
Oh, look, now the stupid thing's
gone and jammed!

24
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:34,697
Oh, dear, perhaps I could help you.

25
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:36,220
Well, do you know anything about cameras?

26
00:04:36,307 --> 00:04:38,343
Yes, a little. I see...

27
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:39,985
Now I had it on automatic shutter.

28
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:41,625
Taking photos of yourself?

29
00:04:41,707 --> 00:04:44,460
Yes, then you interrupted me
and the stupid thing jammed!

30
00:04:44,547 --> 00:04:47,857
Have you come to see my uncle? He's not here.
But who are you?

31
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:49,505
Friends of his? Fellow nuts?

32
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:51,737
Please let me answer one question at a time.

33
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:53,738
Hey, you be careful with that thing.
It cost me a fortune.

34
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,387
It's all right. It's a very simple mechanism.

35
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:58,776
-Who is your uncle?
-Professor Watkins.

36
00:04:58,867 --> 00:04:59,902
Oh.

37
00:04:59,987 --> 00:05:02,023
Then Professor Travers doesn't live here?

38
00:05:02,107 --> 00:05:04,223
Well, he did. He left about a month ago.

39
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:05,581
Gone to America for a year with his daughter.

40
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,066
Oh, that's just great!

41
00:05:07,147 --> 00:05:08,819
My uncle worked at the Cavendish lab.

42
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:10,545
He wanted to do some work so Professor Travers

43
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:12,538
said he could use his daughter's lab here.

44
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:15,061
And I moved in because I got kicked
out of my studio last week.

45
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:17,422
What field of science is your uncle in?

46
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:20,863
Oh, I don't know,
he's in applied physics or something.

47
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:23,222
Always messing around with computers
and things. Complete nut.

48
00:05:23,307 --> 00:05:25,741
Well, that is fortunate.
Perhaps he might be able to help us.

49
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:27,226
-Is he at home?
-No.

50
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:30,140
-Well, where is he?
-Well, how do I know? I'm not his keeper.

51
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:33,219
-Hey, have you fixed it?
-Oh, yes, that's all right.

52
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:35,616
-That's really great, thanks!
-Miss...

53
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:36,776
Hey!

54
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:40,901
That's a jolly outfit.
Would you mind posing for me?

55
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:42,136
-What?
-Look. Just stand there.

-Miss!
-Isobel.

57
00:05:43,987 --> 00:05:47,138
Yeah, okay. Now just stand here.
Now get... Head over the shoulder.

58

Have you any idea when your uncle
is going to be back?

59
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:52,496
No, he left about a week ago.
I haven't seen him since.

60
00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:53,622
A week?

61
00:05:53,707 --> 00:05:56,380
Yeah, he was prattling on about some
new invention, or something or other,

62
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:59,027
and having the chance to develop it.
Now... Not you.

63
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:00,699
-Oh.
-ISOBEL: Okay. Now.

64
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:03,096
Can't you get in touch with him?

65
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:04,546
No, I tried.

66
00:06:04,627 --> 00:06:06,697
I wanted to borrow a couple of quid off
him in a hurry,

67
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:08,743
but, well, they said
he wasn't available for phone calls.

68
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,579
They! Now... Now who is ''they''?

69
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,305
Just get that, will you? I don't know.

70
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:15,060

71
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:16,865

72
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:18,460
Yes, probably.

73
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:22,106
You mean your uncle has gone to
work for these people?

74
00:06:22,187 --> 00:06:24,417
-Mmm-hmm.
-Well, surely we can get in touch with him.

75
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:27,260
Well, you can try telephoning,
but I doubt if you'll get any joy.

76
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:29,622
Oh, phone's in the hall and
the number's scribbled on the wall.

77
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:31,026
Thank you.

78
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:32,706
Hey. Don't go.

79

photographing a real model.

-Yes, but I must speak with him.

-So, now what?
-There's only one thing for it!

91
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:06,496
We'll have to go there ourselves.

92

Okay, that's fabulous, just keep it like that.

93
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,178
Great. Any luck?

94
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,464
No, it was a stupid simple-minded

95
00:07:16,547 --> 00:07:17,662
Well, what do we do now?

96
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:19,419
Well, Jamie and I are going to this place.
Come on, Zoe.

97
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:21,782
Oh, no, thanks. I think I'll stay here.
It's great fun.

Well, come on, Jamie. Oh, the address?

100
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:27,983
-Oh, that's scribbled on the wall, too.
-DOCTOR: Oh, thank you.

101
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:30,137
Do you not write anything down on paper at all?

102
00:07:30,227 --> 00:07:31,819
Well, I'd only lose it if I did.

103
00:07:31,907 --> 00:07:35,024
Writing on a wall is much safer.
You can't lose a wall, can you?

No.

-Yes, sir.

devotion to duty.

-How did you know?

00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:50,281

-No, what is it?
