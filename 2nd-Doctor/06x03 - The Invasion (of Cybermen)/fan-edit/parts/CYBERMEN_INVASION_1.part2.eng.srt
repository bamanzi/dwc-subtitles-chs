1
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:03,041
You're still worried about your two friends,
aren't you?

2
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:22,741
Packer.

3
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:24,861
<i>Yes, Mr Vaughn?</i>

4
00:13:24,947 --> 00:13:27,905
Packer, those two uninvited guests
we had this morning,

5
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:29,920
- I assume they were photographed?
- Yes, sir.

6
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:32,636
Have some prints taken and sent up to me.

7
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:52,045
-Well, what do we do now, Doctor?
-Accept the situation, Jamie.

8
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:54,402
Nothing else we can do.

9
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,717
You're still worried about
your two friends, aren't you? Why?

10
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:06,865
Oh, I don't know.

11
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,097
I've just got this feeling
that something's happened to them.

12
00:14:09,187 --> 00:14:10,984
Why on earth should it have?

13
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:15,857
No reason at all, really.
It's not a logical conclusion, just intuition.

14
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:19,936
Well, I'll tell you what we'll do, then.
We'll go right out after them, okay?

15
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,016
Oh, yes, please.

16
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:24,463
But we'd better leave a note for them,
just in case they come back when we're not here.

17
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:15,564
Would you mind telling us what all this is about?

18
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:16,796
You'll find out, sir.

19
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:17,956
Sir?

20
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:24,800
-All right, Benton, thank you.
-Sir.

21
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:27,082
-NAAFI break, sir?
-Very well.

22
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:30,284
How nice to see you again, Doctor.

23
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:32,961
It's Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart!

24
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:35,720
Ah, Brigadier now. I've gone up in the world.

25
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:37,957
Of course, the Yetis. We met you in the...

26
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:39,366
That's right, McCrimmon, in the Underground.

27
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:40,880
Must be four years ago now.

28
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:43,276
That long. It only seems like
a couple of weeks ago, doesn't it?

29
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:47,042
I've told you over and over again, Jamie.
Time is relative.

30
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:50,757
Are you still making a nonsense of it, Doctor,
in your... What was it called?

31
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:52,758
-Tardis?
-Yes, we're still travelling. Yes.

32
00:15:52,847 --> 00:15:54,838
Yes, Mr Travers told me all about it.

33
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:56,918
It's, um... Well, it's...

34
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:58,963
To say the least, an unbelievable machine.

35
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:02,039
DOCTOR: Any more unbelievable
than the Yetis, hmm?

36
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,961
No, true. I'm not quite so much of a sceptic
as I was since that little escapade.

37
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:09,642
But what's all this, and why all the
cloak and dagger stuff to bring us here?

38
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,242
Yes, I'm sorry about that, but my chaps have to be
a bit melodramatic in their methods.

39
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:14,726
But I'll explain. Oh, do sit down.

40
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,604
-Thank you.
-How nice.

41
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:31,582
(WHIRRING)

42
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:43,736
Has the information been considered?

43
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:46,466
COMMUNICATOR: <i>The images of the two humans</i>

44
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,017
<i>have been analysed and registered.</i>

45
00:16:50,747 --> 00:16:54,342
<i>They are known and are hostile.</i>

46
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:56,941
Hostile? How can that be?

47
00:16:57,027 --> 00:16:58,824
Have you been on Earth before?

48
00:16:58,907 --> 00:17:02,536
<i>No, they have been recognised</i>

49
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:06,919
<i>They are dangerous and must be destroyed.</i>

50
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,756
Yes, well, since the Yeti do, I've been in charge
of an independent intelligence group

51
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:15,283
that we call UNIT,
that's United Nations Intelligence Taskforce.

52
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,086
You mean you're like a... A world secret police?

53
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:21,125
Not quite. We don't actually arrest people,
we just investigate them.

54
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,879
What about us? I mean, you arrested us.

55
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:24,002
Not really.

56
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:27,284
You see, my men were keeping a watch on
the International Electromatic Headquarters

57
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:28,516
when you two showed up.

58
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:31,075
I've been keeping a check
on everyone going in that building.

59
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:34,000
Your photographs were transmitted to
this Headquarters and I recognised you.

60
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,885
Well, what's so odd about
people going into the building?

61
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,958
Oh, nothing odd about them going in.

62
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:40,924
The problem is some of them haven't come out.

63
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,638
BRIGADIER: This is Gordon Jones,
lecturer in physics, Churchill College, Cambridge.

64
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:05,522
Next one's a chap I knew at Sandhurst,
old Billy Rutlidge.

65
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:08,565
He's got himself a very cushy number
at the Ministry of Defence.

66
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:12,560
And all these people went into the building,
the IE building, and didn't come out.

67
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:14,478
No, no, most of them came out again,

68
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:17,798
but there was something
definitely odd about them when they did.

69
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:19,002
Odd?

70
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:20,944
Ah, yes, Miss Watkins.

71
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,103
You're concerned about your uncle, aren't you?

72
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:24,700
I'd like to know where he is, yes.

73
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:28,496
He's perfectly well, I assure you,
although a little, uh...

74
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:31,777
uncooperative at the moment.

75
00:18:32,827 --> 00:18:35,261
Your visit here is most opportune.

76
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:38,461
I think that you can be very useful to me.

77
00:18:38,547 --> 00:18:40,299
Me? But... But how?

78
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:45,257
Your uncle needs to be ''persuaded''
to continue his work for me.

79
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:48,095
But I can't do anything about that.

80
00:18:48,187 --> 00:18:49,222
No.

81
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:51,745
But I can. Now...

82
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:56,859
Packer, I'd like you to take care
of these two young ladies, please.

83
00:18:58,227 --> 00:18:59,546
Take them!

84
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:01,380
(GIRLS PROTESTING)

85
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:07,161
Um, Brigadier, tell me more about this

86
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,841
International Electromatics setup.

87
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,685
Well, there isn't much to tell.

88
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:14,406
The head of the group
is a man named Tobias Vaughn.

89
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,955
Oh, yes, we've met him. A nice man.
He gave me this.

90
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:18,196
Jamie.

91
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,602
-Oh, yes, that's just the small stuff.
-Put it away.

92
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:23,565
They control practically
all of the major computer lines.

93
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:27,037
They made their real breakthrough in
micromonolithic circuit designing.

94
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:28,924
Undercutting practically everyone else
on the market.

95
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:30,520
But what's your interest in this?

96
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:33,724
Well, I knew a little about Vaughn
before his sudden success.

97
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:37,880
I put out a routine check on him and
we came up with one or two things of interest.

98
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,606
Like the disappearance of Professor Watkins.

99
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:42,518
-Yes.
-Ah, see.

100
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:48,759
I... I don't suppose you have any authority

101
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:50,519
to search the building, have you?

102
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:54,600
No, Vaughn's too powerful,
he's got too many top people on his side.

103
00:19:54,687 --> 00:19:58,805
You see, Doctor, I daren't make a move
against him unless I have good reason to do so.

104
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:02,197
Well, it looks to me,
if Jamie and I want to find the Professor,

105
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:04,084
we'll have to do it in our own way.

106
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:05,998
That's about the sum of it.

107
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:09,045
However, should you find yourself
in any difficulty...

108
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:10,765
Sergeant Walters!

109
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,562
-Yes, sir?
-Got a TM-45 handy?

110
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,075
Yes, sir. Right here.

111
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:17,361
-Is that a tank?
-Oh, no, no.

112
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:18,641
My units are on constant alert,

113
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:21,366
so should you find yourselves in any trouble,
you can just give us a call.

114
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:23,005
-Jolly good!
-Here you are, sir.

115
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:24,805
Thank you, Sergeant.

116
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:26,764
Now, this is a small transceiver,

117
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:29,156
range of about fifty miles on a set frequency.

118
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:31,920
-Just press this button and ask for me.
-Oh, yes, that's splendid! Yes.

119
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:33,804
This should come in very handy.

120
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:36,355
Call me anytime. I'm usually available.

121
00:20:40,387 --> 00:20:42,537
No. They must have gone out.

122
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:45,296
Zoe?

123
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:48,055
Isobel?

124
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,903
Probably gone for a walk.

125
00:20:50,987 --> 00:20:53,501
Look, Jamie, sandwiches. I'm hungry.

126
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:55,898
-Want one?
-Thank you.

127
00:20:57,987 --> 00:21:02,060
You know, Doctor, that chap Mr Vaughn
doesn't seem such a bad man.

128
00:21:02,147 --> 00:21:03,216
(TURNS RADIO ON)

129
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:04,706
Oh, Jamie!

130
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:06,698
How can I think when you've got that thing on?

131
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:07,856
Hey!

132
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:10,858
All right, all right.

133
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:13,937
-Don't break it.
-All right!

134
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,065
I just want to have a look at it, that's all.

135
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:18,815
Oh, yes.

136
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:23,305
-It's an interesting little piece...
-What?

137
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,059
Well, well, well.

138
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,540
What have we here?

139
00:21:30,627 --> 00:21:32,697
What do you mean, ''What have we here?''

140
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:37,345
There's a micromonolithic circuit
in the back plate of this radio.

141
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:38,781
Well, what's that?

142
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:40,937
It's a very complex circuit in miniature.

143
00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:42,938
What's so odd about that, then?

144
00:21:43,027 --> 00:21:45,222
It has nothing to do with the radio,
as far as I can see.

145
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:48,777
-Oh, Doctor, just put it back together again!
-All right.

146
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:52,143
I don't suppose Zoe would have left a note,
do you?

147
00:21:56,387 --> 00:21:59,982
No, I can't see anything.
Well, you might at least help me look for it.

148
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:02,103
I suggest we try the wall.

149
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,222
Eh?

150
00:22:03,307 --> 00:22:05,946
Isobel never writes anything on paper.

151
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:08,941
-You can't lose a wall, remember?
-Oh.

152
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:12,346
Ah! ''Tired of waiting.

153
00:22:12,427 --> 00:22:16,181
''Gone to IE offices to look for you.
Zoe and Isobel.''

154
00:22:16,387 --> 00:22:18,696
Jamie! We better go after them.
