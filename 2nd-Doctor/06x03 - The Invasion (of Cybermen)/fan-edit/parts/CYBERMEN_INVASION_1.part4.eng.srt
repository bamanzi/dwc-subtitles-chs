1
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:22,217
-GUARD: You two! Over here!

2
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:25,424
Get those two girls
over to the main administration building! Move!

3
00:36:25,507 --> 00:36:28,624
-Zoe and Isobel.
-Wait. We'll follow in a few moments.

4
00:36:46,407 --> 00:36:49,524
Take them inside. Central block, tenth floor.

5
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:05,558
(ROTORS WHIRRING)

6
00:37:13,287 --> 00:37:15,517
Could be the Brigadier's lot. Call them up for help.

7
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:18,440
No, no, not yet. We've got to rescue the girls first.

8
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,041
Tenth floor, central block. Come on.

9
00:37:25,647 --> 00:37:28,605
There's a lot of unusual activity, sir.
Guards everywhere.

10
00:37:28,687 --> 00:37:31,247
It looks like some sort of emergency.

11
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:33,397
BRIGADIER: <i>Any sign of the Doctor and the boy?</i>

12
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:35,239
No, sir. None at all.

13
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,845
<i>Right,Jimmy. Get out of the area and stand by.</i>

14
00:37:38,927 --> 00:37:40,679
Right, sir. Will do.

15
00:37:47,707 --> 00:37:50,346
-All units, please, Sergeant.
-Yes, sir.

16
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:52,626
Go ahead, sir.

17
00:37:54,907 --> 00:37:57,740
This is the Brigadier. All units, stand by.

18
00:37:58,427 --> 00:38:00,816
Full penetration of red sector imminent.

19
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:02,515
Hey, Zoe.

20
00:38:03,287 --> 00:38:04,606
Zoe, look!

21
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:07,598
-Doctor!
-Jamie!

22
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:09,602
Yes, Doctor, come in.

23
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:13,965
<i>Brigadier, I think we shall require</i>
<i>a little assistance in a few moments.</i>

24
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:15,196
Are you in trouble?

25
00:38:15,287 --> 00:38:19,565
<i>No, but we shall need help.</i>
<i>You have a helicopter in the area?</i>

26
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:20,762
Yes.

27
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:24,198
<i>I wonder, have they a rope ladder on board?</i>

28
00:38:24,287 --> 00:38:26,676
Yes, I'm pretty sure they have. Where are you?

29
00:38:26,767 --> 00:38:29,600
<i>We're just going up to the roof</i>
<i>of the main building.</i>

30
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:33,919
<i>That is the central block on the north side.</i>

31
00:38:34,447 --> 00:38:38,725
<i>That should give your helicopter cover</i>
<i>should there be any ground fire.</i>

32
00:38:38,887 --> 00:38:40,923
<i>-Have you got that?</i>
-Yes, I've got that.

33
00:38:41,007 --> 00:38:42,201
Over and out.

34
00:40:06,327 --> 00:40:08,397
You were lucky, dead lucky.

35
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:11,957
He said it would be
a simple rescue operation. Simple.

36
00:40:12,047 --> 00:40:13,162
But what about my uncle?

37
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,602
-They've still got him prisoner.
-Don't worry, Miss Watkins.

38
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:18,724
As soon as we return to base,
I'm going to raise hell and get some action.

39
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:20,126
You think they'll listen to you now?

40
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:24,644
No one, not even Tobias Vaughn, can go as far
as trying to shoot down one of my helicopters.

41
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:28,197
Oh, I wish I'd had my camera.
I could have got a fortune for those pictures.

42
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:29,515
Yes, it was a pity.

43
00:40:29,607 --> 00:40:32,075
That would have clinched it
as far as the Ministry are concerned, sir.

44
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:35,364
Don't worry, Jimmy.
Billy Rutlidge will have to take some action now.

45
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:37,177
Why am I being taken back to London?

46
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:39,940
What about my niece? What's happened to Isobel?

47
00:40:40,027 --> 00:40:41,699
I tell you, she's perfectly safe.

48
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:43,778
Well, I want to see her!

49
00:40:43,867 --> 00:40:45,300
So you shall.

50
00:40:45,587 --> 00:40:48,021
When you've finished working on your machine.

51
00:40:48,627 --> 00:40:51,619
Do as I ask and you shall both go free.

52
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:56,304
You don't even expect me to believe you, do you?

53
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,696
Well, you've very little choice.

54
00:41:01,147 --> 00:41:02,899
Now, we're going back to London.

55
00:41:02,987 --> 00:41:06,582
There you will work on your machine
to my specifications.

56
00:41:07,787 --> 00:41:10,426
You will have 24 hours to complete it.

57
00:41:10,907 --> 00:41:14,183
Only if you haven't finished your work by that time

58
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:17,464
would you have cause to worry about your niece.

59
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:21,820
-BRIGADIER: Mean anything to you, Doctor?
-Possibly.

60
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:25,180
How long ago were these objects first sighted?

61
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:28,100
Reports have been drifting in
for well over a year now.

62
00:41:28,187 --> 00:41:31,304
We sent up fighter planes to investigate,
but nothing ever came of it.

63
00:41:31,387 --> 00:41:34,743
The odd thing about these sightings
is that they usually seem to disappear

64
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:36,818
somewhere over southeast England.

65
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:40,183
But isn't that where all those factories
and laboratories of Vaughn's are?

66
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:41,197
Exactly. 

67
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,464
Well, obviously they bring these things,

68
00:41:43,547 --> 00:41:46,983
whatever they are, up from the factory
in the country to the London premises.

69
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:48,500
That's where we're going to find the answer.

70
00:41:48,587 --> 00:41:50,464
You mean go back to Vaughn's place?

71
00:41:50,547 --> 00:41:53,459
I don't think that's wise, Doctor.
You've been lucky so far.

72
00:41:53,547 --> 00:41:55,185
Aye, if you think I'm going back inside there...

73
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:56,985
Jamie, we have to find what is inside these crates.

74
00:41:57,067 --> 00:42:01,538
Brigadier, have you got a map,
including the London premises?

75
00:42:01,627 --> 00:42:04,699
-Yes, yes, I think so. Sergeant Walters!
-Sir?

76
00:43:01,507 --> 00:43:04,419
-Jamie, I'm afraid I was right!
-Eh?
