You can't do this! I won't let you!

00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:37,841
Now you're beginning to understand
the Cybermen, Vaughn.

5
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:39,485
You can't make bargains with them!

6
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:42,081
I won't let them take over, I won't!

7
00:28:44,847 --> 00:28:48,806
You think you're indestructible?
Well, I can destroy all of you!

Where is the transmitter for the radio beam?

16
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:35,642
We can't fight them.
They're too powerful, too many of them.

17
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:38,082
Oh, don't be a fool, man. Where do we turn it off?

18
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:42,126
-At the compound, but they'll be there.
-Right. We must stop them.

19
00:29:42,607 --> 00:29:45,963
Brigadier, Brigadier, this is the Doctor.

20
00:29:46,047 --> 00:29:47,366
Can you still hear me?

21
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:50,156
Yes, Doctor, we heard everything. What do we do?

22
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,760
<i>There are only two possibilities.</i>

23
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:55,886
<i>We must either cut off the transmitter</i>
<i>of the radio beam at the compound</i>

24
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:58,356
<i>or destroy the Cyberman spaceship.</i>

25
00:29:58,447 --> 00:29:59,800
How much time do we have?

26
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:02,526
<i>Oh, I've no idea. It could be minutes or hours.</i>

27
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:05,440
<i>Depends how long it takes them</i>
<i>to prepare this bomb of theirs.</i>

28
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:08,246
Well, destroying the spaceship
is going to take time.

29
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:10,603
<i>Then there's only one chance. The radio beam.</i>

30
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:12,598
<i>Er, wait. Vaughn.</i>

31
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:15,323
<i>Now, Vaughn, will you help us?</i>

32
00:30:15,407 --> 00:30:18,444
<i>We must try to get to the controls</i>
<i>of the radio beam.</i>

33
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,677
<i>We'll never do it in time unless you help us!</i>

34
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:22,086
You still think you have a chance?

35
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:26,046
-Yes, if you'll help us!
-Help you? Why should I?

36
00:30:26,127 --> 00:30:28,595
Well, to save us! To save yourself!

37
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:32,841
And if I survive, what future have I got?
What will the world do with me?

38
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:34,997
Oh, for heaven's sake,
stop thinking about yourself!

39
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:38,284
Think of the millions of people on Earth
who are about to die!

40
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:41,397
Appealing to my better nature.

41

No.

42

If I help you, it'll be because I hate them.

43

The Cybermen, my ''allies''.

44
00:30:51,127 --> 00:30:54,517
You think I'm mad,
that all I want is power for its own sake.

45
00:30:54,607 --> 00:30:56,563
No, I have to have power.

46
00:30:56,647 --> 00:31:01,562
The world is weak, vulnerable,
a mess of uncoordinated and impossible ideals.

47
00:31:01,647 --> 00:31:05,083
It needs a strong man, a single mind.

48
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:07,635
-A leader.
-Vaughn, will you listen?

49
00:31:09,807 --> 00:31:11,081
Right.

50
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:14,055
I'll help you to destroy them because I hate them.

51
00:31:14,347 --> 00:31:19,442
They... destroyed my dream.

Cybermen! Take cover!

70
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:17,804
They've got a main control switch
for the radio beam.
