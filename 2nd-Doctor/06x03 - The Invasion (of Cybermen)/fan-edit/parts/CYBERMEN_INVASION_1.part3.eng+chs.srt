BENTON: <i>Some time ago, sir.</i>

- 你都听到了吗, Jimmy?  - 听到了, 长官

20
00:23:32,347 --> 00:23:34,258
(ROTORS WHIRRING)

00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:39,687
Yes, they've just gone into the IE area, sir.

- 待命中，长官  - 还有，Jimmy，保持在他们视线之外

If Vaughn's private army see you,
they might well get the wind up,
如果 Vaughn 的私人武装看到你们，他们可能会搞事

26
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:54,278

for the Doctor and the boy.
这可能会让局面对博士和那个小伙子不利

27
00:23:57,747 --> 00:23:58,816
Hey!
嘿

28
00:24:03,147 --> 00:24:05,786
- Doctor, it's...  - Confusing, isn't it?
- 博士，这...  - 分不清了，是吧？

29
00:24:06,107 --> 00:24:08,063
It's exactly the same as your office in London.

30

In all basic essentials, yes, it is.

That's the secret of my success, you see.

Uniformity. Duplication.
匀称，一致

33
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:16,584
My whole empire is based on that principle.

00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,419
The very essence of business efficiency.

- Do sit down.  - DOCTOR: Oh, how kind.
- 请坐下  - 哦，有心了

36
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:29,176
I must say I'm rather glad
we have this opportunity to talk.

37
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,461
Really?
真的？

38
00:24:31,507 --> 00:24:34,305
I should, of course, be angry with you.
当然，其实我应该生你们的气

39
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:38,422
You've thwarted my elaborate
security precautions twice.
你们挫败了我精心制定的安全预防措施，两次

40
00:24:38,747 --> 00:24:40,977
- I'd like to know why.
- Oh, that's quite simple.
- 我想知道为什么  - 哦，那很简单

41
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:44,298
I hate computers
and refuse to be bullied by them.
我讨厌电脑，拒绝被他们欺负

42
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:46,096
Your young friend Zoe.
你们的年轻朋友 Zoe

43
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:49,020
- Well, what about her?
- Well, she appears to have the same instincts.
- 哦，她怎么了  - 她似乎也有同样的直觉

44
00:24:49,107 --> 00:24:52,019
She so confused one of my computers
she ruined its memory store.
所以她搞烂了我们的一台电脑, 毁坏了它的内存记忆

45
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:55,417
So that's why your thugs
dragged her and Isobel away.
所以这就是为什么你那些暴徒会把她和 Isobel 拖走

46
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:58,021
My dear young man, I wasn't angry with her.
我亲爱的年轻人，我没生她的气

47
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:00,703
On the contrary, I found the incident quite amusing.
恰恰相反，我发现这个事情很有意思

48
00:25:00,807 --> 00:25:02,703
She's a remarkable girl.
她是个不寻常的女孩儿

49
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:07,579
And you, Doctor, are obviously a man
of no mean scientific ability.
而你，博士，显然是个科学能力不一般的人

50
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:09,016
Why do you say that?
你为什么这么说？

51
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:12,577
Well, my research department
found these quite fascinating.
哦，我的研究部发现这些东西很吸引人

52
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:16,023
There's a totally illogical factor
in their construction.
在它们的结构里面有一个完全不符合逻辑的部分

53
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:18,663
Are they of your own invention?
这是你自己发明的吗？

54
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:23,743
Ah, you're determined to guard your secret, I see.
啊，你下定了决心要保守你的秘密，我明白了

55
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:28,502
I don't blame you,
and I promise not to pry any more.
我不怪你，而且我保证不再打听了

56
00:25:29,507 --> 00:25:33,056
- In fact, I'll do all I can to help you.
- Oh, how kind.
- 事实上，我会竭尽所能帮助你  - 噢，你真好

57
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,017
Now, you say you came here
looking for Professor Watkins
现在，你们说来这里是找 Watkins 教授

58
00:25:36,107 --> 00:25:37,665
because you thought he might be able to help you.
说是因为你们觉得他也许可以帮助你们

59
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:38,782
Yes.
是的

60
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:42,337
Well, then I'll try to persuade him
to put aside his work and, um,
好，那我会试试, 看能否说服他把工作放一放

61
00:25:42,427 --> 00:25:44,782
concentrate his efforts on your behalf.
聚焦到你的事情上

62
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,698
Make yourself at home.
请随意

63
00:25:51,907 --> 00:25:53,183
Hey, look, you're not going to trust him, are you?
嘿，听着, 你没打算相信他吧，是吗？

64
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:56,905
- I mean, what about Zoe and Isobel?
- I haven't forgotten them, Jamie.
- 我是说，Zoe 和 Isobel 怎么办？  - 我没忘记她们, Jamie

65
00:25:56,987 --> 00:25:58,864
They're in that box. I'm sure of it.
她们就在那里面，我敢肯定

66
00:25:58,947 --> 00:26:02,064
Jamie, we're not going to help Zoe
by annoying Mr Vaughn, are we?
Jamie，我们惹恼 Vaughn 先生并不能帮上 Zoe，对吗？

67
00:26:02,147 --> 00:26:04,217
I don't think you can annoy that man
even if you wanted to.
我觉得就是你想，你也没法惹恼那个家伙

68
00:26:04,307 --> 00:26:05,786
He's being as nice as pie.
他的脾气很好

69
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:06,902
He's too nice.
他有点太好了

70
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:08,864
- Yeah, but why should he be?
- I don't know.
- 是，但为什么他会这样？  - 我不知道

71
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:11,984
He's a little bit too interested
in these circuits for my liking.
他对这些电路有点太感兴趣了, 我不喜欢

72
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:14,501
Hey, do you think he knows
about the Tardis, then?
嘿，那，你觉得他知道 TARDIS 的事吗？

73
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:17,740
Well, I don't see how he could do.
我看不出他怎么能知道

74
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:22,457
No, well, perhaps this Professor Watkins
will be able to tell us what's going on around here.
不能。也许这位 Watkins 教授能告诉我们这里在搞什么

75
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:25,460
- Yes, but that's what's worrying me.
- What?
- 是，但让我困扰的也是这个  - 什么？

76
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:27,666
Well, if Vaughn has anything to hide...
是这样，如果 Vaughn 有事情瞒着我们...

77
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,766
why is he letting us talk to Watkins?
他为什么会让我们跟 Watkins 谈话？

78
00:26:30,227 --> 00:26:31,983
I'd think about it if I were you, Professor.
如果我是你，我就会考虑的，教授

79
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:35,539
After all, she is a pretty girl.
It'd be a shame to spoil all that.
毕竟，她是个漂亮的女孩儿，破坏这一点的话就就太惭愧了

80
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,460
What a vicious sadist you are, Packer.
你是个多么恶毒的虐待狂啊，Packer

81
00:26:40,027 --> 00:26:42,143
I don't believe you, anyway.
我不相信你，不管怎样

82
00:26:42,987 --> 00:26:45,296
I don't make idle threats, Professor,
as you well know.
我不会做无谓的威胁，教授，你是知道的

83
00:26:45,387 --> 00:26:47,038
If you want to see that girl again in one piece,
如果你还想见到那个女孩儿完好无损话，

84
00:26:47,187 --> 00:26:48,538
I suggest you do as Mr Vaughn asks.
我建议你按 Vaughn 先生要求的做

85
00:26:48,627 --> 00:26:52,097
How do I know that you already
haven't harmed her, if you had got her.
我怎么知道你们还没有伤害她, 既然你们都抓住她了？

86
00:26:52,187 --> 00:26:54,701
You can take my word for that, Professor.
你可以得到我对此的承诺，教授

87
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,140
(LAUGHING) Your word.
你的承诺

88
00:26:56,227 --> 00:26:58,695
I know just how much value I can place on that.
我可知道它值多少钱

89
00:26:58,787 --> 00:27:01,347
Harsh words, Professor, harsh words.
话说过份了啊，教授，过份了

90
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:05,586
Any progress?
有什么进展？

91
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:11,540
- So you haven't yet completed the machine?
- No, and I don't intend to.
- 看来你还没有完成这个机器  - 没，而且我也没打算完成

92
00:27:11,627 --> 00:27:13,936
Oh, I think you will, Professor.
噢，我想你会的，教授

93
00:27:14,027 --> 00:27:15,983
Much as I detest violence,
虽然我很讨厌暴力

94
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:21,777
I find it difficult to restrain Packer's
indisputable talent for persuasion.
我发现很难压制 Packer 那无可争辩的说服能力

95
00:27:22,427 --> 00:27:24,338
Your niece is in our custody,
你侄女在我们的监管之下

96
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:28,181
and unless you do as I ask,
I shall hand her over to Packer.
除非你按我的要求去做, 否则我就把她交给 Packer

97
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:30,579
The choice is yours.
选择权在你

98
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:37,181
If I do cooperate, will you let her go?
如果我合作，你们会放她走吗？

99
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:42,539
Oh, no, she's our guarantee,
but she'll come to no harm.
哦，不会，她是我们的保证人，不过她不会受到伤害

100
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:44,986
All right.
好吧

101
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:48,021
- But I must see Isobel first.
- Of course.
但我必须先见到 Isobel  - 当然

102
00:27:48,107 --> 00:27:50,541
Oh, there is just one other thing.
哦，另外只有一件事了

103
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,425
Don't look at me so suspiciously,
my dear Professor.
别用这种怀疑的眼神看我，亲爱的教授

104
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:56,067
It's merely that there are some friends 
of yours here who wish to see you.
只不过这里有几位你的朋友想要见你

105
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:59,503
- Friends?
- Yes, they've gone to great pains to seek you out.
- 朋友？  - 是的，他们费尽周折要把你找出来

106
00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:02,340
But I haven't been allowed visitors
since I came here.
但自从我到这里来，就不被允许会客

107
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:04,782
Why are you suddenly considerate?
你怎么突然这么贴心了？

108
00:28:04,867 --> 00:28:06,823
I might tell them everything.
我可能把一切都告诉他们

109
00:28:06,907 --> 00:28:08,499
Everything?
一切？

110
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:11,260
My dear Professor, you know nothing that can harm me.
亲爱的教授，你不知道任何对我不利的信息

111
00:28:11,347 --> 00:28:13,861
Besides, there's always Isobel
to consider, isn't there?
再说了，总还得考虑 Isobel 吧，是不？

112
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:17,417
- Or would you rather leave her to me?
- No, no, Packer.
- 或许你更愿意把她留给我？  - 不，不，Packer

113
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:20,544
The Professor's going to do exactly as we ask.
教授会严格按我们要求的做

114
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,466
Aren't you?
对吧？

115
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:25,485
Yes, of course, I remember
Anne Travers telling me about you.
是的，当然了，我记得 Anne Travers 跟我说起过你

116
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,630
<i>(Anne Travers 是老 Travers 教授的女儿，
在 05x05 The Web of Fear 一集中他们父女俩
与博士、UNIT一起对抗雪怪)</i>

117
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:27,683
She was a student of mine, 
you know, some years ago.
她是我的学生，你知道，多年以前

118
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:29,325
- Brilliant girl. Brilliant.  - Yes.
- 很有才华的女孩，很有才华  - 是的

119
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,638
Yes, they went to America, didn't they?
是的，他们去了美洲，是吗？

120
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:35,002
Oh, Travers was getting past it a bit, you know,
哦，Travers 有点老了, 你知道

121
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:37,043
and Anne persuaded him to go to America with her.
Anne 说服了他跟她一起去美洲

122
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:38,321
Oh, yes.
哦，是了

123
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,723
What are you doing here?
你在这里做什么？

124
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:43,123
Well, it's a long story.
啊，这就说来话长了

125
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:47,563
The strange Doctor
has been on another planet, Packer.
这个奇怪的博士到过其它星球，Packer

126
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:49,439
That's not possible!
那是不可能的

127
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:52,078
It is a fact, Packer.
这是事实，Packer

128
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:54,677
He has some sort of machine.
他有某种机器

129
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:59,240
Now let's see if we can
learn more about it, shall we?

130
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:00,999
Switch on, Packer.
打开吧，Packer

00:29:02,727 --> 00:29:04,080
With sound.

所以我们去找 Vaughn 先生

133
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,444
<i>and he said that you were working</i>
<i>on something important.</i>
他说你在做一个重要的项目

134
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:12,961
I see. That's why you wanted to
leave them alone together.
