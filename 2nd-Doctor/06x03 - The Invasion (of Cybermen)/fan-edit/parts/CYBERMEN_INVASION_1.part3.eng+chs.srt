Is any force being used?
有武力胁迫吗？

<i>Shall we follow?</i>

Over and out.

15
00:22:57,687 --> 00:23:00,145
- Sergeant Walters.
- Yes, sir?

Yes, they've just gone into the IE area, sir.
Shall I follow?
好, 他们已经进入了 IE 的区域, 长官．我要跟进去吗？

until we get a request from the Doctor.
不, 在那里盘旋．除非我们收到博士的请求, 否则我们什么也不能做

- 待命中，长官  - 还有，Jimmy，待在他们视线外

If Vaughn's private army see you,
they might well get the wind up,
如果 Vaughn 的私人武装看到你们，可能会搞事

25
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:54,278
and that might make things rather unhealthy
for the Doctor and the boy.
就有可能会让局面对博士和那个小伙子不利

26
00:23:57,747 --> 00:23:58,816
Hey!
嘿

27
00:24:03,147 --> 00:24:05,786
- Doctor, it's...
- Confusing, isn't it?
- 博士，这...  - 分不清了，是吧？

28
00:24:06,107 --> 00:24:08,063
It's exactly the same as your office in London.

In all basic essentials, yes, it is.

That's the secret of my success, you see.
这是我成功的秘诀，知道吗

31
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:14,263
Uniformity. Duplication.
匀称，一致

32
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:16,584
My whole empire is based on that principle.

00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,419
The very essence of business efficiency.

34
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:20,975
- Do sit down.
- DOCTOR: Oh, how kind.

35
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:29,176
I must say I'm rather glad
we have this opportunity to talk.
我必须要说我很高兴我们有机会进行这次谈话

36
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,461
Really?
真的？

37
00:24:31,507 --> 00:24:34,305
I should, of course, be angry with you.
当然，其实我应该生你们的气

38
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:38,422
You've thwarted my elaborate
security precautions twice.
你们挫败了我精心制定的安全预防措施，两次

00:24:38,747 --> 00:24:40,977
- I'd like to know why.
- Oh, that's quite simple.
- 我想知道为什么  - 哦，那很简单

40
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:44,298
I hate computers
and refuse to be bullied by them.
我讨厌电脑，拒绝被他们欺负

41
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:46,096
Your young friend Zoe.
你们的年轻朋友 Zoe

42
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:49,020
- Well, what about her?
- Well, she appears to have the same instincts.
- 哦，关她什么事  - 她似乎也有同样的直觉

43
00:24:49,107 --> 00:24:52,019
She so confused one of my computers
she ruined its memory store.
FIXME

44
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:55,417
So that's why your thugs
dragged her and Isobel away.
所以这就是为什么你那些暴徒会把她和 Isobel 拖走

45
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:58,021
My dear young man, I wasn't angry with her.
我亲爱的年轻人，我没生她的气

46
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:02,703
On the contrary, I found the incident
quite amusing. She's a remarkable girl.
恰恰相反，我发现这个事情很有意思。她是个非凡的人

47
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:07,579
And you, Doctor, are obviously a man
of no mean scientific ability.
而你，博士，显然是个科学能力不一般的人

48
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:09,016
Why do you say that?
你为什么这么说？

49
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:12,577
Well, my research department
found these quite fascinating.
哦，我的研究部发现这些东西很吸引人

50
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:16,023
There's a totally illogical factor
in their construction.

51
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:18,663
Are they of your own invention?
这是你自己发明的吗？

52
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:23,743
Ah, you're determined to guard your secret, I see.
啊，你下定了决心要保守你的秘密，我明白了

53
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:28,502
I don't blame you,
and I promise not to pry any more.
我不怪你，而且我保证不再打听了

54
00:25:29,507 --> 00:25:33,056

- Oh, how kind.
- 事实上，我会竭尽所能帮助你  - 噢，好心

55
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,017
Now, you say you came here
looking for Professor Watkins
现在，你们说来这里是找 Watkins 教授

56
00:25:36,107 --> 00:25:37,665
because you thought he might be able to help you.
说是因为你们觉得他也许可以帮助你们

57
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:38,782
Yes.
是的

58
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:42,337
Well, then I'll try to persuade him
to put aside his work and, um,
好，那我会试试看能否说服他把工作放一放

59
00:25:42,427 --> 00:25:44,782
concentrate his efforts on your behalf.
聚焦到你的事情上

60
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,698
Make yourself at home.
请随意

61
00:25:51,907 --> 00:25:53,183
Hey, look, you're not going to trust him, are you?
嘿，你没打算相信他吧，是吗？

62
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:56,905
- I mean, what about Zoe and Isobel?
- I haven't forgotten them, Jamie.
- 我是说，Zoe 和 Isobel 怎么办？- 我没忘记她们, Jamie

63
00:25:56,987 --> 00:25:58,864
They're in that box. I'm sure of it.
她们就在那里面，我敢肯定

64
00:25:58,947 --> 00:26:02,064
Jamie, we're not going to help Zoe
by annoying Mr Vaughn, are we?
Jamie，我们惹恼 Vaughn 先生并不能帮上 Zoe，对吗？

65
00:26:02,147 --> 00:26:04,217
I don't think you can annoy that man
even if you wanted to.
我觉得就是你想，你也不能惹恼那个家伙

66
00:26:04,307 --> 00:26:05,786
He's being as nice as pie.
他的脾气太好了

67
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:06,902
He's too nice.
他是有点太好了

68
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:08,864
- Yeah, but why should he be?
- I don't know.
- 是，但为什么他会这样？  - 我不知道

69
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:11,984
He's a little bit too interested
in these circuits for my liking.
他对这些电路有点太感兴趣了, 我不喜欢

70
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:14,501
Hey, do you think he knows
about the Tardis, then?
嘿，那，你觉得他知道 TARDIS 的事吗？

71
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:17,740
Well, I don't see how he could do.
我看不出他怎么能知道

72
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:22,457
No, well, perhaps this Professor Watkins
will be able to tell us what's going on around here.
不能。也许这位 Watkins 教授能告诉我们这里在搞什么

73
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:25,460
- Yes, but that's what's worrying me.
- What?
- 是，但让我困扰的也是这个  - 什么？

74
00:26:25,707 --> 00:26:27,466
Well, if Vaughn has anything to hide...
是这样，如果 Vaughn 有事情瞒着我们...

75
00:26:27,612 --> 00:26:29,766
why is he letting us talk to Watkins?
他为什么会让我们跟 Watkins 谈话？

76
00:26:30,227 --> 00:26:31,983
I'd think about it if I were you, Professor.
如果我是你，我就会考虑的，教授

77
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:35,539
After all, she is a pretty girl.
It'd be a shame to spoil all that.
毕竟，她是个漂亮的女孩儿，破坏掉的话就就太惭愧了

78
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,460
What a vicious sadist you are, Packer.
你是个多么恶毒的虐待狂啊，Packer

79
00:26:40,027 --> 00:26:42,143
I don't believe you, anyway.
我不相信你，不管怎样

80
00:26:42,987 --> 00:26:45,296
I don't make idle threats, Professor,
as you well know.
我不会做无谓的威胁，教授，你是知道的

81
00:26:45,387 --> 00:26:48,538
If you want to see that girl again in one piece,
I suggest you do as Mr Vaughn asks.
如果你还想见到那个女孩儿完整一块的话，我建议你按 Vaughn 先生说的做

82
00:26:48,627 --> 00:26:52,097
How do I know that you already
haven't harmed her, if you had got her.
如果说你们已经抓了她，我怎么知道还没有伤害她？

83
00:26:52,187 --> 00:26:54,701
You can take my word for that, Professor.
你可以得到我对此的承诺，教授

84
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,140
(LAUGHING) Your word.
你的承诺

85
00:26:56,227 --> 00:26:58,695
I know just how much value
I can place on that.
我可知道该对它估价几何

86
00:26:58,787 --> 00:27:01,347
Harsh words, Professor, harsh words.
话说过份了啊，教授，过份了

87
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:05,586
Any progress?
有什么进展？

88
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:11,540
- So you haven't yet completed the machine?
- No, and I don't intend to.
- 看来你还没有完成这个机器  - 没，而且我也没打算完成

89
00:27:11,627 --> 00:27:13,936
Oh, I think you will, Professor.
噢，我想你会的，教授

90
00:27:14,027 --> 00:27:15,983
Much as I detest violence,
虽然我很讨厌暴力

91
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:20,777
I find it difficult to restrain Packer's
indisputable talent for persuasion.
我发现很难抑制 Packer 那无可争辩的说服才能

92
00:27:22,427 --> 00:27:24,338
Your niece is in our custody,
你侄女在我们的监管之下

93
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:28,181
and unless you do as I ask,
I shall hand her over to Packer.
除非你按我的要求去做, 否则我就把她交给 Packer

94
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:30,579
The choice is yours.
选择是你的

95
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:37,181
If I do cooperate, will you let her go?
如果我合作，你们会放她走吗？

96
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:41,739
Oh, no, she's our guarantee,
but she'll come to no harm.
哦，不会，她是我们的保证，但她不会受到伤害

97
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:44,986
All right.
好吧

98
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:48,021
- But I must see Isobel first.
- Of course.
但我必须先见到 Isobel  - 当然

99
00:27:48,107 --> 00:27:50,541
Oh, there is just one other thing.
哦，还有一件事

100
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,425
Don't look at me so suspiciously,
my dear Professor.
别用这种怀疑的眼神看我，亲爱的教授

101
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:56,067
It's merely that there are some friends 
of yours here who wish to see you.
只不过这里有几位你的朋友想要见你

102
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:59,503
- Friends?
- Yes, they've gone to great pains to seek you out.
- 朋友？  - 是的，他们费尽心机把你找出来

103
00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:02,340
But I haven't been allowed visitors
since I came here.
但自从我到这里来，就不被允许会客

104
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:04,782
Why are you suddenly considerate?
你怎么突然这么贴心了？

105
00:28:04,867 --> 00:28:06,823
I might tell them everything.
我可能把一切都告诉他们？

106
00:28:06,907 --> 00:28:08,499
Everything?
一切？

107
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:11,260
My dear Professor,
you know nothing that can harm me.
亲爱的教授，能伤到我的事情你一点也不知道

108
00:28:11,347 --> 00:28:13,861
Besides, there's always Isobel
to consider, isn't there?
再说了，总还得考虑 Isobel 吧，是不？

109
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:17,417
- Or would you rather leave her to me?
- No, no, Packer.
- 或许你更愿意把她留给我？  - 不，不，Packer

110
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:20,544
The Professor's going to do exactly as we ask.
教授会严格按我们要求的做

111
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,466
Aren't you?
对吧？

112
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:25,485
Yes, of course, I remember
Anne Travers telling me about you.
是的，当然了，我记得 Anne Travers 跟我说起过你
<i>(Anne Travers, 老 Travers 教授的女儿，在 05x05 The Web of Fear 一集中他们父女俩与博士、UNIT一起对抗雪怪)</i>

113
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:27,683
She was a student of mine, 
you know, some years ago.
她是我的学生，知道吗，多年以前

114
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:29,325
- Brilliant girl. Brilliant.  - Yes.
- 很有才华的女孩，很有才华  - 是的

115
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,638
Yes, they went to America, didn't they?
是的，他们去了美洲，是吗？

116
00:28:32,727 --> 00:28:35,002
Oh, Travers was getting past it a bit, you know,
哦，Travers 有点老了

117
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:37,043
and Anne persuaded him
to go to America with her.

118
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:38,321
Oh, yes.
哦，是了

00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,723
What are you doing here?
你在这里做什么？

120
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:43,123
Well, it's a long story.
啊，这就说来话长了

121
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:47,563
The strange Doctor
has been on another planet, Packer.
这个奇怪的博士到过其它星球，Packer

122
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:49,439
That's not possible!
那是不可能的

123
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:52,078
It is a fact, Packer.
这是事实，Packer

124
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:54,677
He has some sort of machine.
他有某种机器

125
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:59,240
Now let's see if we can
learn more about it, shall we?

126
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:00,999
Switch on, Packer.

129
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,444
<i>and he said that you were working</i>
<i>on something important.</i>
他说你在做一个重要的项目

130
00:29:10,527 --> 00:29:12,961
I see. That's why you wanted to
leave them alone together.
我明白了，这就是为什么你要把他们俩单独留在一起

131
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:14,480
Exactly, Packer.
正是，Packer

132
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:15,602
(COMMUNICATOR HUMMING)

<i>on some electronic circuits that the Tardis had.</i>

the Professor wants to hear about that.
Jamie，Jamie，我觉得教授对这个不感兴趣

Oh, on the contrary, what Anne told me
about the Tardis was most intriguing.
噢，恰恰相反，Anne 所告诉我的那些 TARDIS 的事情是最吸引我的

I'd like to hear a lot more about it.

Professor, I think I should warn you

that Anne Travers allowed
her imagination to run a little wild.
Anne Travers 放任她的想象天马行空了

- Of course there is...
- Jamie, I think

142
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:39,086
there are other more important things
to talk about at the moment.

Oh, I see, yes.

I've been developing
a new kind of teaching machine.

- Oh, aye.
- 我把它叫做思维导师  - 哦，是

149
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:53,457
The main difference
from other teaching machines

150
00:29:53,547 --> 00:29:56,886
is that it's able to induce 
emotional changes in the subject.

151
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:58,286
JAMIE: Oh.

Our friend the Doctor is a resourceful man.

No wonder our allies fear him.

of 
this extraordinary machine of his.
但首先我必须掌握这台非凡机器的秘密

- 如果命令是要消灭他...  - 我不接受命令，Packer，我只下发命令！

to stop playing games with this Doctor!

But what can we do?

and your young friend,

What's he doing here?

I know no more than you do.

He's a ruthless man, without morals or principles.
他是个冷酷无情的人, 没有道德和原则

His object, I'm sure, is to get complete control
of the electronics industry of the world!

看来你抓了她！听着，如果你伤害她一根...

I want your travel machine, Doctor.
