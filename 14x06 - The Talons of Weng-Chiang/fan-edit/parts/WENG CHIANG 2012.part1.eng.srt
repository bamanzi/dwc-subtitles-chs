He was fished from the river,
but he wasn't drowned.

132
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:33,997
- Those marks suggest an animal.
- Exactly what I think,

That's impossible. Look at the size of them.

Have you established the cause of death?

137
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:49,561
That's another curious thing -
all this happened after death.

138
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,879
He was killed by a knife blow to the heart.

- Yes, sir.

140

- I'm taking them for examination.
- Hold that.

141
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:05,002
He was carrying no personal documents,

142
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:08,558
but this indicates he was a licensed cab driver.

143
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:10,878

- Some sort of hair.

- Yes, I think they're rat hairs.

147
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:27,240
- Rat hairs?! Do you know what you're saying?
- Of course I know what I'm saying.

148
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:31,681
It's three inches long -
hairs on a rat are only a quarter of an inch.
