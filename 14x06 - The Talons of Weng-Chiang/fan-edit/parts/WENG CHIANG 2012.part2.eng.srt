1
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:39,634
It's as black as Newgate's Knocker down here!

2
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:42,034
It's over this way, Mr Jago.

3
00:14:42,204 --> 00:14:45,753
Flickering shadows, Casey. Trick of the light.

4
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:48,802
Shadows don't groan, Mr Jago!

5
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:54,038
Shadows don't clank chains and moan
like all the demented souls in hell!

6
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:56,240
There's your ghost!

7
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:59,953
Six-Gun Sadie and her Wild West troupe
left that behind.

8
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:03,514
Old lumber sheet and ninepins,
that's what you saw!

9
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:06,596
It weren't that old thing! Anyway, I heard it!

10
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:09,597
Ah, Casey, you're a pixilated leprechaun!

11
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:13,837
The course of the River Fleet
runs right under the foundations.

12
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:16,837
What you heard was a clang
and the rush of water

13
00:15:17,004 --> 00:15:19,916
as they closed the sluice gates on the Thames.

14
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:23,918
It's easy for you to cast aspersions.
You weren't down here!

15
00:15:24,084 --> 00:15:26,234
Somebody else has been down here.

16
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:28,395
Have you got an admirer, Casey?

17
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:31,476
- A glove, is it?
- Yes, a lady's glove,

18
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:34,920
monogrammed E.B.
Perhaps the ghost dropped it, eh?

19
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:37,552
Come on. We've had enough of your spook!

20
00:15:37,364 --> 00:15:39,514
(JAGO ) Go on home. Straight home.

21
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:42,596
You might get mistaken for one of those girls!

22
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:45,198
- Aren't you coming, Mr Jago?
- Not yet.

23
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:47,798
Some paperwork commands my presence,

24
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:51,639
but I shall doubtless descry
those lugubrious liniments

25
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:53,795
- at the crepuscular hour!
- Eh?

26
00:15:53,964 --> 00:15:55,955
See you in the morning!

27
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:59,002
You're a card, Mr Jago, a card and a half!

28
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:07,242
Jiminy, you made me jump!
I thought you'd gone, Mr Chang!

29
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:10,157
No, Mr Jago, I have come back to see you.

30
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:13,839
See me, Mr Chang? Nothing wrong, I hope!

31
00:16:14,004 --> 00:16:18,236
Be so kind as to step up
to my dressing room and I will explain.

32
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:25,914
If it's the terms of our contract,

33
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,678
we've been attracting such good houses,

34
00:16:28,844 --> 00:16:31,914
I've already considered
drawing up a fresh agreement,

35
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:36,557
with terms that no other management
in London would offer an artiste!

36
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:41,195
What would you say to an extra
two per cent? Gross, naturally.

37
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:44,993
I think you'll agree that's...fair.

38
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:48,440
Now hear me, Jago.

39
00:16:48,604 --> 00:16:52,643
You remember the cab driver, Buller,
who came to see me tonight?

40
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,079
Cab driver? Yes.

41
00:16:55,244 --> 00:17:01,160
I want you to forget him,
understand? You did not see him.

42
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:03,121
I did not see him.

43
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:05,275
Good.

44
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:08,436
Now you will go from here to your office.

45
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:12,438
When you sit down at your desk,
you will remember only

46
00:17:12,604 --> 00:17:16,916
that you have just said goodnight
to Casey. Is that clear?

47
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:20,235
I have just said goodnight to Casey.

48
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:24,079
Excellent. Now, go!

49
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:44,436
- You are late!
- We should not go tonight, lord.

50
00:18:44,604 --> 00:18:49,075
I must - every night
until the time cabinet is found!

51
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:50,757
You are ill!

52
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:53,916
I am dying, Chang!

53
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:58,953
You must bring another linnet to my cage.

54
00:18:59,124 --> 00:19:02,355
- But only yesterday...
- The disease grows worse!

55
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:05,994
Each distillation lasts less than the time before!

56
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:11,443
And with every missing girl, panic increases.
I fear one will be traced here.

57
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:13,799
You must be careful!

58
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:16,194
There is always risk of discovery.

59
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,356
Even tonight I acted quickly to keep our secret.

60
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:23,802
- A man was on his way to police!
- Hah! Those dumb-witted oxen!

61
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:29,755
I have given you mental powers
undreamt of in this century!

62
00:19:29,924 --> 00:19:32,722
You are thousands of years ahead of your time.

63
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:37,400
- Why fear these primitives?
- True, I read their minds with ease,

64
00:19:37,564 --> 00:19:41,762
but tonight there was a man
whose thoughts were hidden.

65
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:44,313
- Describe him!
- He is a doctor - tall,

66
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:48,636
wide, pale eyes and hair that curls
like the ram. He ask many questions.

67
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:53,594
A time ancient would not ask questions!
A time ancient would know!

68
00:19:53,764 --> 00:19:56,517
I fear danger, and have sent a man to kill him.

69
00:19:56,684 --> 00:20:01,599
Your opium-addicted scum are bunglers!
You should have done it yourself!

70
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:05,677
If he troubles us further, lord,
I will deal with him personally.

71
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:07,960
Very well. We're wasting time. Come!

72
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:12,276
I took some organs for further tests,
but I admit to being beaten.

73
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,435
- Beaten?
- They were poisoned,

74
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:17,038
one orally, the other intravenously.

75
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:20,037
I understand you suggested scorpion venom?

76
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:24,243
- Yes, in concentrated form.
- Hmm, you're in this line, I take it?

77
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:26,237
- I've dabbled a bit.

78
00:20:26,884 --> 00:20:30,274
- What an amazing night it's been!
- It is not over yet.

79
00:20:30,444 --> 00:20:33,436
Most of the corpses around here are jolly dull.

80
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:35,595
Now I have two inscrutable Chinks

81
00:20:35,764 --> 00:20:38,597
and a poor perisher
who was chewed by a giant rat,

82
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:42,154
- having been stabbed by a midget!
- A midget?

83
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,803
Angle of the wound!

84
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:46,478
We shouldn't be discussing such things

85
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:49,795
in front of the fairer sex! Forgive us, ma'am!

86
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:52,273
- What for?
- For being so indelicate

87
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:54,958
in the presence of a lady of refinement!

88
00:20:55,124 --> 00:20:57,433
- Does he mean me?
- I don't think so.

89
00:20:57,604 --> 00:21:00,641
You say you can tell the height of the attacker

90
00:21:00,804 --> 00:21:02,920
by the way the blade was thrust,

91
00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:05,075
but when aiming for the heart,

92
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:08,281
we were taught to strike under the breastbone.

93
00:21:08,444 --> 00:21:10,639
Upon my soul!

94
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:14,877
Savage. Found floating
down the Amazon in a hat box!

95
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:18,400
- A hat box?
- (POLICEMAN) Professor, still here?

96
00:21:18,564 --> 00:21:23,433
I've traced our cab driver -
Joseph Buller, 14 Fish Lane, this parish.

97
00:21:23,604 --> 00:21:28,120
Splendid. You can tell the coroner.
Will someone identify the clothing?

98
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:32,755
His mother-in-law, Nelly Gusset.
Same address. Deceased has lived there

99
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:36,234
- since his marriage six month ago.
- Anything else?

100
00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:38,793
You had a few drinks with Mrs Gusset.

101
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:43,196
- Did she tell you anything further?
- A bearer of sad tidings, sir.

102
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:47,357
I shared a glass or two
while the poor thing got over the shock.

103
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:51,756
She did mention that the deceased
had been in a queer state all day.

104
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:53,403
Why?

105
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:57,034
It seems his wife, Emma Buller,
daughter of the house,

106
00:21:57,204 --> 00:21:59,195
didn't come home last night.

107
00:21:59,364 --> 00:22:04,199
Deceased had several drinks
and went round to the Palace Theatre.

108
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:08,482
- The theatre?
- Oh, not on pleasure bent, sir.

109
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:12,432
It seems he believed
that's where his wife was to be found.

110
00:22:12,604 --> 00:22:16,199
Mrs Gusset says he went off
making horrible asseverations

111
00:22:16,364 --> 00:22:17,763
as to his intentions.

112
00:22:17,924 --> 00:22:22,122
Well, put as much in the report
as you think will concern the coroner.

113
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:25,082
It's quite clear the man got stupidly drunk

114
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:28,156
and picked a fight with a dwarf!

115
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:30,679
Yes, sir.

116
00:22:30,844 --> 00:22:34,120
A night's work like that
does wonders for my appetite.

117
00:22:34,284 --> 00:22:37,594
- How about some supper?
- I'd be delighted.

118
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:47,039
The police will have the Buller case
cleared up in no time,

119
00:22:47,204 --> 00:22:50,355
but the Chinese, different kettle of fish, what?

120
00:22:50,524 --> 00:22:52,913
Why are you making fire in your mouth?

121
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:55,552
Hasn't the girl seen a pipe before?

122
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:58,716
There's no tobacco where Leela comes from.

123
00:22:58,884 --> 00:23:01,796
Sounds healthy but exceedingly dull!

124
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,798
Yes, as I was saying,
they're a mysterious lot, the Chinese.

125
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:10,116
Enigmatic. I've never understood them,
and I was brought up in China.

126
00:23:10,284 --> 00:23:12,752
Really? What were you doing there?

127
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:17,475
My father was Brigadier General
in the punitive expedition of 1860,

128
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:20,477
then he stayed in Peking as a palace attach�.

129
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:22,635
He died there, poor old buffer.

130
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:25,921
Fireworks at the funeral -
odd custom. Odd people.

131
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:28,518
- (BANGING)
- What's up?

132
00:23:28,684 --> 00:23:31,198
Fireworks frighten off evil spirits.

133
00:23:31,364 --> 00:23:34,083
I know that. Where are you going?

134
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:39,197
You stay with Litefoot. I'll join you later.

135
00:23:39,364 --> 00:23:42,674
- (LITEFOOT) Where are you going?
- Palace Theatre.

136
00:23:42,844 --> 00:23:45,278
There'll be nobody there at this hour!

137
00:23:47,044 --> 00:23:50,036
Extraordinary! I say, how can he join us later?

138
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:53,753
- I haven't given him a card!
- 4 Ranskill Gardens.

139
00:23:53,924 --> 00:23:55,915
He heard you tell the driver.

140
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:59,042
- He's as sharp as a trout!
- Trout?

141
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:03,879
- (KNOCKING)
- All right! Coming!

142
00:24:04,924 --> 00:24:07,358
Terrible weather for the time of year!

143
00:24:07,524 --> 00:24:09,515
- The theatre's closed!
- Sh!

144
00:24:10,604 --> 00:24:13,118
- What do you want?
- Are you the manager?

145
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:16,959
I'm the owner - Henry Gordon Jago,
at the end of a long day,

146
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:19,922
so if you'd kindly state your business...

147
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,279
How do you do, sir? I'm the Doctor.

148
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:23,843
- Doctor?
- Exactly!

149
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,757
I've rumbled your game!
I admire your brass, but it won't do!

150
00:24:28,924 --> 00:24:32,519
- Call back on Saturday.
- Don't move. Hold that.

151
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:40,363
Auditions commence at ten o'clock sharp!

152
00:24:40,524 --> 00:24:43,641
Supporting acts booked for one week only.

153
00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:53,123
Hmm?

154
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:57,444
- Is that all?
- No. Dramatic recitations.

155
00:24:57,604 --> 00:25:01,153
I play the Trumpet Voluntary
in a bowl of live goldfish.

156
00:25:01,324 --> 00:25:03,440
Don't bother coming back.

157
00:25:03,604 --> 00:25:07,995
I'm also a master hypnotist! Now then...

158
00:25:08,164 --> 00:25:11,554
..how long since you were
under the influence, sir?

159
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:14,955
I'm a man of character and determination, sir.

160
00:25:15,124 --> 00:25:18,514
The Rock of Gibraltar would be more easily...

161
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,720
..more easily...

162
00:25:20,884 --> 00:25:24,115
Just as I thought. And quite recently, too.

163
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:26,275
What was your last order?

164
00:25:26,444 --> 00:25:29,834
To remember nothing
since I said goodnight to Casey.

165
00:25:30,004 --> 00:25:32,916
Henry Gordon Jago,

166
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:37,077
I command you to remember everything
you were ordered to forget.

167
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,520
When I count to three,
you will remember everything.

168
00:25:40,684 --> 00:25:44,677
One...two...three...

169
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:48,678
..more easily influenced
than I would. I have a will of iron!

170
00:25:48,844 --> 00:25:51,199
What the dickens am I talking about?

171
00:25:51,364 --> 00:25:54,674
Did a cab driver come here tonight?

172
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:58,917
There was a fellow burst in
and accosted Mr Chang between shows.

173
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:01,996
- What did he want?
- Something about his Emma.

174
00:26:02,164 --> 00:26:05,315
- Lady friend, no doubt!
- Emma Buller, his wife.

175
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:08,760
She disappeared last night.
Does Mr Chang do a vanishing lady act?

176
00:26:08,924 --> 00:26:13,281
You're not suggesting Chang has
anything to do with these missing...

177
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:15,435
(DOCTOR) What is it?

178
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:19,117
Emma Buller...

179
00:26:22,004 --> 00:26:25,360
E.B... Where did you find this?

180
00:26:25,524 --> 00:26:28,322
In the cellar. Are you from the police?

181
00:26:28,484 --> 00:26:32,602
I'm helping them.
I'd like to see this cellar, Mr Jago.

182
00:26:33,364 --> 00:26:36,276
You're certain these are different streets?

183
00:26:36,444 --> 00:26:39,004
The driver has his orders.

184
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,962
Every night we quarter a new sector.

185
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:45,196
- How much longer?!
- Patience, lord.

186
00:26:45,364 --> 00:26:48,242
We know the time cabinet is here.

187
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,896
Ah, let's see what we have here.

188
00:26:53,064 --> 00:26:57,342
Mrs Hudson always leaves me
a cold collation. Ham, roast beef,

189
00:26:57,504 --> 00:27:01,497
chicken, tongue. Those look
like quail unless I'm much mistaken!

190
00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:03,143
Meat!

191
00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:06,023
Perhaps we shouldn't wait for the Doctor.

192
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:08,618
Help yourself. Plate's on the table.

193
00:27:08,784 --> 00:27:13,778
I'll, um... I'll just put a log or two on the fire.

194
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,613
It's good!

195
00:27:22,784 --> 00:27:26,459
- I'm so glad.
- Is something wrong?

196
00:27:26,624 --> 00:27:30,663
No, would you care for a knife or a fork?

197
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:40,460
It's a good knife. Aren't you going to eat?

198
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:42,933
Yes, yes.

199
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,662
Just going to eat.

200
00:27:54,024 --> 00:27:56,379
(HUMMING WHINE)

201
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,536
Stop! Stop!

202
00:27:59,704 --> 00:28:03,663
Somewhere here! Somewhere!

203
00:28:03,824 --> 00:28:06,463
One of these dwellings!

204
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:13,377
(REGULAR BEEP)

205
00:28:25,224 --> 00:28:29,456
This is the place, Chang!
The time cabinet is in there!

206
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:34,254
Leave the rest to your servants, lord.
Go back to your abode.

207
00:28:34,424 --> 00:28:37,222
I must have the time cabinet! (COUGHS)

208
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:42,412
Lord, your weakness grows. Go back.
Rest. I will bring the cabinet to you.

209
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:45,621
Very well, but do not fail me now, Chang!

210
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:56,854
Well, if there is a secret entrance,
it's expertly hidden.

211
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:03,094
(JANGLING)

212
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:06,255
How very interesting!

213
00:29:06,424 --> 00:29:08,415
(JAGO ) Oh!

214
00:29:09,064 --> 00:29:11,578
Do you know what this is?

215
00:29:11,744 --> 00:29:14,702
(DOCTOR SIGHS)

216
00:29:14,864 --> 00:29:18,857
Come on...Rock of Gibraltar (!)

217
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:34,775
Napkin.

218
00:29:36,064 --> 00:29:38,532
Oh, thank you, Professor.

219
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:44,539
The Doctor's taking a long time.
I hope he did note the address.

220
00:29:44,704 --> 00:29:47,855
- Great Scott!
- What is it?

221
00:29:48,024 --> 00:29:51,096
There's somebody out there watching the house.

222
00:29:51,264 --> 00:29:54,859
Someone stepped back
into the shrubbery as I looked out.

223
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:59,973
Some scoundrel up to no good!
Odd thing, I could swear he was a Chinese!

224
00:30:00,144 --> 00:30:04,535
Whoever he is, I'll give him more
than he expected! No, you wait here!

225
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:10,543
- How are you feeling?
- The ghost, I saw it!

226
00:30:10,704 --> 00:30:13,502
- Casey, forgive me!
- No, it was a hologram.

227
00:30:13,664 --> 00:30:17,339
I thought there was something
unnatural about that cellar!

228
00:30:17,504 --> 00:30:21,099
There's nothing unnatural
about a holograph technique -

229
00:30:21,264 --> 00:30:23,573
a projection of light by laser beam.

230
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,053
It wasn't known in this century.

231
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:29,694
- Drink this. You'll feel better.
- What was that?

232
00:30:31,544 --> 00:30:33,535
Sh!

233
00:31:30,364 --> 00:31:33,834
- Oh, Doctor!
- Cheer up, Jago. Cheer up!

234
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:42,203
(DESCENDING FOOTSTEPS)

235
00:31:42,964 --> 00:31:45,797
He's gone back to his rats. Are you all right?

236
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:48,558
Yes, I think so. Who the devil was it?

237
00:31:48,724 --> 00:31:51,477
I've no idea. He didn't introduce himself.

238
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:54,954
- Shall I call in the police?
- Oh, Henry Gordon Jago!

239
00:31:55,124 --> 00:31:59,481
Then our reclusive phantom
would simply vanish! Boof!

240
00:31:59,644 --> 00:32:03,637
- Good heavens, yes.
- We can tackle it together. You and I.

241
00:32:03,804 --> 00:32:06,193
What are you going to do?

242
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:09,561
Think. I'm going to have some supper!

243
00:32:36,564 --> 00:32:40,352
(LITEFOOT) Nobody out there.
Fellow must have got wind of...

244
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:42,515
(LITEFOOT GROANS...THUD )

245
00:32:42,684 --> 00:32:44,675
Professor?

246
00:32:45,604 --> 00:32:47,595
Are you there?

247
00:32:48,804 --> 00:32:50,203
Professor!
