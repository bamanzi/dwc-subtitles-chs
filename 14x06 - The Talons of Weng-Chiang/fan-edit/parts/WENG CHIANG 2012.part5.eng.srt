1
01:07:30,028 --> 01:07:32,019
Doctor!

2
01:07:34,348 --> 01:07:36,543
Litefoot's got visitors.

3
01:07:58,948 --> 01:08:00,939
(CHINESE LANGUAGE)
你好吗

4
01:08:01,108 --> 01:08:02,587
What happened?

5
01:08:02,748 --> 01:08:06,138
- Chinese! Dozens of them!
- What?

6
01:08:06,308 --> 01:08:08,663
Oh, the devils!

7
01:08:08,828 --> 01:08:12,059
Well, they got what they came for.

8
01:08:12,228 --> 01:08:14,025
- What?
- The time cabinet.

9
01:08:14,188 --> 01:08:16,497
- Damn scoundrels!
- Get him a drink.

10
01:08:20,548 --> 01:08:23,016
In a glass.

11
01:08:23,188 --> 01:08:27,545
- Professor, how did they get in?
- I've no idea.

12
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:32,020
I locked and bolted all the doors
as soon as you left! Thank you.

13
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:45,297
- Were they all Chinese?
- Tongwallahs - criminals!

14
01:08:45,468 --> 01:08:47,777
The gutter scrapings of Shanghai!

15
01:08:47,948 --> 01:08:51,418
- And one midget.
- Yes! How on earth did you deduce

16
01:08:51,588 --> 01:08:55,376
- that one was a midget?
- Elementary, my dear Litefoot.

17
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:58,585
He came in the laundry basket
and let the others in.

18
01:08:58,748 --> 01:09:01,137
The same creature that attacked me!

19
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:03,697
- The Peking Homunculus!
- Who?

20
01:09:20,608 --> 01:09:23,964
Liberation, Mr Sin! Freedom!

21
01:09:24,128 --> 01:09:27,404
I can become whole again! Whole and alive!

22
01:09:27,568 --> 01:09:30,287
Oh, I have dreamt of this moment -

23
01:09:30,448 --> 01:09:33,679
to be free of this putrefying carcass,

24
01:09:33,848 --> 01:09:37,363
to fashion myself anew
in some distant time and place!

25
01:09:37,528 --> 01:09:42,158
And I can do it now, now at last
that I have the time cabinet!

26
01:09:42,328 --> 01:09:44,125
I promise you, Mr Sin,

27
01:09:44,288 --> 01:09:49,646
we shall not remain long among
these filthy barbarians! Where is the bag?

28
01:09:50,808 --> 01:09:53,766
Answer me, you fools! Where is the bag?

29
01:09:55,048 --> 01:09:58,358
It was... We did not...

30
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:03,158
- The bag, you cowering oaf!
- It was left behind, great lord.

31
01:10:03,328 --> 01:10:05,159
What?!

32
01:10:05,328 --> 01:10:07,319
(SCREAMS) What?!

33
01:10:08,888 --> 01:10:11,766
Lee! Lee!

34
01:10:11,928 --> 01:10:16,797
I told you to take it
out to the carriage! I ordered you!

35
01:10:18,768 --> 01:10:23,478
You know the penalty for failing me!

36
01:10:25,328 --> 01:10:29,446
Take the sting of the scorpion!

37
01:10:44,848 --> 01:10:48,523
(WENG-CHIANG AND MR SIN LAUGH)

38
01:10:57,608 --> 01:10:59,087
Thank you!

39
01:11:01,248 --> 01:11:04,877
Kindly tell your employer
that Mr Jago wishes to see him!

40
01:11:05,048 --> 01:11:08,085
- What?
- Your employer, Professor Litefoot!

41
01:11:08,248 --> 01:11:12,526
- May I ask, sir, who you are?
- Confound your insolence! Announce me!

42
01:11:12,688 --> 01:11:15,600
Consider yourself announced! I'M Litefoot!

43
01:11:15,768 --> 01:11:19,602
Why, dash me optics! I should have realised!

44
01:11:19,768 --> 01:11:22,441
That brow, those hands,

45
01:11:22,608 --> 01:11:26,078
England's peerless premier
professor of pathology!

46
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:28,887
Henry Gordon Jago, sir, at your service!

47
01:11:29,048 --> 01:11:32,836
Mr Jago, just tell me what all this is about!

48
01:11:33,008 --> 01:11:35,078
- The Doctor.
- What?

49
01:11:35,248 --> 01:11:37,045
This bag!

50
01:11:37,648 --> 01:11:40,116
Shall we go inside?

51
01:11:42,528 --> 01:11:46,680
Found this in my cellar.
Thought the Doctor might be interested.

52
01:11:46,848 --> 01:11:49,885
- It may concern those Chineses.
- The Chinese?

53
01:11:50,048 --> 01:11:55,122
I considered going to Scotland Yard,
where he's held in the highest esteem.

54
01:11:55,288 --> 01:11:58,644
- The Doctor is?
- Of course. He solves half their cases

55
01:11:58,808 --> 01:12:01,641
while they take the credit, don't you agree?

56
01:12:01,808 --> 01:12:04,766
- I have no idea.
- It stands to reason.

57
01:12:04,928 --> 01:12:07,123
I mean, they're policemen!

58
01:12:07,288 --> 01:12:10,280
We all know they're solid, sterling fellows,

59
01:12:10,448 --> 01:12:13,918
but their buttons
are the brightest thing about them!

60
01:12:14,088 --> 01:12:16,397
Now, the Doctor's a real detective.

61
01:12:16,568 --> 01:12:21,483
Yes, he's certainly very active.
How did you learn of my connection with him?

62
01:12:21,648 --> 01:12:26,802
I enquired at the local station
and they told me that you'd been seen together.

63
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:31,041
The most formidable combination
in the annals of criminology!

64
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:35,406
It's a great honour to be working
with you on this devilish affair!

65
01:12:35,568 --> 01:12:41,040
Thank you! I'm sure the Doctor will be
very interested in these things.

66
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:43,881
Unfortunately, he isn't here at present.

67
01:12:44,048 --> 01:12:46,084
The sleuth that never rests, eh?

68
01:12:46,248 --> 01:12:49,160
Well, he did remark that sleep is for tortoises.

69
01:12:49,328 --> 01:12:54,527
I can't for the life of me discern
what purposes these articles might serve.

70
01:12:54,688 --> 01:12:58,237
It's a queer lot of paraphernalia.
I thought so meself.

71
01:12:58,408 --> 01:13:02,083
And they were left by Weng-Chiang,
this murderous lunatic?

72
01:13:02,248 --> 01:13:06,844
They're nothing to do with the theatre.
The bag was amongst our old junk.

73
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:12,401
In that case, Mr Jago, is it not possible
that someone plans to return for it?

74
01:13:12,568 --> 01:13:15,878
Yes, yes - good point.
We must tell the Doctor.

75
01:13:16,048 --> 01:13:19,802
Or take a hand ourselves.
Well, the Doctor isn't here.

76
01:13:19,968 --> 01:13:23,040
If you and I keep a discreet watch
on the theatre,

77
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:25,722
we might get a chance to nab this fellow!

78
01:13:25,888 --> 01:13:28,960
You're suggesting a pernoctation, Professor.

79
01:13:29,128 --> 01:13:33,280
Unfortunately, the nocturnal vapours
are very bad for my chest.

80
01:13:33,448 --> 01:13:36,679
You can wrap up!
I'll lend you some extra clothing!

81
01:13:36,848 --> 01:13:40,523
- Very kind, I'm sure.
- Now, you write a note to the Doctor,

82
01:13:40,688 --> 01:13:43,202
and I'll look you out a cape!

83
01:13:43,368 --> 01:13:45,836
We might be lucky, Mr Jago,

84
01:13:46,008 --> 01:13:49,205
and if we are, I've a few lumps to repay!

85
01:13:52,248 --> 01:13:55,126
This is their hideaway, no doubt about it.

86
01:13:55,288 --> 01:13:59,759
It's unfortunate there were too many
for us to tackle, eh, Professor?

87
01:13:59,928 --> 01:14:04,001
- I was itching for a scrap!
- The question is, what now?

88
01:14:04,168 --> 01:14:08,161
We could adjourn for liquid refreshment.
I know a spot nearby.

89
01:14:08,328 --> 01:14:11,923
One of us should stay
while the other fetches the Doctor.

90
01:14:12,088 --> 01:14:16,479
- Good idea. I'll be as quick as I can!
- Too late, old man.

91
01:14:16,648 --> 01:14:18,047
(JAGO ) Oh, corks!

92
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:20,199
Backs to the wall.

93
01:14:20,368 --> 01:14:23,838
Keep off, you lot!
I'm a tiger when my dander's up!

94
01:14:40,248 --> 01:14:46,323
(WENG-CHIANG) So...you choose
to pry on the House of the Dragon?

95
01:14:46,488 --> 01:14:52,120
Unwise! Very unwise! You will suffer for it!

96
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:55,678
You'll be the sufferer when the police get here!

97
01:14:55,848 --> 01:14:56,203
(LAUGHING) The police (?)

98
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:59,223
Mr Sin, they take me for a simpleton!

99
01:14:59,388 --> 01:15:01,822
They'll be here, don't you worry!

100
01:15:01,988 --> 01:15:04,297
You told them where you were coming?

101
01:15:04,468 --> 01:15:07,540
Of course. We're not
completely without sense!

102
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:12,543
Lies! You didn't know where this was!
You followed my men from the theatre!

103
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:16,701
- If that's what you believe...
- Why were you at the theatre?

104
01:15:16,868 --> 01:15:18,381
Answer me!

105
01:15:18,548 --> 01:15:21,585
- Why were we at the theatre?
- I refuse to answer!

106
01:15:21,748 --> 01:15:25,297
- You can do with us as you wish!
- I say, steady on!

107
01:15:25,468 --> 01:15:27,538
Very well, I will tell you why.

108
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:32,862
- You were waiting to see...
- You don't know your own strength!

109
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:36,623
- ..who came to collect the bag!
- You're choking me!

110
01:15:36,788 --> 01:15:39,461
Where is the bag?
What have you done with it?

111
01:15:39,628 --> 01:15:42,620
- Let him go!
- The bag! Tell me!

112
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:46,064
It's at my house.
Now, for pity's sake, release him!

113
01:15:46,228 --> 01:15:51,780
You will die later - slowly!
It will give pleasure to my wolves.

114
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:54,382
You filthy bounder!

115
01:15:54,548 --> 01:15:57,858
In the meantime,
put them with the other prisoners.

116
01:16:04,988 --> 01:16:07,218
(DOCTOR) Litefoot! Litefoot!

117
01:16:11,148 --> 01:16:15,778
''My dear Doctor, contained in this bag,
which I discovered in the cellar,

118
01:16:15,948 --> 01:16:19,418
''is a collection of sundry items
of baffling meaning.

119
01:16:19,588 --> 01:16:23,376
''The Professor and I are keeping
observation on the theatre.

120
01:16:23,548 --> 01:16:25,539
''Your fellow detective H.G.J.''

121
01:16:29,408 --> 01:16:31,399
(JAGO ) Are they dead?

122
01:16:31,748 --> 01:16:33,943
Drugged, I think.

123
01:16:34,108 --> 01:16:36,576
You know why they're here.

124
01:16:36,748 --> 01:16:38,026
Poor creatures! 

125
01:16:41,588 --> 01:16:45,263
Ah! Eureka! Do you know what that is?

126
01:16:45,428 --> 01:16:48,625
You ask me so that you can tell me!

127
01:16:48,788 --> 01:16:52,859
That's right. It's a trionic lattice,
an integral part of a time cabinet.

128
01:16:52,928 --> 01:16:54,919
It can't be opened without it.

129
01:16:55,088 --> 01:16:58,078
- It's a key?
- Yes. He's not only a scientific fool,

130
01:16:58,148 --> 01:17:02,061
- he's an absent-minded one!
- Perhaps he has another ''Eureka''.

131
01:17:02,228 --> 01:17:05,140
No, ''Eureka'' is Greek for ''this bath is too hot''.

132
01:17:05,308 --> 01:17:07,220
There can never be another of this combination.

133
01:17:07,268 --> 01:17:10,385
Dammit, Jago, I don't see any way out of this.

134
01:17:10,548 --> 01:17:14,143
- I think we're done for!
- You're forgetting the Doctor!

135
01:17:14,308 --> 01:17:18,779
- How can he find this place?
- A fleck of mud, a speck of paint,

136
01:17:18,948 --> 01:17:22,258
clues that speak volumes
to an investigator like him!

137
01:17:22,428 --> 01:17:25,386
I'll wager he's on our tracks this very minute!

138
01:17:25,548 --> 01:17:27,345
- Look at this!
- What of it?

139
01:17:27,508 --> 01:17:32,787
- Don't you see? It's a dumb waiter!
- Frankly, I'm not very peckish.

140
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:34,745
How can you think of food?

141
01:17:34,908 --> 01:17:36,660
I'm not thinking of food!

142
01:17:36,828 --> 01:17:41,026
I'm thinking that if we take that shelf out
and squeeze ourselves in,

143
01:17:41,188 --> 01:17:44,703
we can make a surreptitious exit
via the dining room!

144
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:47,905
By jiminy, you're right!

145
01:17:48,068 --> 01:17:50,901
We'll teach those blighters a lesson yet!

146
01:17:51,068 --> 01:17:55,619
They picked the wrong man
when they decided to cross swords with me!

147
01:17:58,148 --> 01:18:00,662
After you, Mr Jago.

148
01:18:00,828 --> 01:18:04,138
Those ropes don't look too sound, do they?

149
01:18:04,308 --> 01:18:06,538
''He that is down need fear no fall!''

150
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:08,699
- Hmm?
- A quotation - Bunyan.

151
01:18:08,868 --> 01:18:10,859
(JAGO ) Very comforting!

152
01:18:16,348 --> 01:18:19,545
- Mind your elbow, Professor!
- Sorry!

153
01:18:22,388 --> 01:18:24,948
(BOTH SHOUT) Heave!

154
01:18:50,548 --> 01:18:54,905
- This isn't the dining room!
- This isn't the way out either.

155
01:19:03,348 --> 01:19:08,786
We must trap them in the crossfire, Doctor,
in the open where they cannot find cover.

156
01:19:08,948 --> 01:19:12,577
What sort of crossfire?
Hazelnuts? Bread pellets?

157
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,216
A house this size must have protection.

158
01:19:15,388 --> 01:19:20,018
The professor will have weapons
in fixed positions to guard the approaches.

159
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:24,500
I brought you to the wrong time,
my girl. You'd have loved Agincourt!
