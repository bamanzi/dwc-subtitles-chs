1
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,739
Anyone would think we got rats up here.

2
00:01:24,988 --> 00:01:25,978
Who's that?!

3
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:33,974
WHO IS THAT?!

4
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:00,839
Doctor, do something!

5
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:02,616
I'm trying to!

6
00:03:16,893 --> 00:03:18,077
Everything back under control again.

7
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:22,967
Here, we're landing! Look!

8
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:24,866
Coming at a fair rate!

9
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:44,902
Oh, thank the lord for that. You know, Doctor, I'll never ask you to do that again.

10
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:50,238
There must be a reason for that.

11
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:58,591
Hey, wait a mo! This doesn't look like Mars to me.

12
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:00,533
How do you know? You never seen it.

13
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:04,959
No, Duchess, but I have seen pictures of the moon surface and that's what this looks like.

14
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:06,624
That's the moon?

15
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,223
Doctor, is it the moon?

16
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:16,954
Oh well, you weren't too far out, were you? Only two hundred million miles!

17
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:22,152
All right, let's move on - while we can.

18
00:04:23,207 --> 00:04:27,869
- What!
- Now wait a minute! You don't expect to land us on the moon and let us fly off just like that, do you?

19
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,254
Yeah, at least let us have a look around!

20
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:33,254
That picture canna be the moon? The moon's way up in the sky.

21
00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:34,525
Where do you think you're going?

22
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,108
You're not going to tell us there is no shore leave.

23
00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:39,647
Oh please Doctor. The TARDIS isn't out of control or anything is it?

24
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:42,395
Oh no, no, no. Just a bumpy landing. That's all 

25
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,534
Yeah?

26
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:46,951
Well, if you must go ashore... only half an hour.

27
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,643
- Right.
- Superb

28
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:53,333
You can't go ashore like that! You need space suits, there's no atmosphere out there. Come on, there's some in the chest.

29
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,821
Maybe we'll meet the old man in the moon.

30
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:04,930
You won't meet anybody mate if you don't get some gear on.

31
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,091
What? Oh aye.

32
00:05:19,094 --> 00:05:21,112
Come on now, lets go over here.

33
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:23,694
Hey, look at this.

34
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:25,462
Its deserted.

35
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:27,238
Yeah, I don't think I like it.

36
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:31,663
Hey, what do we need this great clogs for?

37
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:33,608
Try a little jump.

38
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:36,147
All right.

39
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:56,493
Careful! One tear in that space suit and you'll suffocate.

40
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,682
Come on, it's easy.

41
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,074
Look out, here I come.

42
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:11,082
Where's he gone?

43
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,047
Over there.

44
00:06:19,258 --> 00:06:21,724
What on Earth? Look!

45
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:23,472
Blimey! What is it?

46
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:24,948
Doctor, what is it?

47
00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:26,532
I don't know.

48
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:28,545
Hey, I can see Jamie, there he is.

49
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:31,213
Hey, there's somebody coming out.

50
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:33,960
Come on, let's go.

51
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:16,344
And... Jules, you take over.

52
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:26,515
There must be some source to this infection.  
Look, then get the lads in here and tell them what's happening. Get them on the blower would you, Nils.

53
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:37,365
Hello. Where did you lot spring from? Don't tell me the shuttle rocket arrived already?

54
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:38,289
No, it hasn't.

55
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:44,415
There was another one with them, sir. Bob taken him along to the Medical unit. He's all right. He's just knocked himself out or something.

56
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:46,791
Oh no, if we haven't got enough troubles already.

57
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:50,590
We don't want to cause you any trouble. Just let us collect our young friend and we'll be off.

58
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:52,395
Hey, not so fast.

59
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:54,296
Please let me go and see Jamie.

60
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,449
I will take you there Mademoiselle. If you come with me.

61
00:07:57,975 --> 00:07:59,901
All right, young lady. You can carry on.

62
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:01,189
This way.

63
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:05,074
Well, you know what this place is?

64
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:09,954
Well, it looks like some sort of weather control centre.

65
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:14,129
Ah, yes. And that's the thing with which you control the weather. That's the culprit then.

66
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:15,014
Hey?

67
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:17,937
Hmmm. That's what gave us a bumpy landing.

68
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:18,774
- Hm-Hmm.
- I see

69
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,543
The gravitron controls the tides, the tides controls the weather.

70
00:08:22,762 --> 00:08:25,549
And from this console we can plot it all on that map.

71
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:27,157
Simple, eh?

72
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:28,750
Yeah, very simple.

73
00:08:36,894 --> 00:08:39,043
It's Jim. Quick Francois, take over.

74
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:57,007
International Space Control Earth calling Weather Control Moon - come in please.

75
00:08:57,197 --> 00:08:58,386
Moonport - standing by.

76
00:08:58,562 --> 00:09:01,071
It's never done that before, Doctor.

77
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:02,079
Hobson here.

78
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:11,674
What's happening up there? The hurricane you were guiding is now 45 degrees off course. It's threatening Hawaii.

79
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,133
One of my men were taken ill. We're operational again now.

80
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,018
The controller would like to know the cause of the illness.

81
00:09:20,274 --> 00:09:27,833
Yes, so would we. We now have three men down with this mysterious virus in the past few hours - including the Doctor.

82
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:34,078
One moment please. Stand by for further instructions.

83
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:40,737
Just hang on for another couple of minutes lads. We better hear what the great Mr. Rinberg has to say.

84
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,182
We're being monitored again.

85
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,333
Monitored?

86
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:48,874
Someone, not too far away from the base, is listening to every word we say.

87
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:55,338
"Moonbase, Moonbase, come in Moonbase. "

88
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:57,166
Still standing by.

89
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:05,189
If you radio information about this virus, we can do our best to identify it and suggest treatment.

90
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,764
I demand to speak to Rinberg.

91
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:15,180
The controller is busy - I'm sorry. Over and out.

92
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:21,122
That whole conversion was monitored by someone or something.

93
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:28,850
Oh, never mind about that now. That Rinberg fellow won't talk to you. How can we trace down this mystery illness with the Doctor himself down with it.

94
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:32,991
We better get out of these things and see how Jamie is. Perhaps I can be of help in the sick bay now.

95
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,842
Anything you can do... Bob!

96
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:35,985
Yes, Mr Hobson?

97
00:10:36,154 --> 00:10:37,294
Show them to the Medical unit will you?

98
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,621
Yes, of course. Now, if you will come this way, please?

99
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,574
Yes. Thank you.

100
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:56,552
Well, you all heard the position. We don't know what this inflection is and how it got into the base but I want you all to take extra precautions while this emergency is on. We may be short-handed for quite a while.

101
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:57,882
Is this how its goes, Doctor?

102
00:10:58,114 --> 00:11:03,207
Yes, that's right. Then, this unit automatically controls the pulse, the temperature and the breathing.

103
00:11:03,403 --> 00:11:04,761
A sort of electronic Doctor.

104
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,810
Yes.

105
00:11:05,892 --> 00:11:07,432
And it even give you medicines too.

106
00:11:07,604 --> 00:11:09,488
Yes. It will do very nearly everything.

107
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:11,267
How do you think he is, Doctor?

108
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,992
Oh, he's not too bad. He's a bit concussed and feverish but he'll be all right with rest.

109
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:20,761
The Piper! The McCrimmon Piper! Don't let him get me!

110
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:21,846
Piper?

111
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:28,934
Some legend of his clan. As far, as I can make out - this piper appears to a McCrimmon just before he dies.

112
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:31,349
Has this phantom piper appeared to Jamie yet?

113
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:32,968
You don't believe it, do you?

114
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:35,354
No, but he does. It's important to him.

115
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,012
He keeps asking us to keep the piper away from him.

116
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:41,356
Good. We can see if we can do just that.

117
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,816
Well, carry on Nurse.

118
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:50,131
Well, at least I try to help. There's a ward full of sick men and no doctor. Somebody got to do something.

119
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:54,155
I wonder who this is?

120
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:57,486
Don't get too near. Have a look on his chart.

121
00:11:57,728 --> 00:11:59,245
That's a good idea.

122
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:00,497
It's Dr. Evans.

123
00:12:00,683 --> 00:12:03,437
Oh, yes. The station doctor. He was the first one to get it.

124
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,204
He looks one of the worst.

125
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:13,750
There's something about this epidemic that I... I just don't understand. It's not like a real disease at all! It's almost like...

126
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:15,580
Not real! What more do you want?

127
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,950
I don't know. But there are certain signs and symptoms which don't add up.

128
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,814
Ben, I want you to go to the control room and keep an eye on things.

129
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:24,693
But how?

130
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:27,210
Give a hand, do anything but keep your eyes and ears open.

131
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:28,094
Right.

132
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:31,687
There's something very wrong here. Something very wrong indeed.

133
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:42,663
Still up, Nobby. Why not take a rest. Go and get some sleep.

134
00:12:42,854 --> 00:12:57,934
Oh, How can I rest with that thing up the spout. You know the score as well as I do. 
Five units off centre and we lift half London into space! Five more and the Atlantic water level goes up three feet! 
Rinberg don't understand the pressure we're under.

135
00:12:58,036 --> 00:13:01,097
Hey you! What do you thinking you are doing?! Skulking here?

136
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:03,290
Just wondering if I can help, sir.

137
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,664
Well, how can you help?

138
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,170
We can do with an extra pair of hands - he can help me.

139
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:11,765
Well, keep him away from me, that's all. All right, I'll go and lie down. Call me if anything happens.

140
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,840
Yes, of course.

141
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:18,751
Oh, by the way, there were two more of those momentary drops in air pressure while I was on. I have put them in the log.

142
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,697
Right.

143
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:22,154
What is that?

144
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:27,429
Shhhh, it's all right Polly. It's only me. We don't want to wake everybody up do we?

145
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:35,740
You look if you can do with some sleep yourself.

146
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,885
I'm all right.

147
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:40,468
What have you got there?

148
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:42,858
Oh, I been doing a little investigation.

149
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:45,029
A piece of silver paper. What is it?

150
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:46,188
I don't know.

151
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:48,314
What's happened?!

152
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:51,551
Oh, it's nothing. It probably just a changeover in the time cycle.

153
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,118
What do you mean?

154
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:59,914
Oh, you see - it's rather interesting really - you see on the moon, they have a fortnight of days and a fortnight of nights.

155
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:00,882
Well?

156
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:08,399
Well, it's oblivious isn't it? They have to make their own day and night artificially up there - or it would upset their own biological time clock.

157
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:09,674
Their what?

158
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:13,476
They won't know if they were coming or going. Get it?

159
00:14:13,737 --> 00:14:14,623
Yes.

160
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:18,425
Clever girl. QED. That's why it's dark up here.

161
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:21,877
Oh, I see what you mean. Yes, of course. How stupid of me.

162
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:25,314
Of course along the control centre it's probably broad daylight.

163
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:28,393
Polly, you wouldn't be making fun of me would you?

164
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:29,657
No.

165
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,972
Dr. Evans.

166
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:48,071
The hand. No, don't touch me. No. The silver hand.

167
00:14:57,809 --> 00:14:59,545
Doctor, is he...

168
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:03,982
Yes, I'm afraid he is.

169
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:14,018
What are we gone to do?

170
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:19,088
What does he means by the silver hand. I better report this to Mr. Hobson.

171
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,405
What's the matter?

172
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:49,529
Something just went out of that door!

173
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:51,017
Nils! John!

174
00:15:51,186 --> 00:15:52,251
What was it?

175
00:15:57,852 --> 00:15:59,830
Nothing. Nothing there.

176
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:10,295
Your nerves are getting the better of you. Where's Evan's body?

177
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:11,521
Over there.

178
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,402
All right, let's get it over with.

179
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:29,679
Is this somebody's idea of a particularly bad joke?

180
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:31,285
This is no joke, believe me!

181
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:37,456
Mr. Hobson, Mr. Hobson, you are wanted! Another man's collapsed at the controls and the Gravitron has been thrown off alignment again.

182
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:38,390
Come on!

183
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,463
And you better find that Doctor's body or out you all go - quarantine or no quarantine.

184
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:55,252
I don't understand what could have happened. I must have dozed off or something but one thing I am sure of - something went out of that door just as you came in.

185
00:16:55,301 --> 00:16:59,180
That body can't just have vanished. Polly, I am going to leave you alone...

186
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,356
...just for a minute.

187
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:01,789
All right.

188
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:05,102
Water. Water.

189
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,133
I'll go and get you some.

190
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:08,461
Water!

191
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:42,126
It's you! The phantom piper!
