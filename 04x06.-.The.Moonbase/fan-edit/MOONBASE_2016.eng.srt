Who's that?!

00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:33,974

00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:00,839
Doctor, do something!

13
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:02,616
I'm trying to!

14
00:03:16,893 --> 00:03:18,077
Everything back under control again.

15
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:22,967
Here, we're landing! Look!

16
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:24,866
Coming at a fair rate!

17
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:44,902
Oh, thank the lord for that. You know, Doctor, I'll never ask you to do that again.

18
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:50,238
There must be a reason for that.

19
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:58,591
Hey, wait a mo! This doesn't look like Mars to me.

20
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:00,533
How do you know? You never seen it.

21
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:04,959
No, Duchess, but I have seen pictures of the moon surface and that's what this looks like.

22
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:06,624
That's the moon?

23
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,223
Doctor, is it the moon?

24
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:16,954
Oh well, you weren't too far out, were you? Only two hundred million miles!

25
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:22,152
All right, let's move on - while we can.

26
00:04:23,207 --> 00:04:27,869
- What!
- Now wait a minute! You don't expect to land us on the moon and let us fly off just like that, do you?

27
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,254
Yeah, at least let us have a look around!

28
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:33,254
That picture canna be the moon? The moon's way up in the sky.

29
00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:34,525
Where do you think you're going?

30
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,108
You're not going to tell us there is no shore leave.

31
00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:39,647
Oh please Doctor. The TARDIS isn't out of control or anything is it?

32
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:42,395
Oh no, no, no. Just a bumpy landing. That's all 

33
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,534
Yeah?

34
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:46,951
Well, if you must go ashore... only half an hour.

35
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,643
- Right.
- Superb

36
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:53,333
You can't go ashore like that! You need space suits, there's no atmosphere out there. Come on, there's some in the chest.

37
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,821
Maybe we'll meet the old man in the moon.

38
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:04,930
You won't meet anybody mate if you don't get some gear on.

39
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,091
What? Oh aye.

40
00:05:19,094 --> 00:05:21,112
Come on now, lets go over here.

41
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:23,694
Hey, look at this.

42
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:25,462
Its deserted.

43
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:27,238
Yeah, I don't think I like it.

44
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:31,663
Hey, what do we need this great clogs for?

45
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:33,608
Try a little jump.

46
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:36,147
All right.

47
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:56,493
Careful! One tear in that space suit and you'll suffocate.

48
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,682
Come on, it's easy.

49
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,074
Look out, here I come.

50
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:11,082
Where's he gone?

51
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,047
Over there.

52
00:06:19,258 --> 00:06:21,724
What on Earth? Look!

53
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:23,472
Blimey! What is it?

54
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:24,948
Doctor, what is it?

55
00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:26,532
I don't know.

56
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:28,545
Hey, I can see Jamie, there he is.

57
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:31,213
Hey, there's somebody coming out.

58
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:33,960
Come on, let's go.

59
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:16,344
And... Jules, you take over.

60
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:26,515
There must be some source to this infection.  
Look, then get the lads in here and tell them what's happening. Get them on the blower would you, Nils.

61
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:37,365
Hello. Where did you lot spring from? Don't tell me the shuttle rocket arrived already?

62
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:38,289
No, it hasn't.

63
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:44,415
There was another one with them, sir. Bob taken him along to the Medical unit. He's all right. He's just knocked himself out or something.

64
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:46,791
Oh no, if we haven't got enough troubles already.

65
00:07:46,896 --> 00:07:50,590
We don't want to cause you any trouble. Just let us collect our young friend and we'll be off.

66
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:52,395
Hey, not so fast.

67
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:54,296
Please let me go and see Jamie.

68
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,449
I will take you there Mademoiselle. If you come with me.

69
00:07:57,975 --> 00:07:59,901
All right, young lady. You can carry on.

70
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:01,189
This way.

71
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:05,074
Well, you know what this place is?

72
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:09,954
Well, it looks like some sort of weather control centre.

73
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:14,129
Ah, yes. And that's the thing with which you control the weather. That's the culprit then.

74
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:15,014
Hey?

75
00:08:15,215 --> 00:08:17,937
Hmmm. That's what gave us a bumpy landing.

76
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:18,774
- Hm-Hmm.
- I see

77
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,543
The gravitron controls the tides, the tides controls the weather.

78
00:08:22,762 --> 00:08:25,549
And from this console we can plot it all on that map.

79
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:27,157
Simple, eh?

80
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:28,750
Yeah, very simple.

81
00:08:36,894 --> 00:08:39,043
It's Jim. Quick Francois, take over.

82
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:57,007
International Space Control Earth calling Weather Control Moon - come in please.

83
00:08:57,197 --> 00:08:58,386
Moonport - standing by.

84
00:08:58,562 --> 00:09:01,071
It's never done that before, Doctor.

85
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:02,079
Hobson here.

86
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:11,674
What's happening up there? The hurricane you were guiding is now 45 degrees off course. It's threatening Hawaii.

87
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,133
One of my men were taken ill. We're operational again now.

88
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,018
The controller would like to know the cause of the illness.

89
00:09:20,274 --> 00:09:27,833
Yes, so would we. We now have three men down with this mysterious virus in the past few hours - including the Doctor.

90
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:34,078
One moment please. Stand by for further instructions.

91
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:40,737
Just hang on for another couple of minutes lads. We better hear what the great Mr. Rinberg has to say.

92
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,182
We're being monitored again.

93
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,333
Monitored?

94
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:48,874
Someone, not too far away from the base, is listening to every word we say.

95
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:55,338
"Moonbase, Moonbase, come in Moonbase. "

96
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:57,166
Still standing by.

97
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:05,189
If you radio information about this virus, we can do our best to identify it and suggest treatment.

98
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,764
I demand to speak to Rinberg.

99
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:15,180
The controller is busy - I'm sorry. Over and out.

100
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:21,122
That whole conversion was monitored by someone or something.

101
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:28,850
Oh, never mind about that now. That Rinberg fellow won't talk to you. How can we trace down this mystery illness with the Doctor himself down with it.

102
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:32,991
We better get out of these things and see how Jamie is. Perhaps I can be of help in the sick bay now.

103
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,842
Anything you can do... Bob!

104
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:35,985
Yes, Mr Hobson?

105
00:10:36,154 --> 00:10:37,294
Show them to the Medical unit will you?

106
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,621
Yes, of course. Now, if you will come this way, please?

107
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,574
Yes. Thank you.

108
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:56,552
Well, you all heard the position. We don't know what this inflection is and how it got into the base but I want you all to take extra precautions while this emergency is on. We may be short-handed for quite a while.

109
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:57,882
Is this how its goes, Doctor?

110
00:10:58,114 --> 00:11:03,207
Yes, that's right. Then, this unit automatically controls the pulse, the temperature and the breathing.

111
00:11:03,403 --> 00:11:04,761
A sort of electronic Doctor.

112
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:05,810
Yes.

113
00:11:05,892 --> 00:11:07,432
And it even give you medicines too.

114
00:11:07,604 --> 00:11:09,488
Yes. It will do very nearly everything.

115
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:11,267
How do you think he is, Doctor?

116
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,992
Oh, he's not too bad. He's a bit concussed and feverish but he'll be all right with rest.

117
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:20,761
The Piper! The McCrimmon Piper! Don't let him get me!

118
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:21,846
Piper?

119
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:28,934
Some legend of his clan. As far, as I can make out - this piper appears to a McCrimmon just before he dies.

120
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:31,349
Has this phantom piper appeared to Jamie yet?

121
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:32,968
You don't believe it, do you?

122
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:35,354
No, but he does. It's important to him.

123
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,012
He keeps asking us to keep the piper away from him.

124
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:41,356
Good. We can see if we can do just that.

125
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,816
Well, carry on Nurse.

126
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:50,131
Well, at least I try to help. There's a ward full of sick men and no doctor. Somebody got to do something.

127
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:54,155
I wonder who this is?

128
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:57,486
Don't get too near. Have a look on his chart.

129
00:11:57,728 --> 00:11:59,245
That's a good idea.

130
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:00,497
It's Dr. Evans.

131
00:12:00,683 --> 00:12:03,437
Oh, yes. The station doctor. He was the first one to get it.

132
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,204
He looks one of the worst.

133
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:13,750
There's something about this epidemic that I... I just don't understand. It's not like a real disease at all! It's almost like...

134
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:15,580
Not real! What more do you want?

135
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,950
I don't know. But there are certain signs and symptoms which don't add up.

136
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,814
Ben, I want you to go to the control room and keep an eye on things.

137
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:24,693
But how?

138
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:27,210
Give a hand, do anything but keep your eyes and ears open.

139
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:28,094
Right.

140
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:31,687
There's something very wrong here. Something very wrong indeed.

141
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:42,663
Still up, Nobby. Why not take a rest. Go and get some sleep.

142
00:12:42,854 --> 00:12:57,934
Oh, How can I rest with that thing up the spout. You know the score as well as I do. 
Five units off centre and we lift half London into space! Five more and the Atlantic water level goes up three feet! 
Rinberg don't understand the pressure we're under.

143
00:12:58,036 --> 00:13:01,097
Hey you! What do you thinking you are doing?! Skulking here?

144
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:03,290
Just wondering if I can help, sir.

145
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,664
Well, how can you help?

146
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,170
We can do with an extra pair of hands - he can help me.

147
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:11,765
Well, keep him away from me, that's all. All right, I'll go and lie down. Call me if anything happens.

148
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,840
Yes, of course.

149
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:18,751
Oh, by the way, there were two more of those momentary drops in air pressure while I was on. I have put them in the log.

150
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,697
Right.

151
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:22,154
What is that?

152
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:27,429
Shhhh, it's all right Polly. It's only me. We don't want to wake everybody up do we?

153
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:35,740
You look if you can do with some sleep yourself.

154
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,885
I'm all right.

155
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:40,468
What have you got there?

156
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:42,858
Oh, I been doing a little investigation.

157
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:45,029
A piece of silver paper. What is it?

158
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:46,188
I don't know.

159
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:48,314
What's happened?!

160
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:51,551
Oh, it's nothing. It probably just a changeover in the time cycle.

161
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,118
What do you mean?

162
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:59,914
Oh, you see - it's rather interesting really - you see on the moon, they have a fortnight of days and a fortnight of nights.

163
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:00,882
Well?

164
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:08,399
Well, it's oblivious isn't it? They have to make their own day and night artificially up there - or it would upset their own biological time clock.

165
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:09,674
Their what?

166
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:13,476
They won't know if they were coming or going. Get it?

167
00:14:13,737 --> 00:14:14,623
Yes.

168
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:18,425
Clever girl. QED. That's why it's dark up here.

169
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:21,877
Oh, I see what you mean. Yes, of course. How stupid of me.

170
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:25,314
Of course along the control centre it's probably broad daylight.

171
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:28,393
Polly, you wouldn't be making fun of me would you?

172
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:29,657
No.

173
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,972
Dr. Evans.

174
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:48,071
The hand. No, don't touch me. No. The silver hand.

175
00:14:57,809 --> 00:14:59,545
Doctor, is he...

176
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:03,982
Yes, I'm afraid he is.

177
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:14,018
What are we gone to do?

178
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:19,088
What does he means by the silver hand. I better report this to Mr. Hobson.

179
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,405
What's the matter?

180
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:49,529
Something just went out of that door!

181
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:51,017
Nils! John!

182
00:15:51,186 --> 00:15:52,251
What was it?

183
00:15:57,852 --> 00:15:59,830
Nothing. Nothing there.

184
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:10,295
Your nerves are getting the better of you. Where's Evan's body?

185
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:11,521
Over there.

186
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,402
All right, let's get it over with.

187
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:29,679
Is this somebody's idea of a particularly bad joke?

188
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:31,285
This is no joke, believe me!

189
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:37,456
Mr. Hobson, Mr. Hobson, you are wanted! Another man's collapsed at the controls and the Gravitron has been thrown off alignment again.

190
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:38,390
Come on!

191
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,463
And you better find that Doctor's body or out you all go - quarantine or no quarantine.

192
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:55,252
I don't understand what could have happened. I must have dozed off or something but one thing I am sure of - something went out of that door just as you came in.

193
00:16:55,301 --> 00:16:59,180
That body can't just have vanished. Polly, I am going to leave you alone...

194
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,356
...just for a minute.

195
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:01,789
All right.

196
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:05,102
Water. Water.

197
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,133
I'll go and get you some.

198
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:08,461
Water!

199
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:42,126
It's you! The phantom piper!

200
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:38,896
It's you.

201
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,588
The phantom piper!

202
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:43,679
No!

203
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:46,746
No! I'll not go with you!

204
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:49,921
Do you hear me, piper? No! Leave me!

205
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,942
Leave me. I'll not go with you, do you hear me?

206
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,923
Leave me! No, I'll not go with you!

207
00:17:57,096 --> 00:18:00,074
I'll fight you every inch of the way.

208
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:02,241
I'll not go with you.

209
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:11,461
Leave me, piper.

210
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:15,616
No. Leave me. I'll not go.

211
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,164
Agh!

212
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:25,880
- Molly, what's happened?
- Oh, Doctor, it was horrible!

213
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:30,387
- A giant creature like a Cyberman!
- It's all right. Don't be frightened.

214
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:34,737
- Whatever it was, it's gone now.
- It's the... Doctor, the Cyberman was carrying a patient.

215
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:38,362
- Cyberman? What are you talking about?
- I'm sure it was.

216
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:40,417
- I'll not go with you.
- It's OK. It's safe now. Take it easy.

217
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:43,638
She's right.
There's another one gone.

218
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:48,947
Sam, Jules, you've got to find these men.
They can't just disappear in a place this size.

219
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:52,610
Search every square inch, come back until you find them. Now move.

220
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:59,011
Now, supposing you tell me your story?
What did you see?

221
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:02,312
I went out to get Jamie some water,

222
00:19:02,484 --> 00:19:08,600
and when I came back,
I saw this giant man or creature or something,

223
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:13,347
just going out of the door,
carrying one of the patients... like a doll.

224
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:17,170
- I think it was a Cyberman.
- Forget that part. Then what?

225
00:19:18,107 --> 00:19:21,760
Then nothing.
The door shut, and then you came in.

226
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:27,723
- What do you know about all this?
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

227
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:30,055
We'll see about that in a minute.

228
00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:34,326
- This thing you saw. What was it like?
- It was enormous, and silver.

229
00:19:34,494 --> 00:19:37,987
- It had holes in its head for eyes, like a robot.
- A robot?

230
00:19:38,158 --> 00:19:41,410
But the Cybermen were all killed
when Mondas blew up.

231
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:46,894
Stop this Cyberman nonsense! There were Cybermen, every child knows that, but they were destroyed ages ago!

232
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:49,747
- So we all thought.
- That's enough.

233
00:19:49,915 --> 00:19:52,205
Let's have a little calm thinking.

234
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:57,556
For the past two weeks,
a complete unknown disease has appeared in the base.

235
00:19:57,726 --> 00:20:01,986
People drop in their tracks
and develop a black pattern on their skin.

236
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:04,079
Then some of the patients disappear, right?

237
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:10,644
They can't leave the base without wearing spacesuits,
and there are no spacesuits missing. So where are they?

238
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:14,511
- I must say, It does sound a little odd.
- More than a little.

239
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:19,499
I do know one thing - a new disease starts, people disappear, and then you turn up.

240
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,243
- And you think we did it!
- Oh, come on, we haven't done a thing!

241
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:27,274
Perhaps maybe, I don't know who you are,
what you are, or where you came from,

242
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:29,491
but you can get off the moon now!

243
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:32,953
- Well, that suits me fine, the sooner the better!
- No, Ben, we can't go yet.

244
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:38,066
- Why not? They don't want us here.
- Because there is something evil here. We must stay.

245
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:41,529
- Evil? Don't be daft!
- Evil is what I meant.

246
00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:46,882
There are some corners of the universe
which have bred the most terrible things.

247
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,111
Things which act against everything
that we believe in. They must be fought.

248
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:57,872
This disease, for instance. It isn't really
a disease at all, but I can help you with it.

249
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:01,373
You'll see. I'll find the cause for you.

250
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:05,404
- Will you, indeed?
- Yes, certainly. I just need to examine a few things. That's all.

251
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:08,983
- It should be simple.
- Well, I'm not sure.

252
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,864
I'll give you just one Earth-day cycle
to find the cause.

253
00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:15,916
- Earth what?
- 24 hours.

254
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,492
- But that's no time at all.
- It's all you're going to get.

255
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:22,720
Then you get off the moon,
with this bloke here.

256
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:25,896
- You can't move him! He's very ill.
- We accept.

257
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:29,684
Now tell me, you have pathological
equipment here, yes?

258
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,672
Yes. Evans was working on
an extensive research project. It's all in here.

259
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:40,191
It's quite a small unit. We're not equipped
to deal with a full-scale epidemic.

260
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:44,253
- Do you think you can manage?
- Yes.

261
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:49,579
Right. I'll leave you to it.
Don't forget - 24 hours.

262
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,322
- What are you going to do, Doctor?
- We'll start with this one.

263
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:06,079
- Are you really a medical doctor?
- Yes, I think I was once, Polly.

264
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:10,061
I think I took a degree once, in Glasgow.

265
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:15,223
1888, I think. Lister. Hold that for me, will you?

266
00:22:17,643 --> 00:22:21,021
- Oh!
- All right. He's quite unconscious.

267
00:22:50,822 --> 00:22:56,492
It's all right, Jamie. It's all right.
You're going to get better but you must lie still.

268
00:22:56,661 --> 00:23:00,233
What is this place?
Is it the home of the piper?

269
00:23:00,405 --> 00:23:03,783
No, we're on the moon.
You know, the moon up in the sky.

270
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:05,792
No, I can't be alive.

271
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:08,286
I've just seen the piper.

272
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,641
The piper! I knew!

273
00:24:03,257 --> 00:24:05,834
Polly! What's happened?

274
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,788
Polly.

275
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:10,081
Are you all right?

276
00:24:12,944 --> 00:24:15,600
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

277
00:24:15,762 --> 00:24:19,942
- Isn't there any clue at all?
- No. It's a complete blank.

278
00:24:20,111 --> 00:24:25,459
All the tests are negative. As far as I can see,
this whole ridiculous place is sterile.

279
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:31,861
- We'll have to tell Mr Hobson, I suppose.
- I simply don't understand it.

280
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:36,940
Doctor, it couldn't possibly have
anything to do with Lister, could it?

281
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,507
- Lister?
- Well, I mean, you did say

282
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,691
that you took your degree in Glasgow in 1888.

283
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,471
That's an awfully long time from now, 2070, whatever it is.

284
00:24:46,081 --> 00:24:49,814
Are you suggesting that I'm not confident to carry out these tests?

285
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:55,094
No, No, I'm just wondering if there was anything
that Joseph Lister didn't know in 1888

286
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:59,567
- that might help you now.
- Ssh! Somebody's coming!

287
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:04,155
It's Mr Hobson. Out for blood - ours. Look busy! Quick!

288
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,740
That's the third person
to disappear in the past few hours.

289
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,647
- It's completely illogical.
- Do you mind?

290
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:17,238
Would you mind standing away from the door
and allowing it to close? The slides. The dust!

291
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,737
It must be you people.
We've got some straight talking to do, you and I.

292
00:25:25,902 --> 00:25:28,272
- Polly. Another boot.
- Do you hear me?

293
00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:32,091
- This is extraordinary. Look here.
- Excuse me, please.

294
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:36,286
Excuse me. We ARE trying to help you.

295
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:40,677
- Help? Is that what you call it? You can all get off the moon now.
- No, wait a minute. You said...

296
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,808
- I don't care what I said!
- Ah!

297
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:46,305
- Have you found something?
- I think perhaps I have.

298
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:52,265
Yes, I may be onto something,
but I must have some room.

299
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:57,177
How can I work under these conditions?
Now, please, come along. Outside. I'm trying to work in here!

300
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:00,920
- Ben, see that they stay outside.
- Did you mean that?

301
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,256
- What?
- You've found something?

302
00:26:04,112 --> 00:26:06,964
Oh, Polly, I only wish I had.

303
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:34,588
- Coffee? Sugar?
- Hello, Doctor. Thank you.

304
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:40,265
- It's very hot. Doctor, what about you?
- Thank you, Polly.

305
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:45,458
Doctor, as I was saying, you've had
your chance. You come up with absolutely  nothing.

306
00:26:52,188 --> 00:26:53,837
Don't touch him!

307
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,489
Let me look.

308
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:09,661
Charlie and you, Ben,
give us a hand to get him into the medical unit.

309
00:27:09,824 --> 00:27:12,308
Try not to touch his skin.

310
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:33,613
Don't drink that! It's the sugar!

311
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:39,450
That's why the disease doesn't affect everyone.
It's the sugar. Not everyone takes it.

312
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:41,623
Don't touch it.

313
00:27:54,678 --> 00:27:57,083
- What are you doing?
- Just be patient.

314
00:28:09,052 --> 00:28:10,620
Just as I thought.

315
00:28:11,387 --> 00:28:14,319
A large neurotropic virus.

316
00:28:14,488 --> 00:28:17,065
- Like the space plague?
- No.

317
00:28:17,226 --> 00:28:21,004
It's a large infective agent
that only attacks the nerves.

318
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:27,020
That's why these patients got these lines appear on faces and hands.
It follows the course of the nerves under the skin.

319
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:28,657
That's _ it well. But how did it get in here?

320
00:28:28,822 --> 00:28:33,988
It is the Cybermen. I believe
they have deliberately infected the base.

321
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:39,602
My men have searched every square of the base. There's no space to hide a cat, let alone a Cyberman.

322
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:41,418
Anyhow, how did they get in?

323
00:28:42,632 --> 00:28:44,877
- One moment.
- What is it?

324
00:28:48,108 --> 00:28:51,280
- You say you searched all the base?
- Yes. What of it?

325
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,629
- No chance of anyone hiding anywhere?
- None whatever.

326
00:28:56,523 --> 00:28:59,855
Did your men search in here? Did they?

327
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:03,083
- There was'nt people in here, so...
- Did they search in here?

328
00:29:03,247 --> 00:29:07,266
- No.
- There's nowhere in here they could hide.

329
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:41,970
Oh, no!
Back!

330
00:29:42,142 --> 00:29:43,744
Back.

331
00:29:52,231 --> 00:29:56,854
Stand back, stand back from that door.

332
00:29:58,742 --> 00:29:59,901
You're right! It is them!

333
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:10,554
Quick! Get out of it!

334
00:30:10,747 --> 00:30:11,368
No!

335
00:30:18,432 --> 00:30:19,984
Remain still.

336
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:24,662
You devils! You killed him! An unarmed man!

337
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:25,775
Get up.

338
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,823
You are known to us.

339
00:30:33,743 --> 00:30:34,640
And you to me.

340
00:30:36,905 --> 00:30:39,656
Who is in command?

341
00:30:40,147 --> 00:30:41,034
I am.

342
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:43,374
You will be needed.

343
00:30:43,797 --> 00:30:45,364
What have you done with my men?

344
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,007
They will return.

345
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:49,771
They're not dead?!

346
00:30:50,305 --> 00:30:54,689
No. They are not dead. They are altered.

347
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,394
Altered? What have you done to them?

348
00:30:56,475 --> 00:30:58,485
They are now controlled.

349
00:30:59,848 --> 00:31:01,402
If you do anything to my...

350
00:31:01,477 --> 00:31:03,114
You will do nothing.

351
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:07,976
You will now take us to the control centre.

352
00:31:08,237 --> 00:31:10,053
I'll be damned...

353
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:14,054
Through here.

354
00:31:17,452 --> 00:31:25,202
You will remain here. If you leave you will be converted like the others.

355
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:43,658
Survey party, come in, we are not receiving you, over.

356
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:50,785
Can we see the control antenna from here?

357
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,334
No, Roger. It's just around that first block just outside the main port.

358
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,647
So, we have to send somebody outside so get ready...

359
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:57,567
We have to...

360
00:31:57,773 --> 00:31:59,492
Get back! Get back! These things are lethal!

361
00:31:59,772 --> 00:32:02,324
None will move.

362
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:04,402
If you move you will be killed.

363
00:32:05,147 --> 00:32:06,732
What are they?! How did they get in!?

364
00:32:06,964 --> 00:32:11,067
Silence! We are Cybermen! 

365
00:32:11,313 --> 00:32:13,171
But you were all killed!

366
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:23,506
We are going to take over the Gravitron and use it to destroy the surface of the Earth by changing the weather.

367
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,046
But that will kill everybody on the Earth.

368
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,243
Yes.

369
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:32,039
You're supposed to be so advanced. Here you are, taking your revenge like children.

370
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:35,216
Revenge? What is that?

371
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:37,506
A feeling people have...

372
00:32:37,741 --> 00:32:49,468
Feelings? Yes, we know of this weakness of yours. We are fortunate. We do not posses feelings.

373
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:51,557
Then why are you here?

374
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,767
To eliminate all dangers.

375
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:58,348
But you kill every single thing on the Earth!

376
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:02,682
Yes. All dangers will be eliminated.

377
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:06,353
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

378
00:33:07,674 --> 00:33:09,016
You seem to be better.

379
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:10,373
Aye, I feel myself again.

380
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:11,461
Lie back there!

381
00:33:11,694 --> 00:33:12,498
But I'm better!

382
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:15,081
Oh, my head.

383
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:16,583
Well, take it easy, mate.

384
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:19,556
At least, you know it is not your McCrimmon piper.

385
00:33:19,784 --> 00:33:21,973
It had me worried though, I admit that.

386
00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:25,648
Yeah, those Cybermen have got us all worried mate. We see them in action before.

387
00:33:25,987 --> 00:33:28,269
They must have some weakness.

388
00:33:28,395 --> 00:33:31,310
Well, in my day, they used to sprinkle witches with holy water.

389
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:33,237
Fat lot of use that would be on them.

390
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,679
Sprinkle... Holy Water... Ben!

391
00:33:38,869 --> 00:33:40,094
What are the Cybermen covered in?

392
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,804
As far as I know, their suit is a metal of some sort.

393
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:48,935
What about that thing on their chests? You know the part that replaced their heart and lungs.

394
00:33:49,136 --> 00:33:50,286
Some kind of plastic I think.

395
00:33:50,909 --> 00:34:02,005
I thought so. You see, it's simple. Nail vanish remover dissolves nail vanish. Nail vanish is a plastic so we do what Jamie says, we sprinkle them, see?!

396
00:34:02,144 --> 00:34:03,848
No, clear as mud if you ask me.

397
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:05,766
Anyway, I am going to try an experiment.

398
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:08,161
Yes, Professor.

399
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,284
Dr. Evans! I thought he was dead. I thought that they were all dead!

400
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:28,903
Better if they were by the look of it.

401
00:34:39,636 --> 00:34:45,247
Tell the operators in the power unit to come out.

402
00:34:45,578 --> 00:34:46,861
Now.

403
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:59,891
All right, you can all see what is happening. Come on out, leave the machine and don't try anything.

404
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:11,009
They will now take over the Gravitron power unit.

405
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,161
Yes.

406
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:34,016
But you can't send them in their without protected helmets.

407
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:35,203
Why?

408
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:41,170
The machine produces very intense sonic fields. Without the helmets, those men will be insane in a few hours!

409
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:43,225
How many hours?

410
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:44,681
Twelve possibly.

411
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:47,426
Then there is no problem.

412
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:48,276
Why?

413
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:52,074
Our purpose will be achieved before that.

414
00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:54,371
But what about the men?

415
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:58,338
They will be disposed of.

416
00:36:06,136 --> 00:36:08,218
Now, keep your fingers crossed.

417
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:12,258
It's works!

418
00:36:12,522 --> 00:36:14,007
But I still don't know what you are on about.

419
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:18,103
If we can sprinkle some of that on their chest units, it might help to soften them.

420
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,095
I get it! You mwan it will clobber their controls or something.

421
00:36:21,298 --> 00:36:22,173
Yes, that's it.

422
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:33,076
Main power into the vortex generators now.

423
00:36:37,173 --> 00:36:39,457
What is happening?

424
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:41,902
There is loss of control.

425
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:08,799
Now look, we only have one chance at this. When I open the door, drop down as low as you can, aim this things... at their chests and squirt like mad. Right?

426
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:09,603
Right.

427
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:10,456
Get ready.

428
00:37:10,486 --> 00:37:12,688
Someone is there.

429
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,613
Quick, get their chest things!

430
00:37:41,603 --> 00:37:43,298
Quick, get these things off their heads!

431
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:56,039
Come on! Quick, there isn't a moment to lose. We got to get the Gravitron down to safe level.

432
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,287
What about those poor men?

433
00:37:57,496 --> 00:37:59,466
Shift them off to the medical unit, as quick as you can.

434
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:09,524
We are not receiving you. We are not receiving you.

435
00:38:10,517 --> 00:38:13,590
They must have failed.

436
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:20,817
Yes. We must invade now. Prepare the weapons.

437
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:22,352
Yes.

438
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:33,164
Now listen everybody. I don't know how many more of these Cybermen there are, but our point of view we are under siege. I'll reckon they will be back in a bit...

439
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:36,802
Now communications. Charlie, keep trying to get through to Earth. Right?

440
00:38:36,974 --> 00:38:37,608
Right, will do.

441
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:43,322
The rest of you, lower the armoured doors at all exits. Make up as much of that gubbins that you got, we may need it.

442
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:47,389
Mr Hobson, how far can the probe be lowered down?

443
00:38:47,717 --> 00:38:48,717
About thirty degrees.

444
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:49,524
That's no good.

445
00:38:49,677 --> 00:38:50,553
What do you mean?

446
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,435
Can any other part be lowered?

447
00:38:52,777 --> 00:38:56,271
Well, the main coil lenses can be shifted about without too much trouble but too much trouble...

448
00:38:56,565 --> 00:38:57,400
There's something outside there!

449
00:38:57,579 --> 00:38:58,227
What is it?

450
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,212
It's a long way off.

451
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:00,340
I'll come.

1
00:40:39,716 --> 00:40:44,146
- They can't just march in here, can they?
- Not now we've discovered how they got in.

2
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,807
Yes. They tunnelled into the storeroom.

3
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,917
- Doctor, Mr. Hobson, come quickly!
- What is it?

4
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:57,887
<i>MoonbaseI MoonbaseI</i>

5
00:40:58,054 --> 00:41:02,209
<i>- They've got our wavelength. We hear you.
- You are surrounded.</i>

6
00:41:02,372 --> 00:41:05,150
<i>All resistance is useless.</i>

7
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:08,463
<i>You must open the entry port.</i>

8
00:41:08,628 --> 00:41:14,435
Let me. You're wasting your time. We've
discovered your passageway and blocked it.

9
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,789
<i>- You cannot enter now.
- Resistance is useless.</i>

10
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,977
- Can they get in?
- I don't know, but I'm not stopping to find out.

11
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,683
- Get me Earth as quick as you can.
- Right.

12
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,869
Weather Control Moon calling Earth.
Come in.

13
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:37,633
<i>Emergency! Emergency!</i>

14
00:41:37,802 --> 00:41:41,223
<i>There is a spaceship
approaching from Earth.</i>

15
00:41:41,394 --> 00:41:47,122
<i>It will arrive on the lunar surface
in 15 minutes.</i>

16
00:41:47,286 --> 00:41:51,603
<i>Immediate offensive action must be taken.</i>

17
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:55,541
<i>They have blocked up our way into the base.</i>

18
00:41:55,714 --> 00:42:00,065
<i>Other methods to gain entry will be tried.</i>

19
00:42:01,326 --> 00:42:05,068
<i>The machine from Earth
must first be destroyed.</i>

20
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:08,466
<i>There are 14 minutes left.</i>

21
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:10,399
<i>Understood.</i>

22
00:42:20,093 --> 00:42:23,720
<i>Transmit control signal.</i>

23
00:43:34,954 --> 00:43:41,112
<i>You will listen to me
and follow my instructions.</i>

24
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:43,901
Here we are. I've brought some coffee to keep us awake.

25
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:47,008
- Without sugar this time, I hope?
- Of course. Don't remind me.

26
00:43:47,177 --> 00:43:50,241
- Take some to the Doctor. He's in the Dome.
- Right.

27
00:44:17,082 --> 00:44:23,854
<i>You will now change
field co-ordinates as instructed.</i>

28
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:31,003
Doctor, they've spotted it
on the scanner - the relief ship.

29
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,094
- Ben, where?
- Over here.
- Let's see.

30
00:44:33,264 --> 00:44:36,570
- Well?
- No doubt about it. I told you they would be on their way!

31
00:44:36,762 --> 00:44:38,208
It's not far off.

32
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:41,636
Far off? It's coming in now off parking orbit. It will be down in six minutes.

33
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:45,308
- Don't think you ought to warn them?
- Yes, the Cybermen will be waiting for them.

34
00:44:45,479 --> 00:44:48,658
Don't worry. They've got their own warning system and weapons.

35
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:54,235
They'll blast the Cybermen and their spaceship
to kingdom come four minutes from now.

36
00:44:56,255 --> 00:44:58,263
Come on!

37
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:01,097
It seems to move so slowly.

38
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:10,258
- What are they doing?
- Looks like they've changed direction.

39
00:45:11,147 --> 00:45:14,372
They've changed into an escape orbit.
Follow it.

40
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:17,762
- It's going too fast. I can't keep up with it.
- Keep trying.

41
00:45:17,927 --> 00:45:23,252
- I can't hold it. It's accelerating too fast.
- Look out man. You're on the sun.

42
00:45:23,414 --> 00:45:27,041
- That's where it's heading.
- The acceleration's gigantic!

43
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:32,568
- Get R/T contact with the ship.
- It's no good, sir...the
doppler effect...It's going too fast.

44
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:36,842
They've had it, I'm afraid.

45
00:45:37,015 --> 00:45:39,391
- The sun...
- Yes.

46
00:45:39,557 --> 00:45:42,576
Will somebody please tell us
what it all means?

47
00:45:42,746 --> 00:45:47,222
The rocket has been deflected
towards the sun. Nothing can save them now.

48
00:45:47,387 --> 00:45:51,048
- Save them? What do you mean?
- From plunging into the sun.

49
00:45:51,221 --> 00:45:53,516
But the sun's millions of miles away.

50
00:45:53,683 --> 00:45:58,113
Once they get into the sun's gravity belt,
they can't change course.

51
00:45:58,283 --> 00:46:01,509
It may take a week but they'll end up there.

52
00:46:01,673 --> 00:46:04,899
What on earth could have caused it?

53
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:08,530
The rocket was deflected off course,
but why, and how?

54
00:46:08,696 --> 00:46:10,704
Deflected?

55
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:15,905
- Yes, of course. The Gravitron!
- Have the Cybermen got a gravity weapon, do you think?

56
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:17,851
- No, they haven't, but we have.
- You're not suggesting...?

57
00:46:18,017 --> 00:46:22,447
The only one way that rocket could be deflected into the sun
was from this very room.

58
00:46:22,618 --> 00:46:24,224
I see what you mean.

59
00:46:24,394 --> 00:46:26,529
Of course - the Gravitron.

60
00:46:26,694 --> 00:46:30,614
- Benson! He must...
- I said he'd been on duty too long.

61
00:46:30,986 --> 00:46:32,696
If it IS Benson...

62
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,819
It's Evans!

63
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:51,356
- He was in the medical room.
- The Cybermen have control of them again.

64
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,737
- And the other men in there?
- They may not be affected yet.

65
00:46:54,904 --> 00:46:59,496
- Get down to the medical room. Barricade the door with everything
you can find. Keep them in there at all costs!
- Right.

66
00:47:21,392 --> 00:47:23,848
What is he doing in there?

67
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:30,105
Look at the field reactors. We must get back control soon. 
He could flood half of Europe

68
00:47:30,271 --> 00:47:33,576
if he keeps the Gravitron
aligned with spring tides.

69
00:47:33,741 --> 00:47:36,679
That settles it. We'll have to rush him.
Get those weapons out.

70
00:47:42,338 --> 00:47:45,356
<i>Resistance is useless.</i>

71
00:47:45,526 --> 00:47:49,072
<i>All further ships from Earth will be deflected.</i>

72
00:47:49,638 --> 00:47:52,048
<i>Open the air lock to us.</i>

73
00:47:52,221 --> 00:47:55,687
<i>If you do not, we shall destroy the base,</i>

74
00:47:55,853 --> 00:47:58,343
<i>and you will be eliminated.</i>

75
00:47:58,516 --> 00:48:00,043
Can you hear me?

76
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:05,284
<i>Everything you have said
in the past half-hour has been overheard.</i>

77
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:10,624
You can hear this, too, then. We're not done
yet, and we'll fight you to the last man.

78
00:48:10,785 --> 00:48:14,894
<i>- You'll never get inside this base!
- We are in it already.</i>

79
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:20,308
They've punctured the dome!

80
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:24,098
The oxygen masks.
Everyone take a mask over there!

81
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:35,839
I hope that we don't lose too much oxygen.

82
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:39,073
- Can we patch it, do you think?
- We can try.

83
00:48:39,237 --> 00:48:41,246
Give me a hand off with this.

84
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:45,044
Doctor, I can't breathe.

85
00:48:49,447 --> 00:48:52,190
Thank heavens! I can breathe again.

86
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,428
Oh, no!

87
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,744
- What can we patch it with?
- Nothing.

88
00:49:00,908 --> 00:49:02,642
Wait...

89
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:04,458
Over there.

90
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,053
Slide it to me but don't let go of it.

91
00:49:11,401 --> 00:49:14,510
We have to do it in one action. No second chance. Are you ready?

92
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,403
Now!

93
00:49:23,751 --> 00:49:26,000
Stopped them for the moment.

94
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:29,994
- I wonder for how long.
- Let's have a look.

95
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:41,424
Polly! Are you all right?

96
00:49:42,436 --> 00:49:44,089
Yes.

97
00:49:45,786 --> 00:49:49,331
- Where's that air coming from?
- Reserve tanks of oxygen.

98
00:49:49,498 --> 00:49:53,733
- Why couldn't we have had those before?
- And lose all our oxygen?

99
00:49:53,897 --> 00:49:55,905
I see.

100
00:50:01,403 --> 00:50:04,708
- It's so quiet!
- Yes, it is, isn't it?

101
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:07,410
The Gravitron's stopped!

102
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:12,693
Quick. Before he comes to. Ben! Jamie!

103
00:50:13,874 --> 00:50:15,446
Joe!

104
00:50:15,609 --> 00:50:19,636
We've barricaded the sick bay with half the chairs and tables in the base, but it won’t
hold them for ever.

105
00:50:19,703 --> 00:50:22,628
Well done.
Here's another one for you.

106
00:50:22,793 --> 00:50:25,731
- What do we do with him, Doctor?
- That's your problem.

107
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,794
Just make sure he doesn’t come
back here for a while.

108
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:31,425
I’ll be after a job as a copper when I get
back to 1966!

109
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:36,828
Mr Hobson, I've got an idea.

110
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:41,184
- Doctor, what do you make of this?
- Made by a laser beam, I think.

111
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:46,429
- Is there anything the Cybermen haven't got?
- They haven’t got a Gravitron. Or they wouldn't be after yours.

112
00:50:46,497 --> 00:50:49,516
We'll have to stand guard here
with their cyberguns.

113
00:50:49,685 --> 00:50:54,564
Not much use. They're getting
reinforcements. Looks like another spaceship.

114
00:50:55,376 --> 00:50:57,304
Just there.

115
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:58,792
Another one!

116
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,250
<i>We have brought
reinforcements with other weapons.</i>

117
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,897
<i>You have one chance.
You must open the entry port.</i>

118
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:19,984
<i>You cannot stop us now.
You will all be completely destroyed.</i>

119
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:25,321
- What does he mean, other weapons?
- We'll soon find out. You stay here. I must report this to Mr. Hobson.

120
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,504
<i>I shall count to ten.</i>

121
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:39,403
<i>If you still stupidly remain silent,
we shall fire.</i>

122
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:41,737
<i>One...</i>

123
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:47,839
- Hurry! They've got another weapon. They're going to ...
- Yes, I know. There it is.

124
00:51:48,001 --> 00:51:51,869
Everybody take cover.
Get down, all of you! Doctor!

125
00:51:52,037 --> 00:51:54,099
- Is the Gravitron still switched on?
- Yes.

126
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:55,854
Then I shall certainly stay here.

127
00:51:56,864 --> 00:52:01,456
<i>.. nine, ten... FireI</i>

128
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,079
<i>Again. Fire.</i>

129
00:52:22,612 --> 00:52:26,354
- What happened?
- It just deflected over the dome.

130
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:28,260
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

131
00:52:28,424 --> 00:52:33,624
- The Gravitron deflected it. The force field.
- Yes. And that gives me an idea.

132
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:36,454
What are they doing now?

133
00:52:41,337 --> 00:52:43,231
They're packing it away.

134
00:52:43,395 --> 00:52:46,414
What will they cook up next?

135
00:52:49,893 --> 00:52:55,862
How far down can this be aimed? Can it be
brought to bear on the surface of the moon?

136
00:52:56,027 --> 00:52:58,483
- I see!
- Well...

137
00:52:58,651 --> 00:53:01,509
- Has it ever been tried?
- No, but we shall try.

138
00:53:01,677 --> 00:53:05,625
- With Evans gone, the Gravitron is all yours.
- Je m'en occupe!

139
00:53:05,794 --> 00:53:09,054
Any further down,
and the field may affect the base.

140
00:53:09,224 --> 00:53:11,887
- What does that matter now?
- Ah, I suppose you're right.

141
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:16,560
- Get someone to stand by that window
and relay instructions direct to Benoit.
- Right!

142
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:30,121
- He's ready.
- Start moving the probe down.

143
00:54:24,813 --> 00:54:27,912
- That's as far as it will go.
- What?

144
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:30,217
But it's way over their heads.

145
00:54:30,382 --> 00:54:33,963
There's one chance.
We'll try bringing it down by hand.

146
00:54:34,136 --> 00:54:37,154
- Is this still switched off?
- No, No.. Yes, of course.

147
00:54:43,054 --> 00:54:46,440
- It won't go.
- All your weight. Once more.

148
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:52,567
- It's no use. It won't shift.
- Ah, stupid of me! Of course it won't!

149
00:54:52,636 --> 00:54:54,872
- Why?
- The angular cut-out. It's obvious!

150
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,168
There's got to be a safety cut-out
on the angle of the probe.

151
00:55:01,336 --> 00:55:07,258
Otherwise, it might affect the whole base.
That's done it. Stand back. Benoit can do it now.

152
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,082
Switch on!

153
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:48,506
Well, that's taken care of the Cybermen!

154
00:55:48,674 --> 00:55:54,034
We've got to get this Gravitron
in operation as fast as we can!

155
00:55:54,203 --> 00:55:57,026
- I'm so sorry we damaged it.
- What? Oh, yes...

156
00:55:58,279 --> 00:56:02,193
Nils, rig up a temporary aerial.
Call up Space Control.

157
00:56:02,355 --> 00:56:07,761
Tell Rinberg we'll be operational
in about two hours. It's the best we can do.

158
00:56:07,924 --> 00:56:13,125
We've only two hours to get
the world's weather under control again.

159
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:17,160
Benoit, take charge of your side.
And, Doctor... What the...

160
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:22,767
It's just as well.
We've enough madmen here already!

161
00:56:22,937 --> 00:56:26,518
I want to see
your first weather plot in two minutes!

162
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:28,022
Come on, boys.

163
00:56:50,057 --> 00:56:51,388
Doctor, look.

164
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:56,099
Could that be them?
Possibly.

165
00:56:56,272 --> 00:56:59,210
And I hope it's the last we see of them.

169
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:33,160
- Let's have a look at the Time Scanner.
- The what?

170
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:38,496
The Time Scanner. Instead of showing where
we are, it gives you a glimpse of the future.

171
00:57:38,657 --> 00:57:41,802
The second sight? Very dangerous.

172
00:57:41,966 --> 00:57:46,719
Nonsense! I haven't used it very much.
It's not very reliable, as you can see.

173
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,302
Doctor...

174
00:57:48,464 --> 00:57:50,277
Look!

175
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,500
Next: The Macra Terror
