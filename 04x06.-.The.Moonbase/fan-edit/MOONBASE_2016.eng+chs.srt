00:11:58,494 --> 00:11:59,555
I wonder who this is?
咦，这是谁？

138
00:11:59,815 --> 00:12:02,886
Don't get too near. Have a look on his chart.
别太近了，看看他的记录

139
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:04,645
That's a good idea.
这是个好注意

140
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:05,897
It's Dr. Evans.

He looks one of the worst.

143
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,150
There's something about this epidemic
that I... I just don't understand. 
对于这个流行病，有一些是我...不能理解的

144
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:19,150
It's not like a real disease at all! It's almost like...
看着就不像一种真正的疾病，完全像是...

145
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:20,980
Not real! What more do you want?
不是真正的！你还想要多真？

146
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:25,350
I don't know. But there are certain signs and symptoms
which don't add up.
我不知道，但这里有一些体征和症状相互矛盾

147
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,214
Ben, I want you to go to the control room and keep an eye on things.
Ben，我要你到控制室去，盯着点

148
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,093
But how?
怎么盯？

149
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:32,610
Give a hand, do anything but keep your eyes and ears open.
帮帮忙什么的，做什么都行，不过眼睛要放亮点

150
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:33,494

There's something very wrong here. Something very wrong indeed.
这里有些事情非常不对劲，真的非常不对劲

152
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:48,063
Still up, Nobby. Why not take a rest. Go and get some sleep.
还没睡啊，Nobby, 为什么不休息一下，去睡一下吧

153
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:53,334
Oh, How can I rest with that thing up the spout.
You know the score as well as I do.
噢，有了这事儿我这么还能睡得着啊，你跟我一样清楚现在的状态

154
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:56,834
Five units off centre and we lift half London into space!
偏离中心五个单位，半个伦敦就被抬到空中了

155
00:12:56,954 --> 00:12:59,934
Five more and the Atlantic water level goes up three feet! 
再偏五个单位，大西洋的水平面就得上升三尺！

Rinberg don't understand the pressure we're under.
Rinerg 并不理解我们当前的压力

157
00:13:03,436 --> 00:13:06,497
Hey you! What do you thinking you are doing?! Skulking here?
嘿你！你在干什么呢！在这里躲懒吗?

158
00:13:06,692 --> 00:13:08,690
Just wondering if I can help, sir.
只是看看有什么能帮上忙的，先生

159

Well, how can you help?
哦，你能帮什么忙？

160
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,570
We can do with an extra pair of hands - he can help me.
我们这边需要多几个人手 - 他可以来帮我

161
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:14,665
Well, keep him away from me, that's all.
行，别让他在我这里晃悠就行了．

162
00:13:14,763 --> 00:13:17,165
All right, I'll go and lie down. Call me if anything happens.
好了，我走了，去躺躺．如果有任何事就叫我

163
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,240
Yes, of course.
好的，没问题

164
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:23,251
Oh, by the way, there were two more of those momentary drops
in air pressure while I was on.
哦，顺便说一下，我在这里的时候又出现过两次短暂的气压下降

165
00:13:23,347 --> 00:13:24,151
I have put them in the log.
我都记在日志里面了

What is that?
那是什么？

168
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:32,829
Shhhh, it's all right Polly. It's only me.
We don't want to wake everybody up do we?
嘘，没事的 Polly．就我一个．我们不想吵醒每一个人吧

169
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:41,140
You look if you can do with some sleep yourself.

Oh, I been doing a little investigation.
哦，我做了一点调查

173
00:13:48,874 --> 00:13:50,929
A piece of silver paper. What is it?

I don't know.

00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:53,714
What's happened?!
什么情况？

176
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:56,951
Oh, it's nothing. It probably just a changeover in the time cycle.
哦，没事．只是人工昼夜交替而已

177
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,518
What do you mean?
什么意思？

178
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:01,314
Oh, you see - it's rather interesting really
哦，你看，这真的很有意思

179
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:05,314
you see on the moon, they have a fortnight of days
and a fortnight of nights.
你看看月球，他们有长达１４天的白天和１４天的黑夜

180
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:06,282
Well?
是吗？

181
00:14:06,653 --> 00:14:11,099
Well, it's oblivious isn't it? They have to
make their own day and night artificially up there
是啊，这很明显啊是不？他们这里就不得不靠人工制造白天和黑夜

182
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:13,799
Or it would upset their own biological time clock.
否则他们的生物钟就会紊乱

183
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:15,074
Their what?
他们的什么？

184
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,876
They won't know if they were coming or going. Get it?
他们就不知道该起床还是睡觉了，明白了吗？

185
00:14:19,137 --> 00:14:20,023
Yes.
哦

186
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:23,825
Clever girl. QED. That's why it's dark up here.
聪明. 证明完毕．这就是为什么现在这里黑了

187
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:27,277
Oh, I see what you mean. Yes, of course. How stupid of me.
哦，我明白你什么意思了．对了，当然．我真是太蠢了

188
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:30,714
Of course along the control centre it's probably broad daylight.
当然了在控制中心那边可能一直都是白天

189
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,793
Polly, you wouldn't be making fun of me would you?
Polly, 你不是在逗我吧，是吗？

190
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:35,057
No.
不！

00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,372
Dr. Evans.

194
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:09,382
Yes, I'm afraid he is.

00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:19,418
What are we gone to do?
那我们该做什么？

196
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:24,488
What does he means by the silver hand.
I better report this to Mr. Hobson.
他说＂银色的手＂是什么意思？我最好向 Hobson 先生报告一下

197
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:48,205
What's the matter?
什么情况？

198
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:50,329
Something just went out of that door!
什么东西从那个门跑出去了！

199
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:51,817
Nils! John!

200

What was it?
是什么东西？

201
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:00,630
Nothing. Nothing there.

Your nerves are getting the better of you. Where's Evan's body?

203
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:11,521
Over there.
在那边

204
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,402
All right, let's get it over with.
好了，让我们结束吧

205
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:29,679
Is this somebody's idea of a particularly bad joke?
这是谁开的恶意玩笑吗？

206
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:31,285
This is no joke, believe me!
这不是玩笑，相信我！

207
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:33,456
Mr. Hobson, Mr. Hobson, you are wanted!
Hobson 先生，Hobson 先生，这里需要你

And you better find that Doctor's body or out you all go
- quarantine or no quarantine.
你们最好找到医生的尸体，否则你们都得出去 - 不管隔离不隔离

211
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:50,552
I don't understand what could have happened.
I must have dozed off or something
我不清楚刚才可能发生了什么，我肯定是打盹了

212
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:55,252
but one thing I am sure of
- something went out of that door just as you came in.
但有一件事我可以肯定：你进来的时候有什么东西跑出那个门去了

213
00:16:55,301 --> 00:16:59,180
That body can't just have vanished.
Polly, I am going to leave you alone...

No! I'll not go with you!

- 一个赛博人一样的大家伙  - 没事了，别怕

233

Sam, Jules, you've got to find these men.
They can't just disappear in a place this size.
Sam, Jules, 你们去找这几个人．他们不可能消失了，就这么点大个地方

until you find them. Now move.
每一寸都要搜到，找不到他们就不要回来．快去

I went out to get Jamie some water,

它正走出门去，扛着一个我们的病人...像个玩偶一样

- Forget that part. Then what?
- 我觉得那是个赛博人  - 忘了那个吧．然后呢？

Then nothing. The door shut, and then you came in.
然后没什么了．门关上了，然后你们进来了

Stop this Cyberman nonsense!
别胡说赛博人那些东西了

There were Cybermen, every child knows that,
but they were destroyed ages ago!
以前是有赛博人，每个小孩子都知道．但他们几十年前就被消灭了！
<i>（注:  赛博人初次出现于1986年，试图夺取地球，后与母星
Mondas 一起毁灭．参见04x01 第十行星 The Tenth Planet）</i>

252
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:49,747
- So we all thought.
- That's enough.
- 我们都这么想  - 别再说了

253
00:19:49,915 --> 00:19:52,205
Let's have a little calm thinking.

254
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:57,556
For the past two weeks,
a complete unknown disease has appeared in the base.
过去两个星期以来，一种完全未知的疾病出现在这个基地

255
00:19:57,726 --> 00:20:01,986
People drop in their tracks
and develop a black pattern on their skin.
人在工作岗位上倒下，皮肤上长出黑色的条纹

256
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:04,079
Then some of the patients disappear, right?

257
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:10,644
They can't leave the base without wearing spacesuits,
and there are no spacesuits missing. So where are they?
不穿太空服的花他们不可能离开基地，但又没有太空服丢失．那他们在哪儿？

258
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:14,511
- I must say, It does sound a little odd.
- More than a little.
- 我得说，这事听着是有一点点奇怪  - 不是一点点

259
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:19,499
I do know one thing - a new disease starts,
people disappear, and then you turn up.
我倒的确知道一件事情 - 新疾病出现，人们消失，然后你们出现了

260
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,243

- Oh, come on, we haven't done a thing!
- 那你就觉得是我们干的？  - 哦，得了，我们什么也没干！

Perhaps maybe, I don't know who you are,
what you are, or where you came from,
也许吧，我也不知道你们是谁，是干什么的，从哪里来

262
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:29,491
but you can get off the moon now!
但你们现在就可以离开月球了！

263
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:32,953
- Well, that suits me fine, the sooner the better!
- No, Ben, we can't go yet.
- 好啊，正想走呢，越早越好！  - 不，Ben, 我们还不能走

264
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:38,066
- Why not? They don't want us here.
- Because there is something evil here. We must stay.
- 为什么不？他们不想让我们在这里 - 因为这里有邪恶的东西，我们必须留下来

265
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:41,529

- Evil is what I meant.
- 邪恶？ 别犯傻了！   - 邪恶．我说的就是这个

00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:46,882
There are some corners of the universe
which have bred the most terrible things.
宇宙中有些角落会孕育出最可怕的东西

267
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,111
Things which act against everything
that we believe in. They must be fought.
这些东西会跟我们所信仰的一切作对．我们必须跟他们斗争

举例来说，这个疾病，其实并不是一种病．但我可以帮助你们

- Well, I'm not sure.
- 那很简单  - 嗯，我不太确定

Then you get off the moon, with this bloke here.
然后你们就离开月球，带着这个家伙

It's all in here.
有．Evans 之前在做一个扩展研究项目．东西都在这里

to deal with a full-scale epidemic.
是一套小型设备，我们并没有针对大规模传染病的配置

You're going to get better but you must lie still.
没事的，Jamie, 没事．你会好起来的，但你必须要躺好

What is this place? Is it the home of the piper?
这是什么地方？这是风笛手的家吗？

- No. It's a complete blank.
- 一点线索也没有吗？  - 没有，完全的空白

所有测试结果都是阴性的．就我所看到的来说，这整个破地方都是无菌的

We'll have to tell Mr Hobson, I suppose.

I don't like it very much. I simply don't understand it.

Doctor, it couldn't possibly have
anything to do with Lister, could it?
博士，这会不会跟李斯特有关，可能吗？

你1888年在格拉斯哥拿到了学位

那可是一段好长的时间了，现在是2070年了

I'm not confident to carry out these tests?
Polly, 你是不是想说我并没有能力进行这些检测？

that Joseph Lister didn't know in 1888
不，不，我只是在想会不会有些什么东西是约瑟夫-李斯特在1888年不知道的

你别站在门边可以吗，让门可以关上？检测片. 灰尘！

The rocket has been deflected towards the sun.
Nothing can save them now.
火箭已经飞偏了，在往太阳飞去．现在没谁能救他们了

535
00:45:47,387 --> 00:45:51,048
- Save them? What are you talking about?
- From plunging into the sun.
- 救他们？你在说什么啊？  - 阻止他们飞向太阳

536
00:45:51,221 --> 00:45:53,516
But the sun's millions of miles away.
但太阳有数百万英里之远呢

537
00:45:53,683 --> 00:45:58,113
Once they get into the sun's gravity belt,
they can't change course.
一旦他们进入了太阳的引力范围，他们就改变不了航线了

538
00:45:58,283 --> 00:46:01,509
It may take a week but they'll end up there.
大概需要一个星期，但他们最终会在那儿

539
00:46:01,673 --> 00:46:04,899
What on earth could have caused it?
到底是什么东西导致了这个？

540
00:46:05,063 --> 00:46:08,530
The rocket was deflected off course, but why, and how?
火箭当然是被导偏了，但是为什么，怎么搞得？

541
00:46:08,696 --> 00:46:10,704
Deflected?
导偏？

542
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:15,905
- Yes, of course. The Gravitron!
- Have the Cybermen got a gravity weapon, do you think?
- 是了，当然，引力创！  - 赛博人有引力武器吗，你觉得？

543
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:17,851
- No, they haven't, but we have.
- You're not suggesting...?
- 不，他们没有，但我们有  - 你不是想说...？

544
00:46:18,017 --> 00:46:23,547
The only one way that rocket could be deflected
into the sun... was this very room.
火箭飞被导向太阳的唯一方法...就在这个房间里！

545
00:46:23,618 --> 00:46:24,324
I see what you mean.
我知道你的意思了

546
00:46:24,394 --> 00:46:26,529
Of course - the Gravitron.
当然了 - 引力创

547
00:46:26,694 --> 00:46:31,114
- Benson! He must...
- I said he'd been on duty too long.
- Benson! 他肯定... - 我说过他值班时间太长了

548
00:46:31,286 --> 00:46:32,696
If it IS Benson...
如果的确是 Benson...

549
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,819
It's Evans!
是 Evans!

550
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:51,356
- He was in the medical room.
- The Cybermen have control of them again.
- 他在医务室啊 - 赛博人又控制了他们

551
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,737
- And the other men in there?
- They may not be affected yet.
- 那里的其他人呢？  - 他们可能还未受影响

552
00:46:54,904 --> 00:46:57,996
Get down to the medical room.
Barricade the door with everything you can find.
赶紧去医务室，用所有能找到的东西把门堵上

553
00:46:58,004 --> 00:46:59,496
- Keep them in there at all costs!  - Right.
- 不惜一切代价把他们控制在里面  - 好

554
00:47:21,392 --> 00:47:23,848
What is he doing in there?
他在那里面做什么？

555
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:29,705
Look at the field reactors. We must get back control soon. 
看看域反应器(?)，我们必须赶紧夺回控制权

556
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:33,576
He could flood half of Europe
if he keeps the Gravitron aligned with spring tides.
他可能都淹了半个欧洲了，如果他一直让引力创定在涨潮位置的话

557
00:47:33,741 --> 00:47:36,679
That settles it. We'll have to rush him.
Get those weapons out.
就这样定了，我们得赶紧把他赶出去．把那些武器拿出来

558
00:47:42,338 --> 00:47:45,356
<i>Resistance is useless.</i>
抵抗是没有用的

559
00:47:45,526 --> 00:47:49,872
<i>All further ships from Earth will be deflected.</i>
后面再有从地球来的飞船也会转向

560
00:47:49,938 --> 00:47:52,048
<i>Open the air lock to us.</i>
为我们打开气闸

561
00:47:52,221 --> 00:47:55,687
<i>If you do not, we shall destroy the base,</i>
如果你们不打开，我们将摧毁基地

562
00:47:55,853 --> 00:47:58,343
<i>and you will be eliminated.</i>
你们将会被消灭

563
00:47:58,516 --> 00:48:00,043
Can you hear me?
你们能听到我？

564
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:05,284
<i>Everything you have said
in the past half-hour has been overheard.</i>
你们在过去半小时内说的话，全都听见了

565
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:10,624
You can hear this, too, then: we're not done yet, 
and we'll fight you to the last man.
你还能听到这个：咱们没完，我们会跟你们战斗到最后一个人

566
00:48:10,785 --> 00:48:14,894
<i>- You'll never get inside this base!
- We are in it already.</i>
- 你们永远进不了这个基地  - 我们已经进来了

567
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:20,308
They've punctured the dome!
他们打穿了穹顶！

568
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:24,098
The oxygen masks.
Everyone take a mask over there!
氧气面罩！所有人都那儿去带上氧气面罩！

569
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:35,839
I hope that we don't lose too much oxygen.
我期望我们没丧失多少氧气

570
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:39,073
- Can we patch it, do you think?
- We can try.
- 我们能补上吧，你说呢  - 我们试试

571
00:48:39,237 --> 00:48:41,246
Give me a hand off with this.
给我搭把手

572
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:45,044
Doctor, I can't breathe.
博士，我不能呼吸了

573
00:48:49,447 --> 00:48:52,190
Thank heavens! I can breathe again.
感谢上天！我又能呼吸了

574
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,428
Oh, no!
噢，不！

575
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,744
- What can we patch it with?
- Nothing.
- 我们能拿什么来堵？  - 没啥

576
00:49:00,908 --> 00:49:02,642
Wait...
等等...

577
00:49:02,805 --> 00:49:04,458
Over there.
那边

578
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,053
Slide it to me but don't let go of it.
把它滑给我，别放手

579
00:49:11,401 --> 00:49:14,910
We have to do it in one action. No second chance. Are you ready?
我们必须一次搞定，没有第二次机会．准备好了吗？

580
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,403
Now!
走！

581
00:49:23,751 --> 00:49:26,000
Stopped them for the moment.
暂时阻止他们了

582
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:29,994
- I wonder for how long.
- Let's have a look.
- 我在想能有多久 - 我们看看吧

583
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:41,424
Polly! Are you all right?
Polly！你没事吧？

584
00:49:42,436 --> 00:49:44,089
Yes.
是的

585
00:49:45,786 --> 00:49:49,331
- Where's that air coming from?
- Reserve tanks of oxygen.
- 那些空气哪里来的？ - 预备的氧气瓶

586
00:49:49,498 --> 00:49:53,733
- Why couldn't we have had those before?
- And lose all our oxygen?
- 之前为什么没有？ - 你是说失去我们所有的氧气？

587
00:49:53,897 --> 00:49:55,905
I see.
我明白了

588
00:50:01,403 --> 00:50:04,708
- It's so quiet!  - Yes, it is, isn't it?
- 好安静啊！  - 是的，真安静，是吧？

589
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:07,410
The Gravitron's stopped!
引力创停掉了！

590
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:12,693
Quick. Before he comes to. Ben! Jamie!
快！在他醒过来之前. Ben! Jamie!

591
00:50:13,874 --> 00:50:15,446
Joe!

592
00:50:15,609 --> 00:50:19,636
We've barricaded the sick bay with half the chairs and tables in the base, but it won’t hold them for ever.
我们堵住了医务室，用了基地半数的椅子和桌子，但没法永远挡住他们

593
00:50:19,703 --> 00:50:22,628
- Well done. - Here's another one for you.
- 干得好  - 这个你来

594
00:50:22,793 --> 00:50:25,731
- What do we do with him, Doctor?
- That's your problem.
- 我们拿他怎么办，博士  - 那是你的事

595
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,794
Just make sure he doesn’t come back here for a while.
只是要确保短时间内他不能回到这里来

596
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:31,425
I’ll be after a job as a copper when I get
back to 1966!
等我回到1966年，我要去找个当警察的职业干干

597
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:36,828
Mr Hobson, I've got an idea.
Hobson 先生，我有了个想法

598
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:41,184
- Doctor, what do you make of this?
- Made by a laser beam, I think.
- 博士，你觉得这是怎么造成的  - 激光束，我想是

599
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:46,429
- Is there anything known to science the Cybermen haven't got?
- They haven’t got a Gravitron. Or they wouldn't be after yours.
科学上已知的东西里面有没有什么赛博人没掌握的？
他们还没有引力创，否则他们不会来抢你们的

600
00:50:46,497 --> 00:50:49,516
We'll have to stand guard here
with their cyberguns.

601
00:50:49,685 --> 00:50:54,564
Not much use. They're getting
reinforcements. Looks like another spaceship.
没多大用. 他们有了增援. 看样子是又来一艘飞船

602
00:50:55,376 --> 00:50:57,304
Just there.
就在那儿

603
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:58,792
Another one!
又来一个！

604
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,250
<i>We have brought
reinforcements with other weapons.</i>
我们带来了增援和其它武器

605
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,897
<i>You have one chance.
You must open the entry port.</i>
你们有一次机会. 你们必须打开入口

606
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:19,984
<i>You cannot stop us now.
You will all be completely destroyed.</i>
现在你们阻挡不了我们了. 你们全部都会被完全消灭

607
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:25,321
- What does he mean, other weapons?
- We'll soon find out. You stay here. I must report this to Mr. Hobson.
他什么意思，“其它武器”？
我们很快就能弄清楚. 你在这里待着. 我必须向 Hobson 先生报告这个

608
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,504
<i>I shall count to ten.</i>
我将数到十

609
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:39,403
<i>If you still stupidly remain silent, we shall fire.</i>
如果你们仍然愚蠢地保持沉默，我们将开火

610
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:41,737
<i>One...</i>
一

611
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:47,839
- Hurry! They've got another weapon. They're going to ...
- Yes, I know. There it is.
- 快！他们有了另外一个武器，他们要...
- 是的，我知道，就在那儿

612
00:51:48,001 --> 00:51:51,869
Everybody take cover. Get down, all of you! Doctor!
所有人都躲起来. 你们全都蹲下！博士！

613
00:51:52,037 --> 00:51:54,099
- Is the Gravitron still switched on?  - Yes.
- 引力创还开着吗？  - 是的

614
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:55,854
Then I shall certainly stay here.
那我就一定还得留在这里

615
00:51:56,864 --> 00:52:01,456
<i>.. nine, ten... Fire!</i>
...九，十...开火！

616
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,079
<i>Again. Fire.</i>
再来，开火！

617
00:52:22,612 --> 00:52:26,354
- What happened?
- It just deflected over the dome.
- 什么情况？ - 它刚才转弯从穹顶上飞过去了

618
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:28,260
- Are you all right?  - Yes.
- 你没事吧？  - 没事

619
00:52:28,424 --> 00:52:33,624
- The Gravitron deflected it. The force field.
- Yes. And that gives me an idea.
- 引力创弹歪了它，力场的作用  - 是的，这给了我一个主意

620
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:36,454
What are they doing now?
他们现在在干什么？

621
00:52:41,337 --> 00:52:43,231
They're packing it away.
他们在收拾走人

622
00:52:43,395 --> 00:52:46,414
What will they cook up next?
他们下一步想炮制什么？

623
00:52:49,893 --> 00:52:55,862
How far down can this be aimed? Can it be
brought to bear on the surface of the moon?
这个最低可以瞄准哪里？能否牵引到对准月球表面？

624
00:52:56,027 --> 00:52:58,483
- I see!  - Well...
- 我明白了  - 这个...

625
00:52:58,651 --> 00:53:01,509
- Has it ever been tried?  - No, but we shall try.
- 试过这样吗？  - 没，但我们得试试

626
00:53:01,677 --> 00:53:05,625
- With Evans gone, the Gravitron is all yours.
- Je m'en occupe!
- 现在 Evans 走了，引力创归你了 - 我会处理好的（法语）

627
00:53:05,794 --> 00:53:09,054
Any further down, and the field may affect the base.
再低一点，力场就会影响基地了

628
00:53:09,224 --> 00:53:11,887
- What does that matter now?
- Ah, I suppose you're right.
- 到现在了，那又有什么关系   - 啊，我想你是对的

629
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:16,560
- Get someone to stand by that window
and relay instructions direct to Benoit.
- Right!
找个人站到那个窗户旁边，将指令转述给 Benoit

630
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:30,121
- He's ready.  - Start moving the probe down.
- 他就绪了  - 开始向下移动探测器

631
00:54:24,813 --> 00:54:27,912
- That's as far as it will go.
- What?
- 最多也就能到这个位置了
- 什么？

632
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:30,217
But it's way over their heads.
但高出他们的头太多了

633
00:54:30,382 --> 00:54:33,963
There's one chance. We'll try bringing it down by hand.
只有一次机会，我们得用手把它拉下来

634
00:54:34,136 --> 00:54:37,154
- Is this still switched off?
- No, No.. Yes, of course.
- 这个仍然是关着的吗？   - 不，不，对了，当然

635
00:54:43,054 --> 00:54:46,440
- It won't go.
- All your weight. Once more.
- 它没动  - 用上全部力气，再来一次

636
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:52,567
- It's no use. It won't shift.
- Ah, stupid of me! Of course it won't!
- 没用，它一动不动  - 啊，我真蠢，当然它不会动了

637
00:54:52,636 --> 00:54:54,872
- Why?
- The angular cut-out. It's obvious!
- 为什么？  - 角度阻断器，很显然

638
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,168
There's got to be a safety cut-out
on the angle of the probe.
探测器的角度必须得有一个安全阻断器

639
00:55:01,336 --> 00:55:03,258
Otherwise, it might affect the whole base.
否则，它就会影响整个基地

640
00:55:03,336 --> 00:55:07,258
That's done it. Stand back. Benoit can do it now.
这下可以了．往后站．Benoit 现在可以操作了

641
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,082
Switch on!
现在启动！

642
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:48,506
Well, that's taken care of the Cybermen!
好了，它可以照料赛博人了

643
00:55:48,674 --> 00:55:54,034
We've got to get this Gravitron in operation as fast as we can!
我们得尽快让引力创重新运转起来！

644
00:55:54,203 --> 00:55:57,026
- I'm so sorry we damaged it.  - What? Oh, yes...
- 很抱歉我们毁坏了它  - 什么？噢，是的...

645
00:55:58,279 --> 00:56:02,193
Nils, rig up a temporary aerial. Call up Space Control.
Nils, 架一个临时天线，联系控制中心

646
00:56:02,355 --> 00:56:07,761
Tell Rinberg we'll be operational in about two hours.
It's the best we can do.
告诉 Rinberg 我们将在大约两小时后恢复运作．最好我们也就能这样了

647
00:56:07,924 --> 00:56:13,125
Two hours! That's all we've got to 
get the world's weather under control again.
两小时，那是我们能有的时间，要让地球天气重新处于掌控之中

648
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:17,160
Benoit, take charge of your side.
And, Doctor... What the...
Benoit, 负责你那边的事情．而博士...怎么...

649
00:56:19,507 --> 00:56:22,767
It's just as well. We've enough madmen here already!
这样也行吧，我们这里疯子已经够多了

650
00:56:22,937 --> 00:56:26,518
I want to see your first weather plot in two minutes!
我期望在两分钟之内见到你的天气运行图

651
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:28,022
Come on, boys.
加油，小伙子们

652
00:56:50,057 --> 00:56:51,388
Doctor, look.
博士，看

653
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:56,099
- Could that be them?  - Possibly.
- 会是他们吗？  - 很可能

654
00:56:56,272 --> 00:56:59,210
And I hope it's the last we see of them.
我期望这是我最后一次看见他们

655
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:22,988
There we are. In perfect flight.
好啦，进入完美的飞行了

656
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:28,440
- Yes, and look what happened last time!
- Just a bumpy landing. It won't happen again.
- 是啊，看看上次都发生了什么！
- 只是着陆有点颠簸，不会再发生了

657
00:57:28,608 --> 00:57:29,973
- I know.
- What you're up now?
- 我知道  - 你又在干什么？

658
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:33,160
- Let's have a look at the Time Scanner. - The what?
- 我们来看看时间扫描仪  - 看什么？

659
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:38,496
The Time Scanner. Instead of showing where we are, 
it gives you a glimpse of the future.
时间扫描仪．不是显示我们在哪儿，而是让你瞥一眼未来

660
00:57:38,657 --> 00:57:41,802
The second sight? Very dangerous.
第二视觉？这太危险了

661
00:57:41,966 --> 00:57:46,719
