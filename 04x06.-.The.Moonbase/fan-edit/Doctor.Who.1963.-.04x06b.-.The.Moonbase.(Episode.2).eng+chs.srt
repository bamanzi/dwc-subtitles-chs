No! I'll not go with you!

Do you hear me, piper? No! Leave me!

She's right. There's another one gone.
她是对的, 又有一个不见了

19
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:48,947
Sam, Jules, you've got to find these men.
They can't just disappear in a place this size.
Sam, Jules, 你们去找这几个人．他们不可能消失了, 就这么点大个地方

until you find them. Now move.
每一寸都要搜到, 找不到他们就不要回来．快去

I went out to get Jamie some water,

- Forget that part. Then what?
- 我觉得那是个赛博人  - 忘了那个吧．然后呢？

00:19:18,107 --> 00:19:21,760
Then nothing. The door shut, and then you came in.
然后没什么了．门关上了, 然后你们进来了

We'll see about that in a minute.

Stop this Cyberman nonsense!

There were Cybermen, every child knows that,
but they were destroyed ages ago!
以前是有赛博人, 每个小孩子都知道．但他们几十年前就被消灭了！
<i>（注:  赛博人初次出现于1986年, 试图夺取地球, 后与母星 Mondas 一起毁灭

- So we all thought.

35
00:19:49,915 --> 00:19:52,205
Let's have a little calm thinking.
我们都冷静地想一想

36
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:57,556
For the past two weeks,
a complete unknown disease has appeared in the base.
过去两个星期以来, 一种完全未知的疾病出现在这个基地

37
00:19:57,726 --> 00:20:01,986
People drop in their tracks
and develop a black pattern on their skin.

38
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:04,079
Then some of the patients disappear, right?
然后又有一些病人消失了, 对不？

39
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:10,644
They can't leave the base without wearing spacesuits,
and there are no spacesuits missing. So where are they?
不穿太空服的花他们不可能离开基地, 但又没有太空服丢失．那他们在哪儿？

00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:14,511
- I must say, It does sound a little odd.
- More than a little.
- 我得说, 这事听着是有一点点奇怪  - 不是一点点

41
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:19,499
I do know one thing - a new disease starts,
people disappear, and then you turn up.
我倒的确知道一件事情 - 新疾病出现, 人们消失, 然后你们出现了

42
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,243

- Oh, come on, we haven't done a thing!
- 那你就觉得是我们干的？  - 哦, 得了, 我们什么也没干！

Perhaps maybe, I don't know who you are,
what you are, or where you came from,
也许吧, 我也不知道你们是谁, 是干什么的, 从哪里来

44
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:29,491
but you can get off the moon now!

- 好啊, 正想走呢, 越早越好！  - 不, Ben, 我们还不能走

- Because there is something evil here. We must stay.
- 为什么不？他们不想让我们在这里 - 因为这里有邪恶的东西, 我们必须留下来

- Evil is what I meant.
- 邪恶？ 别犯傻了！   - 邪恶．我说的就是这个

00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:46,882
There are some corners of the universe
which have bred the most terrible things.
宇宙中有些角落会孕育出最可怕的东西

49
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,111

that we believe in. They must be fought.
这些东西会跟我们所信仰的一切作对．我们必须跟他们斗争

50
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:57,872
This disease, for instance. It isn't really
a disease at all, but I can help you with it.
举例来说, 这个疾病, 其实并不是一种病．但我可以帮助你们

51
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:01,373
You'll see. I'll find the cause for you.
你会看到, 我会帮你们找到原因

52
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:05,404
- Will you, indeed?
- Yes, certainly. I just need to examine a few things. That's all.
- 会吗, 真的？ - 当然．我需要先检验几样东西, 仅此而已

53
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:08,983
- It should be simple.
- Well, I'm not sure.
- 那很简单  - 嗯, 我不太确定

54
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,864
I'll give you just one Earth-day cycle to find the cause.

00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:15,916
- Earth what?
- 24 hours.

56
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,492
- But that's no time at all.
- It's all you're going to get.
- 但这时间也太短了吧  - 你们只有这些时间

57
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:22,720
Then you get off the moon, with this bloke here.
然后你们就离开月球, 带着这个家伙

58
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:25,896
- You can't move him! He's very ill.
- We accept.

59
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:29,684
Now tell me, you have pathological equipment here, yes?
现在说说, 你们这里有病理分析设备吧？

It's all in here.
有．Evans 之前在做一个扩展研究项目．东西都在这里

61
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:40,191
It's quite a small unit. We're not equipped
to deal with a full-scale epidemic.
是一套小型设备, 我们并没有针对大规模传染病的配置

62
00:21:41,449 --> 00:21:44,253

- 你觉得你能搞定吗？ - 是的，我觉得我能

没事的, Jamie, 没事．你会好起来的, 但你必须要躺好

What is this place? Is it the home of the piper?
这是什么地方？这是风笛手的家吗？

Are you all right?

00:24:12,644 --> 00:24:15,300
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

- No. It's a complete blank.
- 一点线索也没有吗？  - 没有, 完全的空白

80
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:25,159

所有测试结果都是阴性的．就我所看到的来说, 这整个破地方都是无菌的

We'll have to tell Mr Hobson, I suppose.

I don't like it very much. I simply don't understand it.

Doctor, it couldn't possibly have
anything to do with Lister, could it?
博士, 这会不会跟李斯特有关, 可能吗？

83
00:24:37,002 --> 00:24:39,407
- Lister?
- Well, I mean, you did say
- 李斯特  - 这样, 我是说, 你不是说

84
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,591
that you took your degree in Glasgow in 1888.
你1888年在格拉斯哥拿到了学位

那可是一段好长的时间了, 现在是2070年了

Polly, are you suggesting that I'm not confident to carry out these tests?
Polly, 你是不是想说我并没有能力进行这些检测？

that Joseph Lister didn't know in 1888
不, 不, 我只是在想会不会有些什么东西是约瑟夫-李斯特在1888年不知道的

- Ssh! Somebody's coming!

- It's completely illogical.
- Do you mind?
- 这完全没逻辑  - 可以吗？

92
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:17,138
Would you mind standing away from the door
and allowing it to close? The slides. The dust!
你别站在门边可以吗, 让门可以关上？检测片. 灰尘！

00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:25,637
It must be you people.
We've got some straight talking to do, you and I.

- Thank you, Polly.
- 这很热. 博士, 你要吗？ - 谢谢你, Polly

Don't drink that! It's the sugar!

113
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:39,350
Don't you see? That's why the disease doesn't affect everyone.
你明白了吗？那就是为什么这个病没有感染每一个人

115
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:39,350
It's the sugar. Not everyone takes it.
