1
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:38,896
It's you.

2
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,588
The phantom piper!

3
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:43,679
No!

4
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:46,746
No! I'll not go with you!

5
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:49,921
Do you hear me, piper? No! Leave me!

6
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,942
Leave me. I'll not go with you, do you hear me?

7
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,923
Leave me! No, I'll not go with you!

8
00:17:57,096 --> 00:18:00,074
I'll fight you every inch of the way.

9
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:02,241
I'll not go with you.

10
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:11,461
Leave me, piper.

11
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:15,616
No. Leave me. I'll not go.

12
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,164
Agh!

13
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:25,880
- Molly, what's happened?
- Oh, Doctor, it was horrible!

14
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:30,387
- A giant creature like a Cyberman!
- It's all right. Don't be frightened.

15
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:34,737
- Whatever it was, it's gone now.
- It's the... Doctor, the Cyberman was carrying a patient.

16
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:38,362
- Cyberman? What are you talking about?
- I'm sure it was.

17
00:18:38,527 --> 00:18:40,417
- I'll not go with you.
- It's OK. It's safe now. Take it easy.

18
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:43,638
She's right.
There's another one gone.

19
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:48,947
Sam, Jules, you've got to find these men.
They can't just disappear in a place this size.

20
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:52,610
Search every square inch, come back until you find them. Now move.

21
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:59,011
Now, supposing you tell me your story?
What did you see?

22
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:02,312
I went out to get Jamie some water,

23
00:19:02,484 --> 00:19:08,600
and when I came back,
I saw this giant man or creature or something,

24
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:13,347
just going out of the door,
carrying one of the patients... like a doll.

25
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:17,170
- I think it was a Cyberman.
- Forget that part. Then what?

26
00:19:18,107 --> 00:19:21,760
Then nothing.
The door shut, and then you came in.

27
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:27,723
- What do you know about all this?
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

28
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:30,055
We'll see about that in a minute.

29
00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:34,326
- This thing you saw. What was it like?
- It was enormous, and silver.

30
00:19:34,494 --> 00:19:37,987
- It had holes in its head for eyes, like a robot.
- A robot?

31
00:19:38,158 --> 00:19:41,410
But the Cybermen were all killed
when Mondas blew up.

32
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:46,894
Stop this Cyberman nonsense! There were Cybermen, every child knows that, but they were destroyed ages ago!

33
00:19:47,056 --> 00:19:49,747
- So we all thought.
- That's enough.

34
00:19:49,915 --> 00:19:52,205
Let's have a little calm thinking.

35
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:57,556
For the past two weeks,
a complete unknown disease has appeared in the base.

36
00:19:57,726 --> 00:20:01,986
People drop in their tracks
and develop a black pattern on their skin.

37
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:04,079
Then some of the patients disappear, right?

38
00:20:05,377 --> 00:20:10,644
They can't leave the base without wearing spacesuits,
and there are no spacesuits missing. So where are they?

39
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:14,511
- I must say, It does sound a little odd.
- More than a little.

40
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:19,499
I do know one thing - a new disease starts, people disappear, and then you turn up.

41
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,243
- And you think we did it!
- Oh, come on, we haven't done a thing!

42
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:27,274
Perhaps maybe, I don't know who you are,
what you are, or where you came from,

43
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:29,491
but you can get off the moon now!

44
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:32,953
- Well, that suits me fine, the sooner the better!
- No, Ben, we can't go yet.

45
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:38,066
- Why not? They don't want us here.
- Because there is something evil here. We must stay.

46
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:41,529
- Evil? Don't be daft!
- Evil is what I meant.

47
00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:46,882
There are some corners of the universe
which have bred the most terrible things.

48
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,111
Things which act against everything
that we believe in. They must be fought.

49
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:57,872
This disease, for instance. It isn't really
a disease at all, but I can help you with it.

50
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:01,373
You'll see. I'll find the cause for you.

51
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:05,404
- Will you, indeed?
- Yes, certainly. I just need to examine a few things. That's all.

52
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:08,983
- It should be simple.
- Well, I'm not sure.

53
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,864
I'll give you just one Earth-day cycle
to find the cause.

54
00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:15,916
- Earth what?
- 24 hours.

55
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,492
- But that's no time at all.
- It's all you're going to get.

56
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:22,720
Then you get off the moon,
with this bloke here.

57
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:25,896
- You can't move him! He's very ill.
- We accept.

58
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:29,684
Now tell me, you have pathological
equipment here, yes?

59
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,672
Yes. Evans was working on
an extensive research project. It's all in here.

60
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:40,191
It's quite a small unit. We're not equipped
to deal with a full-scale epidemic.

61
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:44,253
- Do you think you can manage?
- Yes.

62
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:49,579
Right. I'll leave you to it.
Don't forget - 24 hours.

63
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,322
- What are you going to do, Doctor?
- We'll start with this one.

64
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:06,079
- Are you really a medical doctor?
- Yes, I think I was once, Polly.

65
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:10,061
I think I took a degree once, in Glasgow.

66
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:15,223
1888, I think. Lister. Hold that for me, will you?

67
00:22:17,643 --> 00:22:21,021
- Oh!
- All right. He's quite unconscious.

68
00:22:50,822 --> 00:22:56,492
It's all right, Jamie. It's all right.
You're going to get better but you must lie still.

69
00:22:56,661 --> 00:23:00,233
What is this place?
Is it the home of the piper?

70
00:23:00,405 --> 00:23:03,783
No, we're on the moon.
You know, the moon up in the sky.

71
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:05,792
No, I can't be alive.

72
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:08,286
I've just seen the piper.

73
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,641
The piper! I knew!

74
00:24:03,257 --> 00:24:05,834
Polly! What's happened?

75
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,788
Polly.

76
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:10,081
Are you all right?

77
00:24:12,944 --> 00:24:15,600
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

78
00:24:15,762 --> 00:24:19,942
- Isn't there any clue at all?
- No. It's a complete blank.

79
00:24:20,111 --> 00:24:25,459
All the tests are negative. As far as I can see,
this whole ridiculous place is sterile.

80
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:31,861
- We'll have to tell Mr Hobson, I suppose.
- I simply don't understand it.

81
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:36,940
Doctor, it couldn't possibly have
anything to do with Lister, could it?

82
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,507
- Lister?
- Well, I mean, you did say

83
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,691
that you took your degree in Glasgow in 1888.

84
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,471
That's an awfully long time from now, 2070, whatever it is.

85
00:24:46,081 --> 00:24:49,814
Are you suggesting that I'm not confident to carry out these tests?

86
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:55,094
No, No, I'm just wondering if there was anything
that Joseph Lister didn't know in 1888

87
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:59,567
- that might help you now.
- Ssh! Somebody's coming!

88
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:04,155
It's Mr Hobson. Out for blood - ours. Look busy! Quick!

89
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,740
That's the third person
to disappear in the past few hours.

90
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,647
- It's completely illogical.
- Do you mind?

91
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:17,238
Would you mind standing away from the door
and allowing it to close? The slides. The dust!

92
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,737
It must be you people.
We've got some straight talking to do, you and I.

93
00:25:25,902 --> 00:25:28,272
- Polly. Another boot.
- Do you hear me?

94
00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:32,091
- This is extraordinary. Look here.
- Excuse me, please.

95
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:36,286
Excuse me. We ARE trying to help you.

96
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:40,677
- Help? Is that what you call it? You can all get off the moon now.
- No, wait a minute. You said...

97
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,808
- I don't care what I said!
- Ah!

98
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:46,305
- Have you found something?
- I think perhaps I have.

99
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:52,265
Yes, I may be onto something,
but I must have some room.

100
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:57,177
How can I work under these conditions?
Now, please, come along. Outside. I'm trying to work in here!

101
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:00,920
- Ben, see that they stay outside.
- Did you mean that?

102
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,256
- What?
- You've found something?

103
00:26:04,112 --> 00:26:06,964
Oh, Polly, I only wish I had.

104
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:34,588
- Coffee? Sugar?
- Hello, Doctor. Thank you.

105
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:40,265
- It's very hot. Doctor, what about you?
- Thank you, Polly.

106
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:45,458
Doctor, as I was saying, you've had
your chance. You come up with absolutely  nothing.

107
00:26:52,188 --> 00:26:53,837
Don't touch him!

108
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,489
Let me look.

109
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:09,661
Charlie and you, Ben,
give us a hand to get him into the medical unit.

110
00:27:09,824 --> 00:27:12,308
Try not to touch his skin.

111
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:33,613
Don't drink that! It's the sugar!

112
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:39,450
That's why the disease doesn't affect everyone.
It's the sugar. Not everyone takes it.

113
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:41,623
Don't touch it.

114
00:27:54,678 --> 00:27:57,083
- What are you doing?
- Just be patient.

115
00:28:09,052 --> 00:28:10,620
Just as I thought.

116
00:28:11,387 --> 00:28:14,319
A large neurotropic virus.

117
00:28:14,488 --> 00:28:17,065
- Like the space plague?
- No.

118
00:28:17,226 --> 00:28:21,004
It's a large infective agent
that only attacks the nerves.

119
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:27,020
That's why these patients got these lines appear on faces and hands.
It follows the course of the nerves under the skin.

120
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:28,657
That's _ it well. But how did it get in here?

121
00:28:28,822 --> 00:28:33,988
It is the Cybermen. I believe
they have deliberately infected the base.

122
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:39,602
My men have searched every square of the base. There's no space to hide a cat, let alone a Cyberman.

123
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:41,418
Anyhow, how did they get in?

124
00:28:42,632 --> 00:28:44,877
- One moment.
- What is it?

125
00:28:48,108 --> 00:28:51,280
- You say you searched all the base?
- Yes. What of it?

126
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:55,629
- No chance of anyone hiding anywhere?
- None whatever.

127
00:28:56,523 --> 00:28:59,855
Did your men search in here? Did they?

128
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:03,083
- There was'nt people in here, so...
- Did they search in here?

129
00:29:03,247 --> 00:29:07,266
- No.
- There's nowhere in here they could hide.

130
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:41,970
Oh, no!
Back!

131
00:29:42,142 --> 00:29:43,744
Back.
