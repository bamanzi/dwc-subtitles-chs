Well, carry on Nurse.

I wonder who this is?

Not real! What more do you want?
不是真正的！你还想要多真？

I don't know. But there are certain signs and symptoms
which don't add up.
我不知道，但这里有一些体征和症状相互矛盾

But how?

142
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:32,610
Give a hand, do anything but keep your eyes and ears open.
帮帮忙什么的，做什么都行，不过眼睛要放亮点

143
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:33,494

There's something very wrong here. Something very wrong indeed.
这里有些事情非常不对劲，真的非常不对劲

还没睡啊, Nobby, 为什么不休息一下, 去睡一下吧

You know the score as well as I do.
噢, 有了这事儿我这么还能睡得着啊, 你跟我一样清楚现在的状态

Five units off centre and we lift half London into space!

Well, how can you help?

好了, 我走了, 去躺躺．如果有任何事就叫我

Yes, of course.
好的, 没问题

157
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:23,251
Oh, by the way, there were two more of those momentary drops
in air pressure while I was on.
哦, 顺便说一下, 我在这里的时候又出现过两次短暂的气压下降

What is that?
那是什么？

161

Shhhh, it's all right Polly. It's only me.
We don't want to wake everybody up do we?
嘘, 没事的 Polly．就我一个．我们不想吵醒每一个人吧

What's happened?!
什么情况？

169
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:56,951
Oh, it's nothing. It probably just a changeover in the time cycle.
哦, 没事．只是人工昼夜交替而已

170
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,518
What do you mean?

00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:01,314
Oh, you see - it's rather interesting really
哦, 你看, 这真的很有意思

you see on the moon, they have a fortnight of days
and a fortnight of nights.
你看看月球, 他们有长达１４天的白天和１４天的黑夜

Well?
是吗？

174
00:14:06,653 --> 00:14:11,099
Well, it's oblivious isn't it? They have to
make their own day and night artificially up there
是啊, 这很明显啊是不？他们这里就不得不靠人工制造白天和黑夜

175
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:13,799
Or it would upset their own biological time clock.
否则他们的生物钟就会紊乱

聪明. 证明完毕．这就是为什么现在这里黑了

哦, 我明白你什么意思了．对了, 当然．我真是太蠢了

181
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:30,714
Of course along the control centre it's probably broad daylight.
当然了在控制中心那边可能一直都是白天

182
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,793
Polly, you wouldn't be making fun of me would you?
Polly, 你不是在逗我吧, 是吗？

What are we gone to do?
那我们该做什么？

189
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:24,488
What does he means by the silver hand.
I better report this to Mr. Hobson.
他说＂银色的手＂是什么意思？我最好向 Hobson 先生报告一下

190
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:48,205

什么情况？

191
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:50,329
Something just went out of that door!
什么东西从那个门跑出去了！

192
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:51,817

Nothing. Nothing there.

Over there.

00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,402
All right, let's get it over with.
好了, 让我们结束吧

198
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:29,679
Is this somebody's idea of a particularly bad joke?
这是谁开的恶意玩笑吗？

199
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:31,285
This is no joke, believe me!
这不是玩笑, 相信我！

200
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:33,456
Mr. Hobson, Mr. Hobson, you are wanted!
Hobson 先生, Hobson 先生, 这里需要你

- quarantine or no quarantine.
你们最好找到医生的尸体, 否则你们都得出去 - 不管隔离不隔离

204
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:50,552
I don't understand what could have happened.
I must have dozed off or something
我不清楚刚才可能发生了什么, 我肯定是打盹了

205
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:55,252
but one thing I am sure of
- something went out of that door just as you came in.
但有一件事我可以肯定：你进来的时候有什么东西跑出那个门去了

That body can't just have vanished.
Polly, I am going to leave you alone...
