1
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:09,946
- They can't just march in here, can they?
- Not now we know how they got in.

2
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:12,607
Yes. They tunnelled into the storeroom.

3
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,317
- Come quickly!
- What is it?

4
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:23,187
<i>MoonbaseI MoonbaseI</i>

5
00:01:23,354 --> 00:01:27,509
<i>- They've got our wavelength. We hear you.
- You are surrounded.</i>

6
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:30,450
<i>All resistance is useless.</i>

7
00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:33,763
<i>You must open the entry port.</i>

8
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:39,735
Let me. You're wasting your time. We've
discovered your passageway and blocked it.

9
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,089
<i>- You cannot enter now.
- Resistance is useless.</i>

10
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:47,277
- Can they get in?
- I'm not stopping to find out.

11
00:01:47,447 --> 00:01:49,983
- Get me Earth as quick as you can.
- Right.

12
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,169
Weather Control Moon calling Earth.
Come in.

13
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,351
Switch it off. We'll never hear anything
through that. Are they jamming it?

14
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:03,748
- Perhaps.
- They're having a go at the aerial!

15
00:02:03,912 --> 00:02:06,771
Where are you going?
They'll get you in a flash!

16
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:11,094
- Someone's got to go.
- It's too late. Come and see.

17
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:29,572
They get us every way, these creatures!

18
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:31,750
I refuse to believe that!

19
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:33,893
Everything's got a weak point.

20
00:02:34,058 --> 00:02:37,927
It's just a question
of waiting till it shows up, that's all.

21
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:42,731
They'll send a relief rocket within 12 hours
if no signals are received from us.

22
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,262
A lot of good that is!

23
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,503
With all the trouble we've had, I'd say
a rocket is on its way - sent off hours ago.

24
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:55,359
- Rinberg's very quick off the trigger, right?
- I'm sure of it. With my replacement aboard.

25
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:57,824
- That's wonderful!
- Thanks

26
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:03,191
I mean we've no need to worry. The Cybermen
can't get in, and help is on its way.

27
00:03:03,358 --> 00:03:04,770
It all sounds too easy.

28
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:09,362
Watch the flight path between Moon
and Earth. Tell me if you spot anything.

29
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:11,828
All we have to do is hold on here.

30
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:15,013
Yes, that's all.
It doesn't depend on us, though.

31
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:18,408
It depends on what the Cybermen
are hatching up.

32
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:23,050
If a rocket is on its way,
they're bound to be aware of that already.

33
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:33,133
<i>EmergencyI</i>

34
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:36,723
<i>There is a spaceship
approaching from Earth.</i>

35
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:42,622
<i>It will arrive on the lunar surface
in 15 minutes.</i>

36
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:47,103
<i>Immediate offensive action must be taken.</i>

37
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,541
<i>They have blocked up our way into the base.</i>

38
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:57,065
<i>Other methods to gain entry will be tried.</i>

39
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:04,568
<i>The machine from Earth
must first be destroyed.</i>

40
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:07,966
<i>There are 14 minutes left.</i>

41
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:09,899
<i>Understood.</i>

42
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:23,220
<i>Transmit control signal.</i>

43
00:05:34,454 --> 00:05:41,112
<i>You will listen to me
and follow my instructions.</i>

44
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,097
- Switch on again.
- Without an aerial?

45
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:48,817
- We can pick up local signals.
- Local? Oh, I see... The Cybermen.

46
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:53,539
If they have any more words of cheer for us,
we might as well hear them.

47
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:01,770
<i>Those are your orders.</i>

48
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:08,383
That is correct, but watch the digital counter.

49
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:12,831
- How's he shaping?
- Not bad for a beginner...

50
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:15,084
.. but it will take a long time yet.

51
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:20,776
At least the Gravitron's stable. I don't know
how they can take it for long in that room.

52
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:25,296
How's Benson standing up to it?
He's been on for six hours on the trot.

53
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:29,092
- He says he'll be all right.
- Should he be on it alone?

54
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:34,171
You're the only other operator who
could replace him, and you're needed here.

55
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:37,247
- It's tough on him.
- It's tough on all of us...

56
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:41,038
.. but millions of lives
depend on this weather control unit.

57
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:43,901
I've brought some coffee to keep us awake.

58
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,008
- Without sugar this time, I hope?
- Of course.

59
00:06:47,177 --> 00:06:50,241
Take some to the Doctor. He's in the Dome.

60
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:23,854
<i>You will now change
field co-ordinates as instructed.</i>

61
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,003
They've spotted it
on the scanner - the relief ship.

62
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,094
- Where?
- Over here.

63
00:07:33,264 --> 00:07:36,570
- Well?
- I told you they'd be on their way!

64
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:39,594
- That's a spaceship?
- No, that's the scanner!

65
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:41,208
It's not far off.

66
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:44,636
It will be off parking orbit
in six minutes.

67
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:48,308
- You ought to warn them.
- The Cybermen will be there.

68
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,658
They've got their own warning system
and weapons.

69
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:57,235
They'll blast the Cybermen and their spaceship
to kingdom come four minutes from now.

70
00:07:59,255 --> 00:08:01,263
Come on!

71
00:08:01,434 --> 00:08:04,097
It seems to move so slowly.

72
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:13,258
- What are they doing?
- Looks like they've changed direction.

73
00:08:14,147 --> 00:08:17,372
They've changed into an escape orbit.
Follow it.

74
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:20,762
- It's too fast. I can't keep up with it.
- Keep trying.

75
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:26,252
- I can't hold it. It's accelerating too fast.
- Look out. You're on the sun.

76
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:30,041
- That's where it's going.
- The acceleration's gigantic!

77
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:35,568
- Get R/T contact with the ship.
- It's no good, sir. It's going too fast.

78
00:08:37,432 --> 00:08:39,842
They've had it, I'm afraid.

79
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:42,391
- The sun...
- Yes.

80
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:45,576
Will somebody please tell us
what it all means?

81
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:50,222
The rocket has been deflected
towards the sun. Nothing can save them now.

82
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:54,048
- Save them? What do you mean?
- From plunging into the sun.

83
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:56,516
But the sun's millions of miles away.

84
00:08:56,683 --> 00:09:01,113
Once they get into the sun's gravity belt,
they can't change course.

85
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:04,509
It may take a week but they'll end up there.

86
00:09:04,673 --> 00:09:07,899
What on earth could have caused it?

87
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:11,530
The rocket was deflected off course,
but why, and how?

88
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:13,704
Deflected?

89
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:18,305
- Yes, of course. The Gravitron!
- Have the Cybermen got a gravity weapon?

90
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:20,851
- No, but we have.
- You don't mean...?

91
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:25,447
That rocket was deflected into the sun
was from this very room.

92
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:27,224
I see what you mean.

93
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:29,529
Of course - the Gravitron.

94
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,114
- Benson must have...
- I said he'd been on duty too long.

95
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:35,696
If it IS Benson...

96
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,819
It's Evans!

97
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:53,856
- He was in the medical room.
- The Cybermen have control of them.

98
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,737
- And the other men in there?
- They may not be affected yet.

99
00:09:57,904 --> 00:10:02,496
Barricade the medical room door.
Keep them in there at all costs!

100
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:41,245
- We haven't passed any of them.
- Maybe only Evans was reactivated.

101
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:44,714
Well, we'd better keep watch just here.

102
00:10:52,143 --> 00:10:54,278
Let's stick that against the door.

103
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:58,358
- It won't hold them for long.
- They're not Cybermen. Come on.

104
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,529
Get hold of the other end.

105
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,978
- Hey!
- Behind you!

106
00:11:06,148 --> 00:11:08,524
Quick! Ram him!

107
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,030
Press the locking button.

108
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,913
It won't hold for long.
No.

109
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:19,423
Get those chairs and we'll block 'em in.

110
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:25,913
Evans, can you hear me?

111
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,997
Listen, Evans, this is Hobson talking.

112
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:36,610
Evans, you've got to concentrate.
Your brain has been altered by the Cybermen.

113
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:38,913
You're being controlled by them.

114
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:42,499
We've got one or two of those things
as well, you know.

115
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,975
You can't shoot all of us,
so why not come out of there?

116
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:49,848
What is he doing in there?

117
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:56,105
Look at the field reactors. We must get
control. He could flood half of Europe

118
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:59,576
if he keeps the Gravitron
aligned with spring tides.

119
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:02,679
We'll have to rush him.
Get those weapons out.

120
00:12:08,338 --> 00:12:11,356
<i>Resistance is useless.</i>

121
00:12:11,526 --> 00:12:15,072
<i>All further ships from Earth will be deflected.</i>

122
00:12:15,238 --> 00:12:17,648
<i>Open the air lock to us.</i>

123
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:21,287
<i>If you do not, we shall destroy the base,</i>

124
00:12:21,453 --> 00:12:23,943
<i>and you will be eliminated.</i>

125
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:25,643
Can you hear me?

126
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:30,884
<i>Everything you have said
in the past half-hour has been overheard.</i>

127
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:36,224
You can hear this, too, then. We're not done
yet, and we'll fight you to the last man.

128
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:40,494
<i>- You'll never get inside this base!
- We are in it already.</i>

129
00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:45,908
They've punctured the dome!

130
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:49,698
The oxygen masks.
Everyone take a mask over there!

131
00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:01,439
I hope that we don't lose too much oxygen.

132
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:04,673
- Can we patch it, do you think?
- We can try.

133
00:13:04,837 --> 00:13:06,846
Give me a hand off with this.

134
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:10,644
Doctor, I can't breathe.

135
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:17,790
Thank heavens! I can breathe again.

136
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,028
Oh, no!

137
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,344
- What can we patch it with?
- Nothing.

138
00:13:26,508 --> 00:13:28,242
Wait...

139
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:30,058
Over there.

140
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,653
Slide it to me but don't let go of it.

141
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:39,010
We have to do it in one action.

142
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,003
OK. Ready? Now!

143
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:51,600
Stopped them for the moment.

144
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:55,594
- I wonder for how long.
- Let's have a look.

145
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,024
Polly! Are you all right?

146
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:09,689
Yes.

147
00:14:11,386 --> 00:14:14,931
- Where's that air coming from?
- Reserve tanks of oxygen.

148
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:19,333
- Why couldn't we have had those before?
- And lose all our oxygen?

149
00:14:19,497 --> 00:14:21,505
I see.

150
00:14:27,003 --> 00:14:30,308
- It's so quiet!
- Yes, it is, isn't it?

151
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:33,010
The Gravitron's stopped!

152
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:38,293
Quick. Before he comes to. Ben! Jamie!

153
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:41,046
Joe!

154
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:44,836
We've barricaded the sick bay,
but it won't hold for ever.

155
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:48,228
Well done.
Here's another one for you.

156
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:51,331
- What do we do with him?
- That's your problem.

157
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,394
Just don't let him back here.

158
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:57,025
I'll become a copper
when I get back to 1966!

159
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:02,428
Mr Hobson, I've got an idea.

160
00:15:02,598 --> 00:15:05,984
- What do you make of this?
- Made by a laser beam, I think.

161
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:11,429
- Is there anything the Cybermen haven't got?
- A Gravitron. That's why they want yours.

162
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:14,616
We'll have to stand guard
with their cyberguns.

163
00:15:14,785 --> 00:15:19,664
Not much use. They're getting
reinforcements. Looks like another spaceship.

164
00:15:20,476 --> 00:15:22,404
Just there.

165
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:25,392
Another one!

166
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,350
<i>We have brought
reinforcements with other weapons.</i>

167
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,997
<i>You have one chance.
You must open the entry port.</i>

168
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:45,084
<i>You cannot stop us now.
You will all be completely destroyed.</i>

169
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:50,421
- What does he mean, other weapons?
- We'll soon find out. I must report this.

170
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:58,604
<i>I shall count to ten.</i>

171
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:04,503
<i>If you still stupidly remain silent,
we shall fire.</i>

172
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,837
<i>One...</i>

173
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:12,939
- They've got another weapon.
- I know. There it is.

174
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:16,969
Everybody take cover.
Get down, all of you! Doctor!

175
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:19,799
- Is the Gravitron still switched on?
- Yes.

176
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:21,454
Then I shall stay here.

177
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:27,056
<i>.. nine, ten... FireI</i>

178
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,679
<i>Again. Fire.</i>

179
00:16:48,212 --> 00:16:51,954
- What happened?
- It just deflected over the dome.

180
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:53,860
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

181
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:59,224
- The Gravitron deflected it. The force field.
- Yes. And that gives me an idea.

182
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,054
What are they doing now?

183
00:17:06,937 --> 00:17:08,831
They're packing it away.

184
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:12,014
What will they cook up next?

185
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:21,462
How far down can this be aimed? Can it be
brought to bear on the surface of the moon?

186
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:24,083
- I see!
- Well...

187
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,109
- Has it ever been tried?
- No, but we shall try.

188
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:31,225
- With Evans gone, the Gravitron is all yours.
- Je m'en occupe!

189
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:34,654
Any further down,
and the field may affect the base.

190
00:17:34,824 --> 00:17:37,487
- What does that matter now?
- You're right.

191
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:42,160
Get someone to stand by that window
and relay instructions to Benoit.

192
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:55,721
- He's ready.
- Start moving the probe down.

193
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:53,512
- That's as far as it will go.
- What?

194
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:55,817
But it's way over their heads.

195
00:18:55,982 --> 00:18:59,563
There's one chance.
We'll try bringing it down by hand.

196
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:02,754
- Is this still switched off?
- Yes.

197
00:19:08,654 --> 00:19:12,040
- It won't go.
- All your weight. Once more.

198
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,767
- It's no use. It won't shift.
- Stupid of me. Of course it won't!

199
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:20,472
The angular cut-out. It's obvious!

200
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,768
There's got to be a safety cut-out
on the angle of the probe.

201
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:32,858
Otherwise, it might affect the whole base.
That's done it. Stand back. Benoit can do it now.

202
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:34,682
Switch on!

203
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:14,106
Well, that's taken care of the Cybermen!

204
00:20:14,274 --> 00:20:19,634
We've got to get this Gravitron
in operation as fast as we can!

205
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,626
- I'm so sorry we damaged it.
- What? Oh, yes...

206
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:27,793
Nils, rig up a temporary aerial.
Call up Space Control.

207
00:20:27,955 --> 00:20:33,361
Tell Rinberg we'll be operational
in about two hours. It's the best we can do.

208
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:38,725
We've only two hours to get
the world's weather under control again.

209
00:20:38,892 --> 00:20:42,760
Benoit, take charge of your side.
And, Doctor... What the...

210
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:48,367
It's just as well.
We've enough madmen here already!

211
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:52,118
I want to see
your first weather plot in two minutes!

212
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,622
Come on, boys.

213
00:21:15,657 --> 00:21:16,988
Doctor, look.

214
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:21,699
Could that be them?
Possibly.

215
00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:24,810
And I hope it's the last we see of them.

216
00:21:58,838 --> 00:22:01,088
There we are. In perfect flight.

217
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,540
- Yes, and look what happened last time!
- Just a bumpy landing. It won't happen again.

218
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,073
I know.

219
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:11,260
- Let's have a look at the Time Scanner.
- The what?

220
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:16,596
The Time Scanner. Instead of showing where
we are, it gives you a glimpse of the future.

221
00:22:16,757 --> 00:22:19,902
The second sight? Very dangerous.

222
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:24,819
Nonsense! I haven't used it very much.
It's not very reliable, as you can see.

223
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,402
Doctor...

224
00:22:26,564 --> 00:22:28,377
Look!
