1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:44,854
Stand back, stand back from that door.

3
00:00:45,942 --> 00:00:47,101
You're right! It is them!

4
00:00:56,928 --> 00:00:57,754
Quick! Get out of it!

5
00:00:57,947 --> 00:00:58,568
No!

6
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,184
Remain still.

7
00:01:08,184 --> 00:01:11,862
You devils! You killed him! An unarmed man!

8
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:12,975
Get up.

9
00:01:15,257 --> 00:01:18,189
See that they remain there.

10
00:01:18,517 --> 00:01:19,575
Yes.

11
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:35,573
Operational System Two now complete. Operational System Two now complete.

12
00:01:43,726 --> 00:01:47,503
Ready to start Operational System Three

13
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:54,069
Understood. Operational System Three will now begin.

14
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:08,023
You are known to us.

15
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:09,840
And you to me.

16
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,329
Silence.

17
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,856
Who is in command?

18
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:22,234
I am.

19
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:24,574
You will be needed.

20
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:26,564
What have you done with my men?

21
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,207
They will return.

22
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:30,971
They're not dead?!

23
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:35,489
No. They are not dead. They are altered.

24
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:37,094
Altered? What have you done to them?

25
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:39,985
They are now controlled.

26
00:02:40,648 --> 00:02:42,392
If you do anything to my...

27
00:02:42,777 --> 00:02:44,814
You will do nothing.

28
00:02:54,762 --> 00:03:00,552
This one has not received Neurotrope. Stand back!

29
00:03:00,752 --> 00:03:04,115
Please leave him alone. He's head is hurt. He had an accident.

30
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:08,560
His head? Then he would be of no value.

31
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,641
The others are ready for conversion.

32
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:17,176
You will now take us to the control centre.

33
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:19,253
I'll be damned...

34
00:03:22,156 --> 00:03:23,254
Through here.

35
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:40,002
You will remain here. If you leave you will be converted like the others.

36
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:47,980
I don't like that word - "converted. "

37
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:08,209
Raise your left arm.

38
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:14,045
Raise your right arm.

39
00:04:16,602 --> 00:04:19,838
Control is excellent.

40
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:23,894
Transfer that one to the capsule.

41
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:47,747
It's about time that we heard from those two outside. Let's have a word with them.

42
00:04:48,408 --> 00:04:49,828
All yours, Roger.

43
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,952
Survey party, come in please.

44
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:56,835
Survey party, come in please.

45
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,358
Survey party, come in, we are not receiving you, over.

46
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:18,885
Can we see the control antenna from here?

47
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:21,434
No, Roger. It's just around that first block just outside the main port.

48
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:24,747
So, we have to send somebody outside so get ready...

49
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,667
We have to...

50
00:05:25,873 --> 00:05:27,592
Get back! Get back! These things are lethal!

51
00:05:27,872 --> 00:05:30,424
None will move.

52
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:38,002
You will remain still. If you move you will be killed.

53
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:39,832
What are they?! How did they get in!?

54
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:45,667
Silence! We are Cybermen! You will listen.

55
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,271
But you were all killed!

56
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:59,406
We are going to take over the Gravitron and use it to destroy the surface of the Earth by changing the weather.

57
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,146
But that will kill everybody on the Earth.

58
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:02,343
Yes.

59
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:08,139
You're supposed to be so advanced. Here you are, taking your revenge like children.

60
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:11,316
Revenge? What is that?

61
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:13,606
A feeling people have...

62
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:24,568
Feelings? Yes, we know of this weakness of yours. We are fortunate. We do not posses feelings.

63
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:26,957
Then why are you here?

64
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,167
To eliminate all dangers.

65
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:33,748
But you kill every single thing on the Earth!

66
00:06:33,962 --> 00:06:38,082
Yes. All dangers will be eliminated.

67
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,641
Have you no mercy?

68
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:41,892
It is unnecessary.

69
00:06:42,996 --> 00:06:45,676
Keep watch on them.

70
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:50,149
Don't rush them!

71
00:06:50,401 --> 00:07:04,319
Operational System Four. Operation System Four. Operational System Four complete. Entry to base now completed.

72
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:06,719
Entry? How did you get in?

73
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:15,463
It was very simple. Only stupid Earth brains like yours would have been fooled.

74
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:16,489
Go on.

75
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:33,292
Since we couldn't approach direct, we came up under the surface and cut our way in through your store room, contaminating your food supply on the way. A simple hole that's all.

76
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:38,167
A hole! That explains those sudden air pressure drops we been having.

77
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,914
Clever! Clever! Clever!

78
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,553
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

79
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:49,816
You seem to be better.

80
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:51,173
Aye, I feel myself again.

81
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:52,261
Lie back there!

82
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:53,298
But I'm better!

83
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:55,481
Oh, my head.

84
00:07:55,698 --> 00:07:56,983
Well, take it easy, mate.

85
00:07:57,378 --> 00:07:59,556
At least, you know it is not your McCrimmon piper.

86
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:01,973
It had me worried though, I admit that.

87
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:05,648
Yeah, those Cybermen have got us all worried mate. We see them in action before.

88
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:08,569
They must have some weakness.

89
00:08:08,877 --> 00:08:12,397
They have, don't you remember. They can't stand radiation.

90
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,217
But where do we find that here?

91
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:18,616
There's the Gravitron power pack but that's thermonuclear. None can get near it once its going.

92
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:19,743
Why not?

93
00:08:19,923 --> 00:08:23,095
Because Duchess, the temperature inside is about four million degrees, that's all.

94
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,210
Well, in my day, they used to sprinkle witches with holy water.

95
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:28,137
Fat lot of use that would be on them.

96
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:33,279
Sprinkle... Holy Water... Ben!

97
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:34,275
Yeah?

98
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:35,694
What are the Cybermen covered in?

99
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,404
As far as I know, their suit is a metal of some sort.

100
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:44,235
What about that thing on their chests? You know the part that replaced their heart and lungs.

101
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:45,586
Some kind of plastic I think.

102
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:56,505
I thought so. You see, it's simple. Nail vanish remover dissolves nail vanish. Nail vanish is a plastic so we do what Jamie says, we sprinkle them, see?!

103
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,448
No, clear as mud if you ask me.

104
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,166
Anyway, I am going to try an experiment.

105
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:02,561
Yes, Professor.

106
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,384
Dr. Evans! I thought that they were all dead!

107
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:23,703
Better if they were by the look of it.

108
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:39,528
You will leave your places. Go over there.

109
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:54,047
You will move. Tell the operators in the power unit to come out.

110
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:56,561
Now.

111
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:09,191
All right, you can all see what is happening. Come on out, leave the machine and don't try anything.

112
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:29,209
They will now take over the Gravitron power unit.

113
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,361
Yes.

114
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:56,416
But you can't send them in their without protected helmets.

115
00:10:56,678 --> 00:10:57,603
Why?

116
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:03,570
The machine produces very intense sonic fields. Without the helmets, those men will be insane in a few hours!

117
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:05,625
How many hours?

118
00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:07,081
Twelve possibly.

119
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:09,826
Then there is no problem.

120
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:10,676
Why?

121
00:11:10,923 --> 00:11:14,474
Our purpose will be achieved before that.

122
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,371
But what about the men?

123
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:20,338
They will be disposed of.

124
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,226
Ben?

125
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:45,380
Yep?

126
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:47,232
What is nail vanish remover?

127
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:49,899
Sort of finish, sort of acetone isn't it?

128
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,519
Acetone, of course!

129
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:56,249
Great, we have some of that.

130
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:04,418
Now, keep your fingers crossed.

131
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:08,158
It's works!

132
00:12:08,422 --> 00:12:09,907
But I still don't know what you are on about.

133
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:14,003
If we can sprinkle some of that on their chest units, it might help to soften them.

134
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,695
I get it! It will clobber their controls or something.

135
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:17,773
Yes, that's it.

136
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:21,558
Yeah, but how do we know that acetone will dissolve their sort of plastic?

137
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:23,340
Hmmm, haven't thought of that.

138
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:26,699
Just a moment though, if we make up a mixture.

139
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:28,165
Of all the solvents.

140
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:29,251
What have we got?!

141
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:33,752
Belezine, Ether, Alcohol.

142
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:35,468
We brew up a right little cocktail.

143
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:36,432
Yes.

144
00:12:36,878 --> 00:12:38,906
Wait a minute, how are we going to throw it at them?

145
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:45,357
Well, in bottles I suppose. Just a tick though, I got a better idea.

146
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:53,176
Prepare to align the field rectors.

147
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:08,276
Main power into projected radius now.

148
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:19,404
Service pumps to full pressure.

149
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:22,000
Why have they gone to so such trouble?

150
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:22,973
What do you mean?

151
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:25,032
Why didn't they operate the control themselves?

152
00:13:38,473 --> 00:13:40,757
What is happening?

153
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:43,702
There is loss of control.

154
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,441
Thought so, sonic control. That should be easy.

155
00:13:52,276 --> 00:14:20,611
Funny. Funny. To go to all that trouble to make the men do the work. Why? Do it themselves, easy. They're using the men as tools. Why? Don't know. Yes, I do though. There must be something in here they don't like. Pressure? No, no. Electricity? No. Radiation? Maybe. Grav... Gravity! Now there's a thought. Gravity. Oh yes, Gravity.

156
00:14:21,144 --> 00:14:29,482
Start probe generators. Realign the probe.

157
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:46,872
Probe field to full power. Now.

158
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:53,704
They devastate the whole Earth when that field takes hold.

159
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:55,099
We got to do something.

160
00:14:56,152 --> 00:14:58,682
Earth Control calling Moonbase. Come in please.

161
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:01,532
Remain still.

162
00:15:01,741 --> 00:15:04,023
Hello Moonbase, come in please.

163
00:15:04,214 --> 00:15:05,706
You will all be silent.

164
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:16,198
Moonbase, come in please. Hello? Hello? Reading on five centimetre band. Come in. Your last routine signal was not received, over.

165
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:26,707
We are not receiving you, over. If you hear us and cannot transmit, fire sodium rocket. We will see the flare.

166
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:29,611
What does that mean?

167
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:36,474
It is a distress rocket. It injects sodium into space and the sunlight turns the sodium into a solar flare.

168
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:41,010
What will your Earth do if they do not see the flare?

169
00:15:41,223 --> 00:15:43,534
Well, they'll think...

170
00:15:43,747 --> 00:15:45,029
...we're all dead, they'll do nothing.

171
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:48,151
Standing by to observe flare. Standing by...

172
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:54,166
If they don't get our next transmission, they'll send up a relief rocket.

173
00:15:55,276 --> 00:16:06,292
So, get it. This bottle holds the stuff that puts the fire out and this cylinder pushes gas into the bottle so that the stuff comes out here. Now, all we got to do is to undo it...

174
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:11,399
Poar! Empty it and fill it with Polly cocktail.

175
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,713
I got it all ready here.

176
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,429
Good. What did you put in it?

177
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:18,219
Let's think... Belezine, Ether, Alcohol, Acetone and Profane.

178
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:20,207
Blimey, one of them should do it.

179
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:21,988
Now, we need another one of these.

180
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:22,811
Right I'll get it.

181
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:23,854
No, you stay where you are Jamie.

182
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,197
Jamie, youre not well enough.

183
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:28,326
It's take more than a wee crack on the head to keep a McCrimmon down.

184
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:31,104
Look mate, we don't want you cracking up on us. I'm sure Polly's very impressed...

185
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:34,179
Look I said, I'm feeling better. Now, would you like me to prove it to you?

186
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:35,251
Any time, mate.

187
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:38,397
Now, come on. Haven't we got enough trouble without you two fighting.

188
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:39,097
I go.

189
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,313
Come on then.

190
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,346
Not you, Polly. This is men's work.

191
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,307
You'll kill them!

192
00:16:54,614 --> 00:17:01,414
If you will not remain silent you will be put under brain control.

193
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:19,189
Polly! I thought that I told you to stay behind.

194
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:20,035
I'm coming with you.

195
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:21,102
Maybe not, now go back.

196
00:17:21,313 --> 00:17:23,861
I'm coming with you and that's that! You still need someone...

197
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:24,660
I don't want...

198
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:27,826
Look! There's no time for that now. If you're coming, come on.

199
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:41,399
Now look, we only have one chance at this. When I open the door, drop down as low as you can, aim this things... at their chests and squirt like mad. Right?

200
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:42,203
Right.

201
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:43,056
Get ready.

202
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:47,588
Someone is there.

203
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,847
The beam is jammed!

204
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:00,513
Quick, get their chest things!

205
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:26,998
Quick, get these things off their heads!

206
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:41,739
Come on! Quick, there isn't a moment to lose. We got to get the Gravitron down to base level.

207
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:42,987
What about those poor men?

208
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:45,166
Shift them off to the medical unit, as quick as you can.

209
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:55,224
We are not receiving you. We are not receiving you.

210
00:18:56,217 --> 00:18:59,290
They must have failed.

211
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:06,517
Yes. We must invade now. Prepare the weapons.

212
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:08,052
Yes.

213
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:18,937
Before all this, we lost contact with those two men outside.

214
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:20,374
Well, send somebody else out.

215
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:22,492
Can't spare anyone. I'll go myself.

216
00:19:22,682 --> 00:19:25,066
Field strength is stable, isn't it?

217
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,971
Yes. Yes, it's all right.

218
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:30,445
Keep in RT contract and be quick.

219
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:32,487
Nils?

220
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:33,342
Yep?

221
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:37,918
Hook your controls into Joe's channel and keep an eye on Roger when he's outside.

222
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:38,954
Right.

223
00:19:55,099 --> 00:20:01,241
Hello Base, Hello Base. I've found them. Hmm, At least, I found their suits. They got them, I'm afraid.

224
00:20:01,636 --> 00:20:05,193
Well, there's nothing we can do about that now. You better come inside as quick as you can.

225
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:06,185
I will.

226
00:20:06,477 --> 00:20:10,531
Sir, sir! There's one of those things outside. He's after Roger Benoit.

227
00:20:10,763 --> 00:20:11,881
You hear that, Roger?

228
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:16,900
Yes, I did but he must be mistaken. There's none to be seen around here.

229
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,287
No! No!

230
00:20:34,912 --> 00:20:38,274
Did you see that? Those things don't work in the vacuum!

231
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:45,182
Why can't you squirt it at them, like you did just now?

232
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,258
Because duchess, it would evaporate in the vacuum before it hits them. There, now come on.

233
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:46,471
Come on, quick.

234
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,714
They're in! That fellow Ben got one of them.

235
00:22:25,974 --> 00:22:26,711
That was Ben?

236
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:36,364
Now listen everybody. I don't know how many more of these Cybermen there are, but our point of view we are under siege. I'll reckon they will be back in a bit...

237
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:40,002
Now communications. Charlie, keep trying to get through to Earth. Right?

238
00:22:40,174 --> 00:22:40,808
Right, will do.

239
00:22:41,007 --> 00:22:46,522
The rest of you, lower the armoured doors at all exits. Make up as much of that gubbins that you got, we may need it.

240
00:22:48,106 --> 00:22:49,057
Well done, Ben!

241
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:50,506
Ground radar?

242
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:51,763
Ground radar speaking.

243
00:22:51,928 --> 00:22:53,002
Have you got a fix on their ship yet?

244
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:58,651
Yes, Mr Hobson, we are getting a strong pulse from five four degrees North about three kilometres.

245
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:00,713
That makes it over the rim.

246
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:04,189
Mr Hobson, how far can the probe be lowered down?

247
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:05,517
About thirty degrees.

248
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,324
That's no good.

249
00:23:06,477 --> 00:23:07,353
What do you mean?

250
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:09,235
Can any other part be lowered?

251
00:23:09,577 --> 00:23:13,071
Well, the main coil lenses can be shifted about without too much trouble but too much trouble...

252
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:14,200
There's something outside there!

253
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:15,027
What is it?

254
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:16,012
It's a long way off.

255
00:23:16,327 --> 00:23:17,140
I'll come.

256
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,920
Oh, it's freezing. Do you think we should have our suits on?

257
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:27,214
Oh no, it's all right love. Get a gorgeous suntan.

258
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:29,586
Can't see anything.

259
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:32,177
Just to the left of the launching area. Around a bit to your left.

260
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:35,883
Still can't see anything.

261
00:23:36,362 --> 00:23:38,472
No, it's there, look! Reflections from the sun!

262
00:23:45,865 --> 00:23:47,750
You're right. There is something.

263
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:40,248
It's them! Everybody back inside! Quick!
