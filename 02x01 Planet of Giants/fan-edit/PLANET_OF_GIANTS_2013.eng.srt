5
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:00,985
We're approaching a planet.

6
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,391
Which one?

7
00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:04,369
We shall soon see.

8
00:01:04,404 --> 00:01:05,127
Ow.

9
00:01:05,162 --> 00:01:06,048
What's the matter my dear?

10
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,036
I burnt myself on the console.

11
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:12,361
Oh, something overheating here. Just as well we're
landing? Er, Susan, check the fault locator please.

12
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:13,495
Yes Grandfather.

13
00:01:13,529 --> 00:01:14,830
We're not going to blow
up or anything are we?

14
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:16,231
Oh no no no, of course not.

15
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:20,273
It's just, well, there we were in the late eighteenth century 

16
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:24,873
and I tried another frequency to sidestep the ship back 
into the middle of the twentieth century.

17
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:28,588
GRANDFATHER, THE DOORS, THEY'RE OPENING!

18
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,790
What's happening... Unbelievable!

19
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,129
Chesterton close the doors please! We
haven't materialised properly! Quickly!

20
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:38,831
- What do you mean close the doors?
- Don't argue dear boy

21
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:41,067
 it's an emergency,
close the doors! Quick! Use force!

22
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,114
Is everything alright?

23
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:04,857
We're just landing.

24
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,669
Are you alright Doctor?

25
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:17,703
.....what?

26
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:18,604
Are you alright?

27
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,438
Oh please, don't bother me!

28
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:20,539
What happened just then?

29
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,544
Susan, go back to the fault locator, 

30
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:25,144
and I want you to check everything, 
child you understand, EVERYTHING!

31
00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:27,213
Well at least we seem to be alright.

32
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,849
Mm? Oh don't be childish, they opened!

33
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:34,983
The doors opened before we
had properly materialised!

34
00:02:35,286 --> 00:02:36,688
But what does it mean?

35
00:02:36,754 --> 00:02:37,589
Hah-ah!

36
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:40,525
Doctor, you needn't
keep it a secret from us!

37
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:41,292
What?

38
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:43,227
Doctor, don't keep us in suspense.

39
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:47,265
Oh don't go on with these futile questions!
Please, can't you understand, can't you see?!

40
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:49,033
No we can't
- that's just it!

41
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,605
Oh we were just about to materialise when the
doors opened and we hadn't properly adjusted!

42
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:55,673
You mean something went out of the ship?

43
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,975
No that's impossible!

44
00:02:56,975 --> 00:02:58,309
Came inside then?

45
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:02,814
Oh please, don't keep talking on the
twentieth-century level! I'm talking about time-travel!

46
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:07,151
Neither of you can understand what
I'm talking about I can s-see that!

47
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,854
How could we, you've
never explained it to us!

48
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:10,855
My dear boy...

49
00:03:10,888 --> 00:03:14,392
Grandfather everything's alright! There isn't
a fault anywhere, not even on yellow standby!

50
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,632
But there must be something wrong, Susan! 

51
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,921
I shall have to check that fault locator myself 
to make sure, excuse me...

52
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,369
Oh I do wish he
wouldn't talk in riddles!

53
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:29,374
So do I. Susan perhaps you can help us?

54
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:34,012
I just know that the most dangerous
moment is at the point of materialisation.

55
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,154
Nothing's ever happened to us before.

56
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:38,116
Well the doors have never
opened like that before.

57
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:44,258
Well, happily no harm's been done. It's most puzzling.

58
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:47,558
Oh my dear Barbara was I rude to you just now? If so, I'm so sorry.

59
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:52,096
I-I always forget the
niceties under pressure. Please forgive me.

60
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,531
There's nothing to forgive.

61
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,033
Thank you. Hm.. Hah!

62
00:03:57,102 --> 00:04:00,041
Well I suppose everything's alright. And yet, er... 

63
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:03,841
See the temperature there is perfectly...
it's quite safe to go outside.

64
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:07,979
Oh Susan, just turn on the scanner a
minute, let's try and see where we are.

65
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,684
<i>Doctor!</i>

66
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:14,686
Perhaps you need a new tube Doctor?

67
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:16,220
Did you notice the way it blew out?

68
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:19,223
It was like an internal explosion.

69
00:04:19,223 --> 00:04:21,659
Yes, like, like ehh...something
too big for it's frame!

70
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:22,594
Yes.

71
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,362
And yet, I don't know...
That can't be right!

72
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:27,933
What do we do now Doctor? Take
the scanner out and strip it down?

73
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:31,572
Oh no no no, dear boy. No, it's most puzzling of course, 

74
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:33,970
but now don't know what's behind those doors.

75
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:36,808
Well we must go outside and look.
You said it was quite safe...

76
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:40,611
Yes...I wonder why the..?
Well, we must see.

77
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:42,612
- Shall I open the doors Grandfather?
- Er, yes please Susan.

78
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:45,214
But all of you, cautiously please!

79
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:56,259
Doctor, what made the doors open before?

80
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,763
The space pressure was far too
great whilst we were materialising.

81
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:04,872
The strange thing is that we all came out of it unscathed!

82
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:09,372
Hah, it's, it's most puzzling, 
it's a big mystery my boy, come along...

83
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:11,874
It's like a mountain pass or something.

84
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:21,784
Now why wouldn't the
scanner show us all this mm?

85
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:24,656
Perhaps that was the only damage to the ship, Doctor. 

86
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:26,656
Overloading on the scanner circuits.

87
00:05:28,057 --> 00:05:30,293
Yes, I suppose so it could be...

88
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:33,763
What a strange rock formation!

89
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:35,698
Yes, it is, isn't it?

90
00:05:35,698 --> 00:05:38,201
There are two different
types of rock. Doctor?

91
00:05:38,234 --> 00:05:39,135
Mm?

92
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:41,300
Look... This is ordinary stone up here, 

93
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:44,300
but this down here seems to be quite different.

94
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:54,417
Chesterton, here. Come here,
look here. Is that cement? Heh.

95
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:57,186
Might be.

96
00:05:57,186 --> 00:05:59,122
Rather a rough kind isn't it?

97
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:04,861
Mn, very rough. They look like
pebbles of sand don't they?

98
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:08,567
Yes, yes as a matter of fact it's in a way
to hold the stone in place. 

99
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:10,467
You know to fix it firmly beneath!

100
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,769
I would have thought the stone was
heavy enough to keep itself in place.

101
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:14,437
Yes, it's all most odd
isn't it? Most odd...

102
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:17,463
Now Barbara, I suggest that you and I take that path, 

103
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:20,343
and Susan and you sir, er, go that way, mm?

104
00:06:21,778 --> 00:06:26,249
Yes alright, but stay within calling distance,
and you see anything sing out. We'll do the same.

105
00:06:26,316 --> 00:06:28,385
Yes, yes, yes... Mmm.

106
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:29,886
Mm...

107
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,189
Now take this rock here,
it's most extraordinary...

108
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:37,794
Doctor! Doctor, it's a huge snake!

109
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:39,129
What, eh?

110
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:40,964
Let's call the others.

111
00:06:40,997 --> 00:06:46,102
Oh, er, wait wait wait...
Yes, I-I I think it's dead.

112
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,067
Ian! Look at this.

113
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,807
That's odd. I suppose it couldn't
be an egg, hah. Not that size.

114
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:58,777
There are more of them over there, look.

115
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,646
Yeah. Ostrich?

116
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:04,149
It would have been rounder than this.

117
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:11,423
There are dozens of them over
here! There's a whole pile of them!

118
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:17,896
Oh! Ian, Ian!

119
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:24,903
It is dead isn't it?

120
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:37,582
Yes. It's dead alright
- stiff as a poker. What a fantastic size!

121
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:39,551
Yes.

122
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:42,587
It's a giant ant.

123
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,460
It is like it isn't he? It looks as
if it was trying to carry these eggs.

124
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:52,764
Yes, well that's natural behaviour for an ant,
when it's attacked, take the eggs to safety.

125
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,368
The worker ant would give his life
rather than abandon the eggs you know...

126
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:58,737
Well he couldn't have had
much of a chance could he?

127
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:01,106
I mean he must have died quickly.

128
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:08,246
Yeah... All these eggs scattered about.
Other ants must have been frightened away.

129
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:17,856
I wonder what sort of a world
could produce an insect that size?

130
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:20,929
Well here we are then, this is the tail end of it, 

131
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,520
- And I know what it is. It's a huge earthworm.
- What?!

132
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:26,782
Yes, there are no earthworms
this size on your planet.

133
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:28,250
You're right there aren't!

134
00:08:28,284 --> 00:08:33,089
know except for it's size, I would
swear that it came from your world.

135
00:08:33,122 --> 00:08:36,459
However, lets..er,
let's go on. Come along.

136
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:41,665
Now this is really baffling!

137
00:08:49,607 --> 00:08:52,643
A huge picture of Night Scented Stock!

138
00:08:52,676 --> 00:08:56,388
Yes it is, but why put up a picture of it? I don't get it.

139
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,708
Ah, some writing there... "Alf's Seed Company, Norwich!"

140
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:05,589
Norwich! That's England isn't it? Norfolk!

141
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:10,294
Yes, it is. Susan, this
means we're on Earth!

142
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:17,001
Something's very odd here,
first those ants, now this.

143
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,492
Hey, look at the end
of that, it's all charred!

144
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,229
Yes, you can see quite clearly
what this is. It's a matchstick.

145
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,496
Well it certainly looks like one.

146
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,799
No, it just doesn't look
like one, it is a matchstick.

147
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:27,967
What, that size?!

148
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,438
Don't you see, that huge earthworm and now this? 

149
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:32,735
Can't you see what's happened Mm?

150
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:45,591
Look at this matchbox!

151
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:03,512
It must be an exhibition Susan, something like the world fair. 

152
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:07,547
- Things this size...
- No Ian.

153
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:11,084
Well what else? look
at the scale of things!

154
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:13,152
You're wrong Ian, completely wrong!

155
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:19,625
I-I thought just now that something was
wrong when I saw that, but now I'm sure.

156
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,128
Alright, what's your theory then?

157
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:26,532
That these things haven't been made
bigger, we've been made smaller!

158
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:27,767
Smaller?!

159
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,836
We have been reduced roughly
to the size of an inch!

160
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,572
An inch?!

161
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:36,309
Mm. You, me all of us, and the ship!

162
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:52,992
We must get hold of the others
quickly and return to the TARDIS!

163
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,748
What's that?

164
00:11:00,184 --> 00:11:01,418
Run Susan, run!

165
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,353
Look urgh!

166
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:22,957
Yeah.. Well it looks a
tremendous distance to me.

167
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:28,798
There's a house over there, and there's
a man sitting down reading something. 

168
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:31,600
It's a notebook I think.

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,334
- Did he have the matchbox?
- How do I know?!

170
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:37,104
I don't know how you know,
but you surprise me sometimes.

171
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:38,971
Yes, I suppose so. Look, watch
what you're doing will you?!

172
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:42,876
Look, Doctor give us some hope, I
mean, Ian's inside that matchbox!

173
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:44,608
Gently, gently gently!

174
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:46,279
We've got to find Chesterton!

175
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:48,115
But Grandfather, supposing the
man walks off with the matchbox!

176
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:51,655
Have courage my dear! I know that all of this is a bit of a nightmare,

177
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:55,255
but we've just got to get Ian back and then we can go back to the ship.

178
00:11:55,288 --> 00:11:57,090
And then can you get
us back to normal size?

179
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:59,665
But of course, yes I'll try! There's always a chance! 

180
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,565
But first things first, we must find Chesterton

181
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:06,868
It's Mr Forester isn't it?
We spoke on the telephone...

182
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:10,739
Yes, I got here as quickly as I could.
I hope you haven't taken any action yet?

183
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,008
Not yet, but I have written my report.

184
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,047
You do realise what's at stake here Mr Farrow? 

185
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,047
The early experiments were noted
by the ministry, welcomed in fact!

186
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:23,985
I've already geared factories, advertising
and all the rest of it to start pushing DN6.

187
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:27,889
I'm sorry about that, but I can't
give you the approval that you want.

188
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:30,250
I see.

189
00:12:32,523 --> 00:12:37,561
You're aware of course that if it doesn't
go into production I shall be completely ruined?

190
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:42,566
That is very unfortunate, but really, you
should have waited till we gave you the go-ahead!

191
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,904
Well that's all very well, 
but it doesn't help me does it? 

192
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:47,604
Surely we can work something out?

193
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,141
There's a fortune to
be made out of this...

194
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,211
I don't think I want to go
on with this conversation.

195
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:58,880
Do you know why I am a success Mr Farrow? 

196
00:12:59,123 --> 00:13:04,680
Because I've never allowed the word "can't"
to exist, there's always a way, always!

197
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,148
Not this time.

198
00:13:06,148 --> 00:13:10,892
This isn't business, this is science, the formulae is unacceptable 

199
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:16,492
And I can't and I do mean can't Mr Forester,
allow DN6 to go into production!

200
00:13:21,864 --> 00:13:23,899
Now I'll make that phone call.

201
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:25,367
Just a moment!/

202
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:32,590
I think It's dead.

203
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:33,658
But it could still sting!

204
00:13:33,658 --> 00:13:37,428
Mm. Hah-ha! What an
awe-inspiring sight!

205
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:44,068
Now what chance would human-beings have I really
wonder, in a world of creatures like this bee, mm?

206
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:45,269
None at all!

207
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,138
Little closer look...

208
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,646
Well I haven't taken my eyes off it 
Grandfather, it hasn't even trembled.

209
00:13:53,852 --> 00:13:55,346
It seems you're right, it is dead.

210
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:57,948
The same distinctive aroma!

211
00:13:57,948 --> 00:14:00,017
Yes, I've noticed it on
all the other dead things.

212
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,619
Well that must be
what's killing them then.

213
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:03,721
I wonder what would want to
kill off nature like this?

214
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:06,223
Well what worries me is all the
different things it's killing.

215
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:08,596
Things that fly in the air, things that move on the ground...

216
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:12,096
things that move under the ground. So indiscriminate.

217
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:13,764
- Doctor?
- Mm?

218
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:18,002
Whatever it is that's killing these
things... Could it kill us too?

219
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:20,709
Well, we must presume that it can. 

220
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:25,609
So no eating or drinking until we've
done our very best to find Ian mm?

221
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:28,245
<b>(A roaring boom momentarily
splits through the heady silence.)</b>

222
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:15,188
He's been shot dead.

223
00:15:15,188 --> 00:15:16,856
- Are you sure he is dead?
- Oh yes

224
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,493
Nothing but death all around us!

225
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:21,895
Yes, what's happening here?

226
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,433
You weren't with us Chesterton, but
every insect we came across was dead.

227
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,270
Yes, Susan and I saw a
great many huge dead ants.

228
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,939
Everything else was the same, Ian.

229
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,345
Yes, and we don't know 
what it is that killed them.

230
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:38,245
But that man, he's been shot.
Murdered!

231
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,349
But who'd kill insects in
a perfectly ordinary garden?

232
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:43,954
I mean pests one can understand, but...

233
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:47,545
Surely it's wrong to kill bees
and worms and things isn't it?

234
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:50,490
Quite so. Both are vital
to the growth of things.

235
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:53,865
However, we must leave this little mystery and get back to the ship. 

236
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:58,665
As I said my dear, it's fortunate for 
all of us us that everything is dead...

237
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:01,501
Argh! Grandfather!/

238
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,139
Don't move, any of you.

239
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:11,398
And whatever you do,
don't look into the cat's eyes. 

240
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:13,158
Close your own if you want to.

241
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:17,771
Doctor, I think the
cat's losing interest.

242
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:21,995
Don't relax! One swipe of it's
paw would smash us to pieces!

243
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:33,558
Well we can't get back to the ship just
yet, and you know how fast cats can move.

244
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:36,397
And another thing, we could be mistaken for mice

245
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:39,297
and I don't fancy being part of the cat's diet!

246
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,390
Oh it gets more horrifying every moment!

247
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:43,483
Look, couldn't we make contact
with the people here somehow?

248
00:16:43,518 --> 00:16:43,805
No, I'm afraid not.

249
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,845
Well why not, they
might be able to help us.

250
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,405
It's out of the question my dear, how
could we possibly communicate with them?

251
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,417
Imagine a record played 
at the wrong speed, Susan. 

252
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,217
We'd sound like a little squeak to them, 
and they'd sound like a low growl to us.

253
00:16:55,252 --> 00:16:58,111
Anyway, even if we could communicate, 
what would they do to us?

254
00:16:58,146 --> 00:17:02,018
We're freaks. They'd put us in a glass
case and examine us through a microscope!

255
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,548
Oh that's a thought isn't it.

256
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,596
And I would add another
and more important factor.

257
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:10,678
The people that live in this house
are murderers, or one of them is.

258
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:18,429
Therefore, we can't expect sympathy and
understanding from an insane or a criminal mind!

259
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:20,992
Yes, what about that dead man?

260
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:22,421
Oughtn't we to do something about it?

261
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:26,301
Well what can we do my dear? I
mean, surely this is the question.

262
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:30,855
Normally I wouldn't hesitate, but the 
destruction of the life-force is frightful, 

263
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:32,987
but there it is! I mean, what can we do as we are?

264
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:39,037
Well, I can't see any sign of that cat, 
however much safety that gives us.

265
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:40,236
Well, shall we proceed?

266
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:43,875
I can see a huge leg coming, run!

267
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,942
This...this way!

268
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:47,523
- No, Barbara
- Go on, Susan!

269
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:48,723
- I'd like to help you, Ian.
- Go on!

270
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:50,723
- Sorry!
- It's alright. This way, quickly!

271
00:17:51,512 --> 00:17:52,756
Oh, Grandfather, they're overstepping on us!

272
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:55,722
Oh they're alright, they're alright. It's
a pity they didn't come this way though.

273
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:56,931
Well shall we go over to them?

274
00:17:57,026 --> 00:17:59,565
No, no, it's dangerous! Let's
go over to that pipe there!

275
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:20,591
Come on Barbara, get out of
here before it moves again.

276
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:23,291
- Oh...that was worse than the big dipper.
- It was. 

277
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,845
You know we were
lucky this case was full.

278
00:18:29,393 --> 00:18:33,739
Course, it had to happen to us, 
of all the places to pick, hah,

279
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:35,435
we had to choose one that was movable!

280
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:37,139
Have you any idea where we are?

281
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:40,623
That's a ceiling up there. 

282
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:45,578
That means we're indoors and 
the Doctor and Susan are outside.

283
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:46,903
Let's move the body.

284
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:53,192
Where can we put him?

285
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:55,702
In a store room.

286
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:24,420
They've gone

287
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:30,562
It's much better when they're
a long way away, isn't it?

288
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:34,015
Are you sure you saw one of
them pick up the briefcase 

289
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:35,210
and go into that building behind us?

290
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,442
Well I definitely saw
him pick up the briefcase.

291
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:41,189
Well when he walked past us it was
just like a mountain just a blur, you know. 

292
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:43,949
But he must have gone inside the house!

293
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:47,453
Careful Grandfather, well
don't fall down there will you?

294
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:54,330
Oh-hah-Ooh POO! FAWF! An awful
smell of chemical in there!

295
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:55,930
Oh yes.

296
00:19:55,965 --> 00:19:57,718
Foof! Oh, hm.

297
00:19:57,753 --> 00:19:59,385
It's not just an
ordinary drainpipe is it?

298
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,091
Now, I wonder if that pipe extends
into the room where that briefcase went.

299
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:05,727
Are you thinking of
climbing up the inside of it?

300
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:07,589
Yes, yes of course my
dear, there's no other way.

301
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:12,610
If you go in there you'll see it's all corroded
so there's plenty of hand and foot holds.

302
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,666
And that chemical smell
means that it's germ free.

303
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,614
Oh, but it's too far
for you grandfather!

304
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:22,530
Well If it is, then I shall have to give up,
and I'm not going to give up before I've tried.

305
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:24,404
And remember you must think of the other two, 

306
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:28,634
They must be constantly reminding
 themselves they're only one in five!

307
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:31,602
There's only the two of us to help them!

308
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:35,520
- Alright, but you let me go first.
- Yes-yes, yes go-on.../

309
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:43,451
Ian look at this!

310
00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:45,069
Mm, yeah.

311
00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:48,098
What do you suppose it is, corn, wheat?

312
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:49,440
Wheat.

313
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:56,350
Still haven't thought of a way
of getting out of this place...

314
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:58,423
Oh yes, you're right it is wheat.

315
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:03,271
Ooh, it's all covered in some
sticky stuff, like toffee.

316
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:06,860
Hey Barbara, look at this...

317
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:09,532
Give me your handkerchief will you?

318
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:12,981
Do you see what this is? A
book of litmus papers, hah!

319
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:18,628
How often have I held a piece of
litmus paper in my fingers..? 

320
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:22,594
- Oh well, it's a handy seat.
- Yeah

321
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:26,235
You realise what this place is?

322
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,156
Ooh it's some sort of a laboratory.

323
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:32,903
Yes, I think it must explain
those dead insects and things. 

324
00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:34,603
They must be doing some experiments.

325
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:37,921
Course it makes it all
the more dangerous for us.

326
00:21:38,856 --> 00:21:39,842
Why do you say that?

327
00:21:39,877 --> 00:21:42,721
Well, whatever killed those
insects could easily kill us.

328
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:49,373
The Doctor said something
like that, I... I'd forgotten.

329
00:21:50,758 --> 00:21:52,400
Well don't touch anything, eh?

330
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:54,528
But...but...Ian...

331
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:58,925
I mean, look at the way these seeds
are coated. They're obviously samples.

332
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:04,532
Yes, I think they must be 
inventing a new insecticide 

333
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,832
and they've sprayed these seeds with it.

334
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:12,498
Oh surely I... I mean, couldn't
it be just preserving oil?

335
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:14,754
I doubt it, anyway,
you keep away from it.

336
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,340
I-AN!
BAR-BARA!

337
00:22:27,872 --> 00:22:30,261
There they are, can
you see them Barbara?

338
00:22:30,296 --> 00:22:32,738
Doctor, Susan we're up here!

339
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:34,297
- Hello up there!
- What uncanny good luck!

340
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,088
Oh ha-ha Grandfather, we've found them!

341
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:37,918
Yes, I know my dear, I know!

342
00:22:38,753 --> 00:22:40,889
Did they really climb up that sink pipe?

343
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:43,295
Yeah, they must have done. I
wonder if we can get down it?

344
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,483
Climb down the plug-chain, to us!

345
00:22:44,818 --> 00:22:46,545
Yes alright we will!

346
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:51,406
Here, it's about thirty feet or
thereabouts, do you think you can make it?

347
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:54,565
Yes, I'll make it somehow, it'll
be worth it to see them two again.

348
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,713
Alright, let me go first.

349
00:23:08,332 --> 00:23:10,085
You been over doing things.

350
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,786
Yes... Yes, I-I think I have.

351
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:17,612
I'll go and get you some
water it'll freshen you up, eh?

352
00:23:17,757 --> 00:23:18,808
Thank you

353
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:19,980
What are you doing?

354
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,611
- I want your handkerchief. I was going...
- No!

355
00:23:23,017 --> 00:23:24,144
What's the matter?

356
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,087
You can't have it, you mustn't touch it!

357
00:23:26,122 --> 00:23:27,287
Barbara!

358
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:29,796
No-one must touch...

359
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:32,498
Barbara!

360
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:43,926
There, it's the same aroma! Insecticide.
You didn't eat or drink anything?

361
00:23:44,274 --> 00:23:45,960
Well no, certainly not!

362
00:23:46,295 --> 00:23:49,407
Shes got insecticide on
her hands, she touched it.

363
00:23:49,442 --> 00:23:52,165
Well she never told me, 
I never saw her do this! I... 

364
00:23:53,758 --> 00:23:55,165
She did borrow my handkerchief.

365
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,546
Where were you then?

366
00:23:56,581 --> 00:23:58,393
By that pile of seeds.

367
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:01,427
Yes you sh, you see, she's got it on her hands!

368
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:03,850
And she rubbed it off on your handkerchief!

369
00:24:03,962 --> 00:24:05,487
Oh... Why didn't she tell us?!

370
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:08,439
You can help her, can't you Doctor?

371
00:24:09,445 --> 00:24:11,492
Grandfather we can
do something can't we?

372
00:24:14,434 --> 00:24:17,998
What happened? D-did I..?

373
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:19,279
You fainted, that's all.

374
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:23,806
The insecticide... Is
that why I feel like this?

375
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:27,204
Yes. You got some of it on your hands 
and you didn't us tell anything about it!

376
00:24:27,374 --> 00:24:29,374
It was very wrong of you, wasn't it?

377
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:30,467
Am I... Am I?

378
00:24:30,562 --> 00:24:34,055
No-no-no, no this little
attack...experience is only temporary.

379
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,183
Oh take it easy Barbara,

380
00:24:36,218 --> 00:24:37,556
Look out.

381
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:39,382
Come on Barbara take it easy

382
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:42,105
Well what can we do for her?

383
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,670
Well it's urgent that we get her back to normal size, 

384
00:24:45,823 --> 00:24:52,570
but, ah, at the moment her protective cells are too small 
to cope with the molecules of poison in her bloodstream.

385
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:58,952
But if we can, that dosage of insecticide 
will be seventy times less dangerous, 

386
00:24:59,187 --> 00:25:01,035
- practically nothing at all!
- Are you sure?

387
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,285
Yes I'm quite sure. But we
must get her back to the ship.

388
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,035
What are we waiting for?

389
00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:09,999
How are you feeling?

390
00:25:11,465 --> 00:25:15,333
Ooh..a bit ropey. Ooh, could
do with a glass of water.

391
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,788
We're going to take
you back to the ship.

392
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,995
Alright, just give me a minute.

393
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,847
Come on Barbara, we've
got a long way to go.

394
00:25:27,295 --> 00:25:29,163
You can get us back to normal size?

395
00:25:29,198 --> 00:25:33,308
Oho, yes! of course I can
dear boy, yes, course I can...

396
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:36,335
I hope.

397
00:25:38,777 --> 00:25:44,352
We've got to repeat exactly wha..the
things that happened to us when we landed.

398
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:46,354
Is there anything I can do?

399
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:49,577
Yes, that seed over there by the chair. Take it over to the table

400
00:25:49,732 --> 00:25:52,037
so that we can all see it. And wrap that round it when you do it.

401
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,794
Doctor!

402
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:25,594
Er!

403
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:26,630
Doctor I...

404
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:32,237
Shh-sh. I think it's working.
Splendid, I think it's working, my boy!

405
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:35,204
Doctor, look at that seed!

406
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:49,050
Yes yes, we've done it! Yes,
ha-ha ha-ha, we've done it, yes!

407
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:52,881
Doctor, it's incredible, that
seed, it's completely vanished!

408
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:57,319
No no my dear boy, no. Hah-ha!

409
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:04,435
Look, can you see, it
hasn't vanished at all!/

410
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:09,863
Grandfather,  is that the
seed you brought in with you?

411
00:27:09,898 --> 00:27:11,250
The same seed!

412
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,853
Then we are back to normal!

413
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:14,729
Completely my dear!

414
00:27:14,764 --> 00:27:19,717
Now before I check up and see where we are,
I suggest you all go and have a good scrub mm?

415
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:21,036
Oh please!

416
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:22,249
Go-on, off you go!

417
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:33,076
Oh dear-dear-dear-dear-dear,
now isn't that irritating mm?!

418
00:27:33,911 --> 00:27:38,429
I had to repair that wretched thing
and now look at it, I can't see a thing!

419
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:15,851
