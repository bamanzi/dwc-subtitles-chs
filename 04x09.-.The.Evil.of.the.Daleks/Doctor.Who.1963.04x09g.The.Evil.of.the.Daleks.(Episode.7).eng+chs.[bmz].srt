You will spread it to the entire history of Earth!
你要提取出"Dalek特质”, 并将它散布到地球的整个历史中去！

你是说, 他跟我们所有人作对, 就为了那个？

00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:30,781
JAMIE: Look, it's daft though. Metal into gold is an old wives tale.
哈, 还是觉得这样很蠢。金属变成金子是个老梗了

15
00:01:31,012 --> 00:01:36,314

made transmutation their main aim in life.
哦, 我也不知道。但中世纪的炼金术士把这作为了一生的终极目标

16
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:37,750

哦, 我是不在乎它是不是可能

20
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:47,770
DOCTOR: Whether it is or whether it isn't is beside the point.
可能还是不可能现在都不是关键了

21
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:49,001
JAMIE: Oh, and what is the point then?

You're trying to shake my faith. But I will be given the secret.
我知道你想干什么, 博士。你试图动摇我的信念, 但我很快会获得秘方了

26
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:04,895
JAMIE: Oh, well. It won't do you any good, because you won't
be able to use your secret! I'll see to that.
哦, 好啊, 它不会带给你什么好处的。因为你没机会用到你的秘方了, 我会确保这个的

27
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:06,035
MAXTIBLE: You'll do no such thing!
你不能干这种事！

28

给你们一个建议：它们怎么说你们就怎么做

34
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:24,516

噢, 别担心。一想到要靠近你, 我就恶心了

35
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:25,819

不, 我跟你说了, 不行！

42
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:04,191
VICTORIA: It's no good, Papa. He doesn't listen any more.
这样没用的, 爸爸。他再也听不进去了

43
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,136
VICTORIA: What are you thinking?

VICTORIA: I see.

we still couldn't go back to Earth.
就算我能相信这些 Dalek, 就算它们能放我们走, 我们还是没法回到地球

53

I might even try and take you to my own planet.
我想我还是把你们都带到另外一个宇宙吧, 或者试试带你们到我自己的星球去

MAXTIBLE: What of it? It was erratic. I always warned the Daleks
it would prove too unsatisfactory.
那怎么了, 那东西并不太可靠, 我一直跟 Dalek 说这东西只会带来不满意

58
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,359

They'd have tried it on you next.
