1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:37,855
The humans have been told to begin the test.

3
00:00:38,147 --> 00:00:41,371
Any delay will result in death.

4
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:43,776
There will be no delay!

5
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:52,301
Mollie, Mollie. Mr. McCrimmon has been kidnapped! It means the end of us unless we can find him quickly.

6
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:53,749
Straw.

7
00:00:54,093 --> 00:00:55,258
I beg your pardon?

8
00:00:55,544 --> 00:00:56,506
A piece of straw.

9
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:05,399
Had a cosy little sleep, young swell?

10
00:01:07,563 --> 00:01:12,951
Lively, is it? Maybe you'd like to sleep again? I've got Mr. Nod here.

11
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:14,989
He'll have you snorin' as good as ever.

12
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:16,401
What do you want?

13
00:01:16,734 --> 00:01:19,100
I'm to be well paid. Have no fear of that.

14
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,441
Oh, and for what? I don't know you.

15
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:25,848
This your man, sir?

16
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:28,296
Toby! What in Hades have you done?

17
00:01:29,282 --> 00:01:31,899
Why, I, uh... brought 'im from the house, like you said.

18
00:01:32,104 --> 00:01:33,369
I said nothing of the kind.

19
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:42,440
Well ya did, sir! Honest ya did. A guinea ya promised me. I... I done what ya said. You don't get outta payin'.

20
00:01:42,664 --> 00:01:44,238
Be careful how you speak to me, Toby!

21
00:01:46,665 --> 00:01:48,927
There's your money. Get out!

22
00:02:08,384 --> 00:02:09,723
Where's Toby?

23
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:13,339
You just sent him about his business. Look, what's the matter? Are you all right?

24
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,834
Where's Victoria Waterfield?

25
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:16,655
I don't know.

26
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:18,093
Yes, you do.

27
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:19,615
I tell you, I don't even know her!

28
00:02:20,678 --> 00:02:23,726
You're in the house, a friend of Maxtible's. You must know!

29
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:25,855
No, listen, I'm te...

30
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:38,599
Ha, I must apologize for that villain Toby. He was telling lies, of course. I shall escort you to the house.

31
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:40,857
Uh, You... you... you just asked me about Victoria Waterfield.

32
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:45,779
Now, she's in Paris. I'm afraid I haven't introduced myself - Arthur Terrall.

33
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:50,451
Well, never mind about that. Did you or did you not ask that man to knock me on the head and bring me in here?

34
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:51,322
I, oh...

35
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:52,510
...certainly not!

36
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:53,237
Oh.

37
00:02:53,893 --> 00:03:00,236
Doctor, oh. I see you're in good hands now. I won't detain you any further. Good day, Doctor.

38
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:01,599
Oh, good day to you.

39
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,521
He's mad. Stark, staring mad!

40
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,399
Yes, I know. I was listening. Let's have a look at that head of yours. Come along.

41
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:23,999
Look, it's all right, Doctor. One minute he says this, the next minute he says that. Can you make it out, Doctor? I'm knocked on the head and I'm brought in here. Then that man Terrall enters and denies having ordered the other man to do it. Well, then he changes, and starts asking about Victoria Waterfield and in the next breath, he tells me she's in Paris!

42
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,080
I know what's happened to Victoria.

43
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:27,041
What has?

44
00:03:27,315 --> 00:03:29,131
She's a prisoner of the Daleks.

45
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:33,339
Hurry!

46
00:03:35,337 --> 00:03:45,662
Why am I being moved? Are you taking me back to my father?

47
00:03:45,846 --> 00:04:05,506
No, you are being moved. Pick up your cover. Follow. Do not be afraid.

48
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:08,475
You are not to be exterminated.

49
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:20,975
Do not delay.

50
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:42,938
Move.

51
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:54,051
You've warned him - told him about the Daleks?

52
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:54,878
Yes, of course I did!

53
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:56,182
But you were expressly told...

54
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,265
Oh, fiddlesticks!

55
00:04:57,628 --> 00:05:01,354
Bosh! Jamie will cooperate. You may be certain of that.

56
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:02,656
Are you sure?

57
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:09,667
Yes, perfectly sure. Jamie will do everything he is asked to do. Now come along, we must go and find Maxtible.

58
00:05:32,628 --> 00:05:37,006
The female human being has been moved.

59
00:05:37,264 --> 00:05:39,330
Everything is prepared.

60
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,560
The testing equipment is ready?

61
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:48,737
I think you will be pleased with the man I've had specially brought from London. Ah, he works in my house.

62
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:50,002
Show me!

63
00:05:54,225 --> 00:06:11,053
You will understand that he is rather simple. He's quite dumb, but, uh... that has its advantages for us. His mind is, how shall I say, undeveloped. He will not understand you, the Daleks. Uh, I mean he will be terrified of you.

64
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:12,045
Show me.

65
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:13,739
Ohh, I beg your pardon, uh...

66
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:22,170
Kemel!

67
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:45,677
Will you come with me? I want you to stand here. No, no, no, no, no, face the cabinet. Good.

68
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:53,294
Now, bend that.

69
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:46,117
Excellent Kemel, excellent. Now, you'll help me with these stools.

70
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:07,870
Now, Kemel. One blow. Break the plank!

71
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:23,536
Very good Kemel. I'm very pleased with you. Now you can put on your jacket.

72
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:35,352
Come over here. Now, I want you to listen carefully. See this man?

73
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:55,742
Now, I'm going to take you to a place that I want you to guard, and this young man will try and get past you and you are not to let him. Do you understand? Oh, he's an evil villain, Kemel, a cutthroat who would gladly murder us all in our beds, if he could. You will remember this man, hmm?

74
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,346
Right. Well, you come with me and I will direct you.

75
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:43,265
You wait here. This is the entrance to the south wing of my house, and through here will pass the man I showed you in the picture. The door itself is an obstacle.

76
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,215
No, no, wait!

77
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:17,671
Now, if he gets through here, you will deal with him. Go now.

78
00:10:28,307 --> 00:10:30,655
We do not trust you.

79
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:31,960
Then we're quits, aren't we?

80
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:34,404
But we have your time machine.

81
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,369
Yes.

82
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,123
So, you will obey us.

83
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:45,766
They want the "Human Factor", is that right?

84
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:47,457
Yes, that is what they want.

85
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:55,417
Very complex. And you want to introduce this "human factor" into the race of Daleks?

86
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:03,441
Yes, the conquest of humanity has eluded us. The Daleks must know why.

87
00:11:03,656 --> 00:11:05,624
But, why choose Jamie for this test?

88
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:08,926
His travelling with you makes him unique.

89
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,284
But why him? Why not me?

90
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,368
Request denied.

91
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,226
Why?

92
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:17,401
You have travelled too much through time. You are more than human.

93
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:19,338
I see.

94
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,772
What is this?

95
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,682
They have been brought from the Dalek planet.

96
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,917
Skaro!

97
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:34,026
Yes, their life force is dormant. Before it is activated, we want...

98
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:38,042
You want the "human factor" introduced. I see.

99
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:39,517
You will obey us!

100
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:40,716
I will make up my own mind!

101
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:44,479
Do not antagonize them, Doctor. They will destroy your time machine!

102
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:50,904
And if I agree, it means the creation of a race of super-Daleks!

103
00:11:55,814 --> 00:12:01,725
My TARDIS... I have no choice, do I? Very well. I agree.

104
00:12:02,002 --> 00:12:07,162
The human being with you must not be aware of the trial.

105
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:08,670
I quite understand.

106
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,616
Make him begin the test!

107
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,884
What must Jamie do?

108
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:28,295
Attempt to rescue Waterfield's daughter.

109
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:37,656
There we are, sir.

110
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:38,826
Thank you, Mollie.

111
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:41,095
Arthur, I'd like you to meet Mr. McCrimmon.

112
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:43,932
May I ask what you are doing in this house?

113
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,841
I was just about to ask you the same thing.

114
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:48,396
Oh, you gentlemen have been introduced?

115
00:12:48,576 --> 00:12:49,701
Aye, we've met.

116
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:53,896
It seems, Ruth, your father has the oddest collection of house guests these days.

117
00:12:54,864 --> 00:12:56,568
Now Arthur, please!

118
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:58,919
You must forgive him, Mr. McCrimmon.

119
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,369
Ah, it's becoming a habit.

120
00:13:00,617 --> 00:13:01,892
I don't care for insolence.

121
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:03,985
Well, I'm not keen on arrogance myself!

122
00:13:04,303 --> 00:13:06,962
Why, you bite at each other as if you were old enemies!

123
00:13:07,497 --> 00:13:09,064
I'm sorry if I seem rude.

124
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:13,678
Come, I want you to be friends. Won't you be so, to please me?

125
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:24,039
Arthur... Arthur, what is it? Excuse me. Arthur! What's the matter?

126
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:32,648
Sir?

127
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,133
Yes?! Oh, I wish you'd call me Jamie.

128
00:13:36,343 --> 00:13:38,699
Oh, I couldn't do that sir. What would the master say?

129
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,860
Oh, who cares! Ah, What can I do for you?

130
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:46,606
If you'd tell me where your bags are, sir - yours and the Doctor's - I'll have them taken up to your room.

131
00:13:46,844 --> 00:13:48,089
Aye. well, Mollie...

132
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:52,105
Listen to me, "have them taken. " I dare say I'll be doin' it meself!

133
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:54,927
You see, we didn't have time to pick up the luggage. It'll be following.

134
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:55,818
Oh.

135
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,930
Why do you say that you'll be doing it yourself?

136
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:05,247
Well, they do say, sir, that the house is haunted. Mr. Kitson, the butler, left, and cook and the two footmen are complainin' again.

137
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:06,111
Haunted?

138
00:14:06,331 --> 00:14:10,617
Mmm. But, I've never heard anything sir. I sleep like a log and always have.

139
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,988
Aye. well, I'm glad you've got over the fright you had.

140
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:23,723
Oh, yes, that horrible man. Miss Ruth said it was all a game, but I dunno sir. I've never fainted before, sir. Truly I haven't.

141
00:14:23,926 --> 00:14:25,985
Not "sir", "Jamie"!

142
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:28,879
Tell me about Arthur Terrall.

143
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:30,524
Miss Ruth's fiancé, sir?

144
00:14:30,758 --> 00:14:31,488
Aye.

145
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:35,168
Oh, oh, he's a kind man, sir. Usually.

146
00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:36,269
Usually?

147
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:43,933
Mmm. Well, when he's a bit odd or his temper's up, as it has been lately, I says to meself "Inkerman" and then it's all right.

148
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:44,851
"Inkerman"?

149
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:56,094
Yes sir. 'e was out in the Crimea, 'e was. They do say Mr. Terrall was wounded out there. Do you know, my uncle was killed at Inkerman, sir. So, you see, I do know what it's like with soldiers.

150
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:06,628
Oh... oh, I'm sorry sir. I didn't mean to... Well cook said to me that if I did some dusting it would be all right. Oh, you won't tell the master, will you? That I... Ah, ah... Thank you. Sorry sir.

151
00:15:06,808 --> 00:15:14,827
Sorry Mollie. Never mind, Mollie. That will do. Yes, Mollie, thank you very much. It's all right, Mollie. I wouldn't dream of telling him. Thank you very much, Bye-bye.

152
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:19,683
Hmm, you'll have to brush up on your history. I can't be around to cover up for you all the time.

153
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:25,263
Now then, in the Crimean War, the English, the French and the Turks fought the Russians...

154
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,662
Oh, forget about all that!

155
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:32,440
Oh, I thought you'd be interested. I watched the Charge of the Light Brigade. Magnificent folly...

156
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,893
Look, where've you been?

157
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:34,979
Oh, just looking around.

158
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:36,135
Aye. What for? The TARDIS?!

159
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:39,420
Jamie, you're in a temper!

160
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,541
Oh, am I? Is that bad then? Does that mean I won't be co-operative - I won't do everything I'm told?

161
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,673
What was that?

162
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:47,060
I overheard you and Waterfield!

163
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:48,208
You were eavesdropping!

164
00:15:48,342 --> 00:15:49,526
Well, whatever it is, I don't like what you're doing.

165
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:50,424
Now you listen to me...!

166
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:56,244
No, Doctor, you're forgetting the TARDIS was stolen and a man was murdered! Now, how am I supposed to tell when I see you as friendly as you like with the murderer!

167
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:58,522
Waterfield did not murder that man!

168
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:01,342
All right then, but he stole the TARDIS and that still makes him a thief!

169
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:02,577
The Daleks forced him to!

170
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,772
The Daleks! You keep telling me about the Daleks, and I haven't even seen one! You're always on about them, but where are they?!

171
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:07,552
Now you listen to me...!

172
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:14,521
No, you'll not get round me this time, Doctor. You're up to something with Waterfield and Maxtible. Now what is it? Some scientific invention?!

173
00:16:15,065 --> 00:16:16,360
Oh, here's your friend.

174
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:17,504
Just a little argument.

175
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,254
I heard voices raised.

176
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:20,641
That's not all you'll hear!

177
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:23,141
Jamie seems to think that I'm lying to him.

178
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:24,118
Well, aren't you?!

179
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:25,621
He doesn't believe the Daleks are here.

180
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:26,621
It's the truth.

181
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,094
Aye, the truth you told Arthur Terrall, maybe - that your daughter was in Paris!

182
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:31,445
I had to tell him that.

183
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,125
So, you've got another story to tell me?

184
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:38,202
I tell you that the Daleks are holding my daughter prisoner in the south wing of this house, Mr. McCrimmon.

185
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:41,101
Then why don't you try and get her back, eh?! What are you doing?!

186
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:48,104
Well, what can I do? Now, be... be fair Jamie. Waterfield's tied hand and foot because of his daughter and we're tied hand and foot because of the TARDIS!

187
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:53,801
Aye, and that's all you can think about, isn't it? The TARDIS. Well, you can all stand around doing nothing. I'm sick to death of it!

188
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:54,948
Now just where are you going?

189
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:57,449
To be by myself for a bit. Do you mind?

190
00:16:57,594 --> 00:17:07,828
No, not a bit. But, one word of warning. Don't you try to be a one-man army. You leave well alone. I won't have you ruining everything trying to rescue Victoria Waterfield. Now, you understand?!

191
00:17:11,815 --> 00:17:15,221
Well, are you sure you didn't go a little too far, Doctor?

192
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:22,170
Adding a little fuel to the fire. Tell Maxtible that I'll be along to his laboratory shortly.

193
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:23,495
Oh, very well, Doctor. If you're sure.

194
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:31,161
Oh yes, quite sure. Once our young friend has cooled his heels a bit, he'll launch off on his own. And you dropped the hint about the south wing beautifully.

195
00:17:39,096 --> 00:17:45,306
Well, what is it? You wanted to see me?

196
00:17:47,006 --> 00:17:48,482
Very good of you to talk to me, gov'nor.

197
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,248
Well, never mind all that. I'll give you two minutes, no more.

198
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:53,174
I want me rights. No more, no less.

199
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,946
What do you mean, "rights"?

200
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:57,325
'alf a guinea, you gave me, and it ain't what we said.

201
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,537
You were lucky to get anything.

202
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:01,009
That ain't fair!

203
00:18:01,217 --> 00:18:07,623
You'll get no more from me. I warn you! Keep away from this house, and this property. Find the nearest road to London and take it!

204
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:13,778
Oh, yeah, London, sir. Yeah, I daresay I could earn something for me stories there.

205
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,774
Stories?

206
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:19,728
Oh, I won't detain an important gentleman like yourself. Like as not me two minutes is up anyway.

207
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:20,994
What do you mean, "stories"?

208
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:22,849
Ah, it's all right, sir. I'll take a stroll to London...

209
00:18:22,989 --> 00:18:24,524
Don't play with me!

210
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:30,434
Get off me! If you must know, there's plenty who'd pay to hear what I've got to tell 'em.

211
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,460
Indeed.

212
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:36,731
Yeah. You blows too hot and cold for me - tellin' me this one minute and that the next, and not payin' up.

213
00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:37,843
You know nothing.

214
00:18:37,996 --> 00:18:39,816
Don't I though?

215
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,796
Hmm. Who'd believe you anyway?

216
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:43,222
Pay me off, and there's the end of it!

217
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:46,335
Oh, blackmail is it?! Get out!

218
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:19,185
Maybe I don't know much to tell, but I'll wager I'll find something in the house that's worth me trouble. So, I'll say thank ya, Mr. Terrall, sir!

219
00:19:51,376 --> 00:19:52,958
It's only me, Mollie!

220
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:57,557
It's over here, sir. I took it from the master's study.

221
00:19:57,748 --> 00:19:59,409
It's marvellous. Thank you!

222
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:02,440
'ere, is this what you wanted?

223
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:09,913
Perfect, yes. Let's see, umm... this is the south wing here?

224
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:11,844
Yes sir, but it's been closed off.

225
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:12,804
Completely?

226
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:17,894
Oh, no sir. Only 'cause of some repairs about a twelve-month back. But the door may be locked.

227
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:18,980
Can you show me?

228
00:20:19,242 --> 00:20:26,000
All right. What're you gonna do, sir?

229
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:28,395
Off to hunt a few wee ghosties, Mollie.

230
00:20:31,036 --> 00:20:37,637
Every single one of Jamie's reactions will be recorded on these Dalek machines?

231
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:43,435
And then transformed into thought patterns on silver wire. A wonderful creation!

232
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:50,539
It is for you, Doctor, to select the major feelings to make up this "human factor".

233
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,924
Oh, yes. I quite understand.

234
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,390
We can rely on the Doctor to give us all cooperation.

235
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:58,227
We shall watch your every move.

236
00:20:58,554 --> 00:21:03,824
I'm sure you will. And every step of Jamie's progress will be covered?

237
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:05,203
Yes.

238
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:10,531
The young human being is on his way.

239
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,771
Then the recording machines can be set in action.

240
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:23,402
Here!

241
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:29,863
Yes, sir. I once remember the master stepping away from here. When he saw me, he was very cross and told me to keep away.

242
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:30,878
I see.

243
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:16,939
What was that? What was that?!

244
00:22:17,188 --> 00:22:20,216
That was no ghost, Mollie, that's for sure. That was a human voice!

245
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,477
Oh, sir!

246
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:24,747
Look Mollie, take the candle and go back to your room. Will you do that?

247
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:25,474
Yes sir.

248
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:26,661
Now, do you want me to see you safely there?

249
00:22:26,826 --> 00:22:28,568
No, no. I'll be all right.

250
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:03,439
Hello. Who are you?
