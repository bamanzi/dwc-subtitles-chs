1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:09,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,356
Hello? Who are you?

3
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:20,282
It took courage to fight Maxtible's Turkish wrestler.

4
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:26,057
The Daleks are afraid of nothing and no one.

5
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:29,102
But Jamie saved the Turk's life.

6
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,208
Human weakness.

7
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:41,282
If he hadn't, he would have died in that room of yours. If you want the Human Factor, a part of it must include mercy.

8
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,909
What... what is he doing here?

9
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:56,877
A common thief, come to see what he could steal. No mystery here.

10
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:03,987
The intruder was destroyed.

11
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:08,747
Well, what... what are we to do? Where is the Doctor? He must be told.

12
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:09,544
No.

13
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:10,468
Why not?

14
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:11,675
Obey me!

15
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:16,816
Waterfield, I... I... I beg of you, do not antagonize the, um... hmm...

16
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,817
...our friends.

17
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:23,170
Oh, why do you consistently avoid reality, Maxtible? Another man has died. Can't you grasp that fact?

18
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:27,933
You will hide the remains of the dead human intruder.

19
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:29,175
No!

20
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:30,639
That is an order!

21
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:33,660
We must do as they say, Waterfield. We... we... we cannot anger them.

22
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:37,314
Here. Wrap the body in this.

23
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,268
No.

24
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,962
We must! Have you lost your mind? Don't you want to see your daughter again?

25
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:52,472
Th... there's no end to this. The hands of the Devil.

26
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:56,923
Dispose of the body. Obey!

27
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:12,368
Waterfield, what is the matter with you? We are not to blame for everything that has happened. No English judge or jury would find it in their hearts to convict us of one solitary thing.

28
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:15,092
It will never come to that.

29
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,460
And what may that remark mean?

30
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:31,930
I have one purpose only: to see my daughter out of the hands of those foul monsters. When that is achieved, I shall confess my part in all that has happened.

31
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,709
Y... You must help me.

32
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:56,460
I am at your heels, my dear sir.

33
00:08:00,776 --> 00:08:15,851
That's better, thank you. Aye, you're an odd one. I'll say that. Aye, well, I... I suppose we're both a a bit touched, eh? Knocking each other about the place and saving one another's lives.

34
00:08:18,844 --> 00:08:20,465
You don't say much, do you?

35
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:31,403
Oh, I see. You can't talk? Aye. Well, you're a sight better than a number of people I know who can. I wonder what your name is?

36
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,985
Kemel? Well, I'm Jamie.

37
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:51,807
He... hey, what is that?! Now come on now. None of that. We're to be friends. Do you hear? Friends.

38
00:08:56,572 --> 00:08:57,597
Aye.

39
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:07,243
"V.W." I know, Victoria Waterfield.

40
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:28,295
Oh, Miss Waterfield gave you the flower? You like her?

41
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:32,918
Of course. Then what are we fighting for?

42
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,820
Do you not know what I'm doing here, Kemel? Victoria Waterfield is being held a prisoner here somewhere.

43
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:58,358
Together? Aye, we'll go together. There's no one I'd rather have with me.

44
00:10:19,448 --> 00:10:22,265
What was that? Did you hear it?

45
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:23,911
Control your nerves.

46
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,475
But there was a noise.

47
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:30,514
Waterfield, go back to the house.

48
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:35,293
Hmm? Oh, we have a task to perform.

49
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:38,782
Waterfield, I am sick to death of you.

50
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:41,229
What?

51
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,813
I take you into my house, you and your daughter - provide for you.

52
00:10:45,034 --> 00:10:47,333
Yes, I know everything that you've done.

53
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:55,137
Small thanks do I get for it! I did not bring these terrible creatures here deliberately, you know that. Am I to blame for everything?

54
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,869
No, no.

55
00:10:57,127 --> 00:11:02,455
No, it is your daughter they have kidnapped. One moment, you beg me to do everything I can to rescue her; next moment, you blame me.

56
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:15,415
Yes. I... I don't mean it like that. It's the price. First Kennedy, now this fellow. How many people must die so that my daughter can live?

57
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,407
We are not the murderers!

58
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:26,088
No, just the silent partners. But we're equally to blame because we stand by and do nothing.

59
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:34,243
Go back to the house, Waterfield. I... I understand you are under a stress. You... you try and get some sleep.

60
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:38,916
Sleep? I've not had one good night's rest since this started.

61
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:45,474
There. You go back to your room. Near the end now. You've done enough.

62
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:51,527
What... what are you doing?

63
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:52,863
Waterfield does not die yet!

64
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:54,761
He says he will confess everything!

65
00:11:57,732 --> 00:12:05,236
Go back to the laboratory. I will dispose of the body. You will obey. You will obey!

66
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:24,645
Wait. Never mind about those, Kemel, unless they catch sight of us. We seem to be going in the right direction.

67
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:00,272
Down!

68
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:49,017
We do not trust you. What thoughts are you using now?

69
00:13:49,482 --> 00:14:03,191
Human beings have five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. But there is instinct too. And Jamie used instinct to avoid your trap.

70
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:39,464
Name?

71
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:41,236
Victoria.

72
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,155
Louder.

73
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:49,329
Victoria! Victoria Waterfield! You know my name!

74
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:58,141
Silence. Inspection is over. Return to your room.

75
00:15:04,865 --> 00:15:06,615
She's very beautiful, Kemel.

76
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:22,462
What are you going to do with that?

77
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:45,680
You'll attack the Daleks - draw them off down the corridor, while I go up there and rescue her somehow? It's too dangerous, Kemel. Besides, needs two of us up there. But how?

78
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:52,092
What is the significance of this thought pattern?

79
00:15:53,008 --> 00:16:12,268
Suicidal attacks to gain an objective. Postulate. Self-preservation is a strong human factor. Jamie and his new friend are determined to succeed. But finding the girl is only part. Getting her away is another.

80
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:20,163
You'll come in here, Mollie, and explain yourself.

81
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:22,931
Oh... Oh, sir... Please, sir... You're hurting me!

82
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:25,858
Now, what is this hysterical nonsense?

83
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:28,775
But sir, I heard Miss Victoria's voice!

84
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:32,207
Did she say how the weather was in Paris? That's where she is, Mollie.

85
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:34,998
Well, I know that sir, but I heard her speaking.

86
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:35,924
Where?

87
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:41,426
I was walking past the big fireplace in the hall sir, and her voice sort of... floated out of it.

88
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,689
Will you explain how you could possibly hear Miss Waterfield's voice when she's in Paris?!

89
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:48,214
I know it can't be, sir, but I heard her, as plain as anything.

90
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:49,899
What were you doing in the hall?

91
00:16:50,106 --> 00:16:51,292
Oh, well. I wasn't doing anything wrong, sir.

92
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:52,723
What were you doing in this part of the house at this hour?!

93
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:53,564
Oh, I don't know.

94
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:54,864
You do know, and you'll tell me!

95
00:16:55,054 --> 00:16:56,326
Arthur!

96
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,319
I found this child creeping about the corridors.

97
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:02,376
I haven't done anything.

98
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:03,287
Be quiet!

99
00:17:03,765 --> 00:17:04,255
Yes sir.

100
00:17:04,462 --> 00:17:06,438
She's miles from her room - should have been in bed an hour since!

101
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:07,980
Did you have extra work this morning?

102
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:09,140
Yes, Miss Ruth. I do.

103
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:10,246
You're a liar!

104
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,471
Well, I haven't done anything, Miss. I haven't took nothing.

105
00:17:14,671 --> 00:17:17,824
Arthur, the poor child's frightened out of her skin after this.

106
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:20,834
She's nothing but play acting. She's a mean, sniveling little minx.

107
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:22,270
But I haven't done anything. I haven't.

108
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,373
Go to the sitting room and wait there. Mr. Maxtible will decide what to do with you.

109
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,147
But sir, I...

110
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:27,454
Do as you are told!

111
00:17:28,918 --> 00:17:33,051
Mollie, it's all right. Everything will be all right.

112
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:40,052
Arthur, tell me what's wrong.

113
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:42,513
Wrong? Why should something be wrong?

114
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:46,592
Has my father influenced you in some way?

115
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:50,211
No, not your father.

116
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:57,062
Come away with me please! I somehow feel if we delay, it will be too late.

117
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:03,540
I can't go. Not yet.

118
00:18:04,739 --> 00:18:22,327
I have done everything you have asked me to. You wanted an agency here on Earth to plan and prepare things for you. I have been that agency. Will you please tell those who give you orders that I am getting tired of waiting.

119
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:25,312
Do you threaten the Daleks?

120
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,625
Oh, surely threatening is not necessary. We have a... a partnership - an understanding.

121
00:18:30,948 --> 00:18:33,232
You have obeyed us.

122
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:52,492
You have a strange way of putting things. I prefer to say that you have asked for certain services. I have, uh... provided those services punctually and efficiently. Now you really must look to your side of the bargain. It is not beyond me to ruin the entire enterprise.

123
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:55,021
Oh, oh, oh, ho!

124
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:58,405
Do not threaten! Obey!

125
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:01,438
Yes, very well! I understand!

126
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,653
Obey the Daleks.

127
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:09,776
No. Please... Please wait!

128
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:18,884
The secret... the secret. You promised to give it to me! That is why I have done all this!

129
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:25,935
The Daleks know many secrets. You will learn the most important.

130
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:48,451
I must not be frightened of them. It's just their way. Th... They're different people - alien. But they will tell me! Of course they will!

131
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:50,397
Father!

132
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:52,626
Ruth, I told you not to come in here - under any circumstances.

133
00:19:52,951 --> 00:20:01,102
Father, I simply had to. I heard you speaking to someone and there's no one here. And Arthur is involved in some way.

134
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:03,326
Oh, Arthur. Yes.

135
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:10,063
Why has he become so changed? And Victoria Waterfield - where is she?

136
00:20:11,256 --> 00:20:28,645
My child, these are questions that I cannot answer. But, my dear, I will tell you one thing - one thing only, and then perhaps you may understand why there are secrets to be kept.

137
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:33,626
You see this?

138
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:34,623
What is it?

139
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:38,653
A piece of ordinary metal of very little value, would you not say so?

140
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:39,787
I suppose so.

141
00:20:40,047 --> 00:21:00,963
What does it weigh? A few pounds? Five, six, shall we say? For centuries now, men have searched for the greatest secret of all. Some say it was known to the ancient alchemists. Some say that the secret never existed at all. But still, the stories and the rumours, and the search goes on!

142
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:02,441
What secret?!

143
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:27,169
The transmutation of metal into gold. Changing metal into gold. Now, perhaps, do you begin to understand a little? To possess such a secret would mean power and influence beyond all imagination. And I am about to discover this secret. Nothing will stop me. Nothing! Nobody!

144
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:36,824
Name?

145
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:38,694
Victoria.

146
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:40,370
Louder!

147
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:42,823
Victoria Waterfield!

148
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:44,530
Victoria Waterfield!

149
00:21:45,896 --> 00:21:51,907
Inspection is over. Return to your room.

150
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,604
