1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:37,378
It's a game, Jamie! They're playing a game!

3
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:42,101
A rather amusing little game, don't you think so Jamie.

4
00:00:43,016 --> 00:00:51,862
We've done it! Maxtible, they've got the "Human Factor". We've done it! What are they doing now? Look, they're all joining in. They're playing train!

5
00:00:53,954 --> 00:01:00,289
Train, train, train, train.

6
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:12,476
Oh... oh, now what is it? Oh, we're on the roundabout. They're playing roundabout. Oh, I'm getting dizzy. Oh dear. Oh, oh, ho, ho, oh. I'm dizzy! Oh, ho, ho. I'm dizzy.

7
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:19,012
Diz-yy, diz-yy, dizzy Doctor.

8
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:22,197
Maxtible, do you hear that? They've got a sense of humour!

9
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,638
I'm glad you are so easily amused.

10
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,743
Well, I congratulate you, Doctor. They are almost human.

11
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:29,752
They are!

12
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:32,752
And I will now leave you to your little game.

13
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,271
Oh, thank you.

14
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:37,136
Well, how old are they now, Doctor - mentally?

15
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:47,799
Oh, they're just young children, but they'll grow up very fast - within a matter of hours. Now, uh... come here all of you. Come along, gather round. Come here. Now then, come along, come along.

16
00:01:48,427 --> 00:01:51,328
Who is this?

17
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:55,292
Oh, this is Jamie. He's a friend.

18
00:01:55,933 --> 00:02:01,365
Friend. Hello, friend.

19
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:03,145
Well, say hello Jamie.

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,179
Hello.

21
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:10,759
You know what a friend is, don't you? It's somebody who... who likes you - who wants to help you and share with you.

22
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:12,197
There we are.

23
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,315
What have you done?

24
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:22,344
I have given you all names. Alpha, Beta and Omega.

25
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:34,453
Alpha, Beta, Omega. Alpha, Beta, Omega. Alpha, Beta, Omega.

26
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:40,810
Yes, yes, yes. now... now, this is Jamie and I am Doctor. We are friends.

27
00:02:41,348 --> 00:03:00,766
Friends, friends, Jamie, Doctor, friends, friends. We must go now. We are called.

28
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:06,942
Go? Go where? What do you mean, "go"?

29
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:12,490
All Daleks are ordered to return to Skaro.

30
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:15,922
Return to Skaro? But, that's the Dalek planet.

31
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:17,922
Friend.

32
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,085
But if the Daleks are returning to Skaro, where's Victoria?

33
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:28,073
Victoria! We left her in the secret passage. Come on - follow me!

34
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,658
I assure you, my dear Waterfield, Victoria is perfectly safe.

35
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,267
But where is she?

36
00:03:39,478 --> 00:03:40,988
The Daleks have released her.

37
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:42,591
Released?

38
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:44,190
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

39
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,629
Well, then, where is she?

40
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:49,861
She's probably lying down. Ruth will be taking care of her. You may be sure of that.

41
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:55,039
Not Ruth, no. I saw her and Mollie helping Arthur Terrall into a dog-cart not half an hour since.

42
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,564
Ruth and Terrall?

43
00:03:56,763 --> 00:04:00,695
Yes. Surely you knew they were leaving?

44
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:14,360
Oh, yes, yes, indeed, yes. It, it slipped my memory. Umm... As you see, I'm going for a little trip myself. I... No doubt, I shall join them. Well, possibly she's, ah... taking a stroll in the garden. Go along and see. Go along and see.

45
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:15,293
Yes

46
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:20,586
Well, go along man! Go along and see. Find your Victoria.

47
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,929
Stupid, stupid girl.

48
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,578
What are you doing?

49
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:57,382
Merely, ah... looking.

50
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,598
Do not touch the instrument.

51
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:01,468
What is that box for?

52
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:05,145
Do not question. You have your orders.

53
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:10,965
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. To... To bring the Doctor and his companion to you here for our little trip.

54
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:11,951
Yes

55
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:15,114
And then... The secret - you will give it to me?

56
00:05:15,563 --> 00:05:16,399
Yes.

57
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,598
The formula - the transmutation formula.

58
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:25,489
Yes. Obey your order. Do not delay.

59
00:05:50,846 --> 00:06:01,847
Doctor, Doctor! Doctor!

60
00:06:02,123 --> 00:06:11,638
Oh, Waterfield, how I'm delighted you've come back. Now will you please go and find the Doctor and his companion Jamie and bring them here to me? It is a matter of some urgency.

61
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:13,137
Maxtible?

62
00:06:13,364 --> 00:06:14,286
Oh, what is it?

63
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:16,598
What have you "arranged" with the Daleks?

64
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:18,133
The Daleks; nothing.

65
00:06:18,307 --> 00:06:20,151
What formula did they promise you?

66
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,784
No formula whatever.

67
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,081
What are you doing? You've sold yourself to them, haven't you?

68
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,445
You fool!

69
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:34,323
Yes, I'm a fool - a fool not to have realised before that it was you who brought this misery down on us.

70
00:06:34,585 --> 00:06:50,203
You, you never did understand anything, did you? Well, metal into gold. That's what the Daleks are going to give me. Now do you begin to understand? The secret of the transmutation of metal into gold.

71
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:53,584
Do you imagine I care about that?! Where is Victoria?

72
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:54,944
I've not the remotest idea.

73
00:06:55,158 --> 00:06:57,060
Yes, you have, and you're going to tell me!

74
00:06:57,237 --> 00:07:08,542
Get your hands off my throat. Let go of me! Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! Oh.

75
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:15,041
Oh, what are you doing?

76
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,405
Where is the Doctor?

77
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:17,980
Well, I had no time to bring him.

78
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,103
Hurry. That is an order.

79
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:22,297
What is that box for? Will you tell me?

80
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:24,906
We are destroying this area.

81
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:29,911
But you can't do that. Turn it off! You cannot destroy my house!

82
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:32,891
Bring the Doctor. Obey! Immediately!

83
00:07:33,100 --> 00:08:09,714
But, uh... the secret. If you destroy my laboratory, the secret is useless! You promised me. They must be out of their minds! Destroy my laboratory? the very idea. Well, well. But, oh, goodness gracious me, only two minutes. Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor. Oh, you fool.

84
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:31,985
All Daleks return to Skaro.

85
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:43,000
All Daleks return to Skaro.

86
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:44,433
And the prisoners?

87
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:46,504
They are already in transit.

88
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:52,627
Doc... Dalek... Doctor.

89
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:54,996
Waterfield, what's happened to you?

90
00:08:55,234 --> 00:09:02,558
Doc... Doctor, Daleks are going to destroy... house. Can't turn it off.

91
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:04,302
But, this is a time switch.

92
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,128
Well, if you can't turn it off, surely...

93
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:11,637
No, wait a minute. Eighty-nine, eighty-eight, eighty-seven. Just about a minute, that's all we've got.

94
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:12,863
Well, toss it out the window then.

95
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:19,894
This isn't a firework. We'd have to toss this half a mile. We'll have to follow the Daleks to Skaro. Jamie, open the doors. Come along.

96
00:09:20,203 --> 00:09:22,130
Doctor, Doctor.

97
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:23,711
Doctor, they're locked. They won't budge!

98
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,198
Cupboard in the alcove. The time machine.

99
00:09:27,403 --> 00:09:35,365
Time machine! Jamie, give me a hand. Come on. Quickly. Quickly. Here, now... Here, take this.

100
00:09:37,037 --> 00:09:38,567
Now the other one. Steady.

101
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,747
Right. Now, where's Victoria?

102
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:47,643
Quick Jamie, the time switch!

103
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:56,132
Twenty-eight, Doctor. Hey, Doctor, Kemel must have dropped this.

104
00:09:56,332 --> 00:09:57,287
Jamie!

105
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:01,930
We'll find Victoria and Kemel too.

106
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:45,923
Dear Kemel. Oh, there. Are any of the others here?

107
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:49,018
The Daleks?

108
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,719
You will wait here.

109
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,379
Oh, Mr. Maxtible.

110
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:02,016
Oh, what are you doing here?

111
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:05,087
Don't know. Nor even where here may be.

112
00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:10,733
Oh, we've been transported to the Dalek planet, my dear. To Skaro.

113
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:13,476
I don't understand you.

114
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:15,827
A little journey through space.

115
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:19,909
They've taken us somewhere. Is that what you mean? Away from your house?

116
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,396
Oh, far away. Far, far away.

117
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,922
But why? What do they want?

118
00:11:26,137 --> 00:11:30,164
Well, I know why I am here. But why you are here, I have not the faintest idea.

119
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:33,175
You seem to understand them. Ask them.

120
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,449
Don't be foolish, girl. I shall do no such thing.

121
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:36,987
And where's my father?

122
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:39,239
I do not know. I'm not a nursemaid to your father.

123
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:44,346
Follow me.

124
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,962
Of course, I shall do my best for you. The matter is really entirely out of my hands.

125
00:11:52,623 --> 00:12:34,744
It's no good. He won't help us. Don't worry Kemel, I shall protect you. I shall see they do you no harm. Yes, I suppose it was a bit silly. Think so? Wish I did.

126
00:12:35,516 --> 00:12:40,853
Oh well. Maybe between us we can fight them. We must face it out together.

127
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,832
And that is the Dalek city?

128
00:12:48,294 --> 00:12:49,741
Yes, it is.

129
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:52,437
I've scouted around, but I can't see any water.

130
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:54,895
Oh, please don't bother. I feel much better.

131
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,000
Are you sure?

132
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:56,837
Yes.

133
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,760
Come along then. We must get along.

134
00:12:58,969 --> 00:13:00,047
You mean just walk into the city?

135
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:06,528
Oh, no Jamie. The city is all around us. At least, um, it's beneath us. Come along.

136
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:16,947
How long have you known that's there?

137
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:21,173
Not a sound. I think the Daleks are in for a little surprise.

138
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:36,477
Where is the Doctor?

139
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:39,318
I had no time to get him.

140
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:40,686
No time?

141
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,840
I was told my house was going to be destroyed. Why?

142
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,956
You did not bring the Doctor?!

143
00:13:46,175 --> 00:14:11,044
Everything I possess is in that house. Everything. What right had you or anyone to destroy it? All these years of labour, all these years of research - destroyed through this caprice of yours. My laboratory - the only real thing in the whole of my existence - destroyed. I, Theodore Maxtible, made a bargain with you, and I demand to know... ah, ah!

144
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:15,360
Rights? Rights? Rights? Rights? You have disobeyed a Dalek command. You must obey the Dalek command.

145
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:18,639
Exterminate. Destroy.

146
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:23,603
I swear... I swear... I swear it's not my fault. I swear it's not my fault. I... No!

147
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,195
Move.

148
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:31,829
What's happening? What are you going to do with me?

149
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,175
Obey. Move.

150
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:59,194
These humans are still here.

151
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:02,567
Then other humans are inside the city.

152
00:15:09,065 --> 00:15:11,563
"Other humans inside the city", Kemel! Listen!

153
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:22,005
Emergency. Emergency. Human beings detected in city! Emergency! Emergency!

154
00:15:22,206 --> 00:15:25,666
Maybe it's Jamie and the Doctor. Oh, Kemel, there's a chance. A chance.

155
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:54,156
Intruders detected. Emergency! Emergency! Human beings detected in city. Emergency! Emergency! Intruders detected. All Daleks to observation stations. Repeat. All Daleks to observation stations. Emergency!

156
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:42,602
Stop! What is that mark?

157
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,402
That is my name.

158
00:16:45,644 --> 00:16:46,554
Name?

159
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,514
The Doctor gave it to me.

160
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:50,844
Doctor?

161
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:55,278
Yes. He is my friend.

162
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,016
Follow me.

163
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,219
Remain here.

164
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:39,131
What is happening? Do you know? They say there are other human beings in the city.

165
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:44,227
No. No thank you.

166
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:55,482
Why don't you answer me, you little fool. No one can help you here. No one but me.

167
00:17:55,727 --> 00:18:03,164
Silence. Follow me. You, wait.

168
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:08,076
I can't see anything.

169
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:09,354
Move.

170
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:11,341
Where are you taking me?

171
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:24,304
Oh, what are they doing to him?

172
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:32,128
You follow. You will wait.

173
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,573
I'll do as you say.

174
00:18:35,786 --> 00:18:43,252
Move forward, alone.

175
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:47,999
That was a human voice, I tell you.

176
00:18:48,182 --> 00:18:49,195
Perhaps it was, Jamie

177
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:50,600
We must go more quickly.

178
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:53,937
Victoria. That was Victoria's voice.

179
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:57,706
You can't. Where are you running to? Well, you mustn't. You'll go over the edge!

180
00:18:58,278 --> 00:19:03,282
Doctor, I am your friend.

181
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:07,818
One of your experiments, Doctor. For a moment I thought we were done for!

182
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:09,489
What is your name?

183
00:19:09,754 --> 00:19:11,202
Omega.

184
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,629
Oh, I see.

185
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:16,660
I have come to lead you.

186
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,756
Thank you.

187
00:19:19,873 --> 00:19:21,272
Oh, careful.

188
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:28,391
Oh, ah... I'm all right. Oh, thank you. Ah, lead on.

189
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,480
Follow me.

190
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:32,428
What was that screaming?

191
00:19:32,646 --> 00:19:33,958
A prisoner.

192
00:19:34,144 --> 00:19:34,799
Where?

193
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:38,412
Follow me. I will show you.

194
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,129
What are you doing?

195
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,063
Think I don't know my own mark? That wasn't the real Omega at all.

196
00:19:55,252 --> 00:19:57,382
Up to all sorts of tricks, aren't they?

197
00:19:57,552 --> 00:20:00,201
Oh, please. We must reach my daughter.

198
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:13,867
I tell you, they forced me. They threatened to kill us all. First of all, they ordered me to scream and I was to make you do the same.

199
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:15,833
And you had to do as you were told?

200
00:20:16,005 --> 00:20:17,702
I tell you, they threatened to kill me.

201
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:20,252
You came up behind me in the dark and twisted my arm.

202
00:20:20,421 --> 00:20:21,836
And what else could I do?

203
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:26,099
Oh, if only I'd realised. Why do you think they wanted us to scream like that?

204
00:20:26,337 --> 00:20:27,164
I've no idea.

205
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:37,369
You know perfectly well. There are other people in the city. They wanted to draw them on. Trap them. Oh, if only I could have thought quickly. Oh, Kemel.

206
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:31,342
No, no. I don't like the look of this. Back the way we came.

207
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:35,998
Follow me.

208
00:22:02,158 --> 00:22:04,197
Doctor!

209
00:22:07,057 --> 00:22:09,095
Look at the size of that thing.

210
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:13,315
So, you are the Doctor?

211
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:19,154
We meet at last. I wondered if we ever would.

212
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:22,071
The experiment is over.

213
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:29,932
Yes, I have implanted the "Human Factor" in the three Daleks that you gave me... When I say run, run!

214
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:31,684
Speak louder.

215
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:38,954
Promise me, Jamie. I was merely telling my friend that the day of the Daleks is coming to an end.

216
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:40,830
Explain.

217
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:56,390
It's very simple. Somewhere in the Dalek race there are three Daleks with the "Human Factor" Gradually, they will come to question. They will persuade other Daleks to question. You will have a rebellion on your planet!

218
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,361
NO!

219
00:22:57,604 --> 00:23:02,493
I say, yes. I've beaten you and I don't care what you do to me now.

220
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:10,324
Silence. The "Human Factor" showed us what the "Dalek Factor" was.

221
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,205
What?

222
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:15,302
Well, what does that mean?

223
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:21,532
Without knowing, you have shown the Daleks what their own strength is.

224
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,787
While you were doing one thing, they were really making you do another.

225
00:23:26,093 --> 00:23:30,647
The "Human Factor" is useless.

226
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,752
You still have those three Daleks to contend with.

227
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:43,392
They will be impregnated with the "Dalek Factor". Your discovery, but your work is not over.

228
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,446
I won't work for you!

229
00:23:46,696 --> 00:23:47,855
You will obey!

230
00:23:48,217 --> 00:23:49,411
What is the "Dalek Factor"?

231
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:56,341
You want me to guess? It means to obey, to fight, to destroy, to exterminate. I won't do it.

232
00:23:56,864 --> 00:23:57,841
Watch!

233
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,529
The TARDIS, Doctor!

234
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:16,033
You will take the "Dalek Factor. " You will spread it to the entire history of Earth!
