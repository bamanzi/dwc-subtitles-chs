哦, 谁在乎！啊, 有什么能帮到你的？

140

If you'd tell me where your bags are, sir - yours and the Doctor's
- I'll have them taken up to your room.
如果你能告诉我你的包裹在哪儿 —— 你和博士的 —— 我会让人把他们带到你的房间来的

Aye. well, Mollie...
啊, 这个, Mollie...

听我说, 我说“让人带过来” 其实我会亲自做的！

Haunted?
闹鬼？

I sleep like a log and always have.
嗯。不过, 我从来没听到过什么, 先生。我睡觉跟一根木头似的, 总是这样

I says to meself "Inkerman" and then it's all right.
嗯, 就是, 他有点怪, 或者脾气上来了, 就像最近那样。我跟自己说估计“英克曼人”就是那样

"Inkerman"?
“英克曼人”？

160

162
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:03,628
Oh... oh, I'm sorry sir. I didn't mean to... Well cook said to me
that if I did some dusting it would be all right.
哦。。。哦, 对不起先生。我不是有意的。。。厨师跟我说, 我打扫打扫就可以了

呜, 你得刷新一下你的历史知识了。我不可能总在你身边替你补课

Now then, in the Crimean War, the English, the French and the Turks
fought the Russians...
这一次, 克里米亚战争, 英国人、法国人和土耳其人一起跟俄国人打

00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,662
Oh, forget about all that!
哦, 忘了那些吧

Oh, I thought you'd be interested. I watched
the Charge of the Light Brigade. Magnificent folly...
哦, 我以为你会感兴趣。我可见过轻骑兵发起的冲锋, 那可真是愚蠢。。。

Jamie, you're in a temper!
Jamie, 你在闹脾气啊

174
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,541
Oh, am I? Is that bad then? Does that mean I won't be co-operative
- I won't do everything I'm told?
哦, 是吗？这很糟糕吧？是不是意味着我不会乖乖听话了？不会说什么我就做什么了？

and a man was murdered!
不, 博士, 你已经忘记 TARDIS 被偷了, 还有人被杀了

you as friendly as you like with the murderer!
现在, 我看见你跟杀人凶手在一起跟朋友似的, 你让我怎么想呢？

Waterfield did not murder that man!
Waterfield 没有杀那个人！

You're up to something with Waterfield and Maxtible.
你跟 Waterfield 还有 Maxtible 在搞些什么

That's not all you'll hear!

Jamie seems to think that I'm lying to him.

He doesn't believe the Daleks are here.

It's the truth.

- that your daughter was in Paris!

那你怎么不试着把她救回来, 嗯？你在忙些什么？

Well, what can I do? Now, be... be fair Jamie.
我能怎么做？现在。。。理智点 Jamie

204
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:48,104
Waterfield's tied hand and foot because of his daughter

Waterfield 因为他女儿而投鼠忌器, 我们因为 TARDIS 而束手束脚

205
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:53,801
Aye, and that's all you can think about, isn't it? The TARDIS.
Well, you can all stand around doing nothing. I'm sick to death of it!
啊, 你能想到的就只有这个, TARDIS, 是吗? 你就站在那里什么也不做？我恶心死了！

206
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:54,948
Now just where are you going?
你现在要去哪儿？

207
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:57,449
To be by myself for a bit. Do you mind?
一个人呆一会儿, 你管得着吗？

208
00:16:57,594 --> 00:17:02,828
No, not a bit. But, one word of warning.

不, 管不着。但警告你一句话, 别想一个人逞英雄。你别管这事

I won't have you ruining everything trying to rescue
Victoria Waterfield. Now, you understand?!
我不能允许你为了救 Victoria Waterfield 而毁了一切, 你听明白了没有？！

210
00:17:11,815 --> 00:17:15,221
Well, are you sure you didn't go a little too far, Doctor?
唉, 你确定这样是不是有点过火了, 博士？

211
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:22,170
Adding a little fuel to the fire.
Tell Maxtible that I'll be along to his laboratory shortly.
火上浇油。告诉 Maxtible 我很快就到他的实验室去

212
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:23,495
Oh, very well, Doctor. If you're sure.
哦, 好吧, 博士。如果你确定的话

he'll launch off on his own.
是的, 很确定。一旦我们的小朋友冷静一点, 他就会消停下来

214

And you dropped the hint about the south wing beautifully.
而且你也很漂亮地把南厢房的线索传递给他了

好了, 别提这个了。我之给你两分钟, 多了没有

That ain't fair!
这不公平

223
00:18:01,217 --> 00:18:07,623
You'll get no more from me. I warn you! Keep away from this house,
and this property. Find the nearest road to London and take it!
你别想从我这里得到更多钱。 我警告你, 离这个房子远点儿。找到去伦敦的路, 走吧

Oh, yeah, London, sir. Yeah, I daresay
I could earn something for me stories there.
哦, 是啊, 伦敦, 先生。好啊, 我敢说到了那里我评讲故事就可以挣到钱啦

225
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,774
Stories?
故事？

226
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:19,728

Don't play with me!

230

what I've got to tell 'em.

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,460
Indeed?

232

Yeah. You blows too hot and cold for me
- tellin' me this one minute and that the next, and not payin' up.
是啊, 你这一会儿阴一会儿晴, 一会儿这么说, 一会儿又那么说, 还不付钱

Hmm. Who'd believe you anyway?

Pay me off, and there's the end of it!

Oh, blackmail is it?! Get out!

238

Maybe I don't know much to tell, but I'll wager I'll find something
in the house that's worth me trouble.
也许我知道得不多, 但我打赌我能在这房子里找到点什么, 肯定有料

Completely?
完全封了？

247
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:17,894
Oh, no sir. Only 'cause of some repairs about a twelve-month back.
But the door may be locked.
哦, 不是, 先生。只是一些修缮工作, 都快一年了。不过门可能被锁住了

Off to hunt a few wee ghosties, Mollie.
去抓几个小鬼, Mollie

251
00:20:31,036 --> 00:20:37,637
Every single one of Jamie's reactions will be recorded
on these Dalek machines?
Jamie 的每个动作都会在 Dalek 的这些机器上记录下来？

252
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:43,435
And then transformed into thought patterns on silver wire.
A wonderful creation!
然后再转化成思维模型, 存储到银线。多么漂亮的发明！

253
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:50,539
It is for you, Doctor, to select the major feelings
to make up this "human factor".
这是为你准备的, 博士, 你可以用它来挑选出那些组成“人类特质”的主要情感
