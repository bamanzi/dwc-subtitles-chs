1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,266
Jamie!

3
00:00:56,534 --> 00:01:35,903
The TARDIS! Doctor!

4
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:37,987
Excuse me!

5
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,011
Eh?

6
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:42,563
I wonder if you could help us?

7
00:01:43,054 --> 00:01:45,765
My mate likes the wireless turned on at full blast.

8
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:47,199
I have to keep this turned down.

9
00:01:47,493 --> 00:01:48,127
Oh, I see.

10
00:01:48,405 --> 00:01:49,550
Who's taken the TARDIS?

11
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:52,075
He means the police telephone box.

12
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:53,808
He said 'TARDIS' or something.

13
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,940
Yes. Well, TARDIS... That's, uh... That's another name for it.

14
00:01:57,145 --> 00:01:58,226
Oh, foreign is he?

15
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:01,257
Me, foreign? You're the one that's foreign! I'm Scottish!

16
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:04,901
Uh, that's right. TARDIS is a... is a Gaelic word. Jamie, hush!

17
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,711
It's getting further away all the time!

18
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,011
Yes, I know.

19
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:11,159
Well anyway, it's... it's our property and we've come to collect it.

20
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:12,845
Oh, you mean the...

21
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:14,313
...uh, the police box?

22
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:15,111
Yes!

23
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:16,773
Yeah. Well, uh... Well, that's gone.

24
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:17,803
Oh, we...

25
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:21,353
...know it's gone. That's the whole point. Its ours and somebody's stolen it!

26
00:02:21,564 --> 00:02:23,759
Ah, well, I don't know about that. I got a note here somewhere.

27
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:31,664
Yeah, here we are. There. "Police Tel. Box. Collection: 3 o'clock".

28
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:32,750
Let me see this please.

29
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:33,702
Been signed for.

30
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:39,314
Oh, yes. So I see. Er... "J Smith". Doesn't really help us, does it?

31
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,371
Yeah. Well, I just do what I'm told. Better see the airport commandant or someone.

32
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:48,286
Oh, no. I... I don't think we'd better do that. Um, Jamie, I think we'd better talk to the police.

33
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,317
Of course I, um... I do know the name of the firm what picked it up.

34
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:53,217
You do?!

35
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,094
Yeah, firm name of, uh... Leatherman.

36
00:02:56,305 --> 00:02:58,078
Thank you very much. You'll be hearing from us.

37
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,312
Leatherman. Now that's a clue. Just a minute. Now, what street do they...? Doctor, wait!

38
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,781
Did you get all that?

39
00:03:11,052 --> 00:03:14,866
Every word. We'd better get going. Get your money back at the warehouse.

40
00:03:24,143 --> 00:03:25,923
We should have followed that clue he gave us.

41
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:28,970
Perhaps. I think we'd better keep an eye on him.

42
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:29,895
Why?

43
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:37,978
Well, didn't you notice his overalls? They were much too small for him, and the top sheet of his clipboard was different to all the others, and when we mentioned the police, he became friendly!

44
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:39,431
Aye. Hey, may...

45
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:57,760
Kennedy to base. Kennedy to base. Do you read me?

46
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,046
Kennedy to base. Do you read?

47
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:02,404
Yes.

48
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:04,685
The Doctor and his friend are following Bob Hall.

49
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:06,894
I knew they would suspect him.

50
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,809
I'll go on to the warehouse.

51
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:11,460
Very good, Mr Kennedy.

52
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:25,233
That's him. There he goes.

53
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:26,947
Oh, no!

54
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,399
For hire!

55
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:29,324
Eh?

56
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:30,672
Follow that car!

57
00:04:41,796 --> 00:04:42,704
Yes?

58
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:44,083
Perry, sir.

59
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,556
Oh, uh... One moment Mr. Perry.

60
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:54,370
It's here.

61
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:55,665
Good.

62
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,705
Like me to open the shutters, sir? Lovely day outside.

63
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:05,602
I have a choice between the sun or noise, Mr Perry. I regret shutting out one, but at least I keep out the other.

64
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:15,982
Yes. I say! That's very good. Just come in, eh? Mint condition. Eighteen, uh, seventy. Is it?

65
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:17,286
Approximately.

66
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,899
Don't know who your contacts are, sir, but this is marvellous!

67
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,726
Well, Victorian timepieces are my speciality, Mr. Perry.

68
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:24,692
Wish you'd tell me who makes them for you, sir.

69
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:29,015
But then you would be as wise as I, and that wouldn't do at all, would it?

70
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:36,371
Whoever makes them, Mr. Waterfield, they'd fool an expert. If I didn't know it was impossible, I would say it was absolutely genuine.

71
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:40,745
And, uh, there was no trouble with the box?

72
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:45,582
Apparently not. A bit out of our line, isn't it, sir? A battered old police box?

73
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:49,698
The whims and caprices of our patrons is our line, Mr Perry.

74
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,682
Hmm. Odd though.

75
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:58,652
Mr Perry, I pay you the sum of 50 guineas per week, do I not?

76
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:01,507
Pounds, actually sir. 50 pounds.

77
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:08,473
Yes, uh... I hope I may be forgiven if I believe that entitles me to demanding less curiosity of you.

78
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:10,620
Sorry, sir.

79
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,191
It is, I think you will agree, a princely salary.

80
00:06:13,637 --> 00:06:17,885
No complaints on that score. Long as I'm not asked to do anything dicey.

81
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:19,671
"Dicey?"

82
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,299
Crooked. Illegal.

83
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:27,586
Your candor is refreshing, Mr. Perry, even if your judgement of character is somewhat questionable.

84
00:06:27,862 --> 00:06:28,788
I didn't mean that...

85
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:35,914
I know perfectly well what you meant. You may rest assured, I shall not ask you to do anything "dicey. "

86
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:37,333
No, sir.

87
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,918
I think you are wanted in the shop, Mr. Perry.

88
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:44,510
And the, um... the telephone box, uh... What do we do with it?

89
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:47,059
Do? We do nothing.

90
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:49,225
Oh, right.

91
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:55,115
Nothing, except wait.

92
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:04,866
This is his car. He must be around here somewhere.

93
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:25,591
You sure you weren't followed?

94
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:32,236
No! Course I wasn't. Hey, you haven't told me what this little caper's about yet, uh, Kennedy.

95
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:36,551
Counted the money yet then, have ya?

96
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:37,525
No, not yet.

97
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:42,875
Or do you think I made a mistake giving ya two-fifty instead of seventy-five? We thought you might like a little extra.

98
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:43,810
What for?

99
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:45,162
You know those two at the hangar?

100
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:45,866
Yeah?

101
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:46,820
They're outside.

102
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,151
You weren't followed!

103
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:51,968
We'll be ready for them, won't we? That's what the extra's for.

104
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:53,971
Now listen...

105
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:58,001
You on one side of the door, me on the other. Right? Straight over their heads. They won't even know what hit them.

106
00:07:58,221 --> 00:07:59,135
Ah, not me, mate.

107
00:07:59,357 --> 00:08:00,930
It's a bit late to argue, isn't it? They're outside.

108
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:03,580
Now listen, I'm not getting mixed up in no kidnapping, and that's flat!

109
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:04,437
Oh, dear...

110
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:12,342
Doctor?

111
00:08:15,324 --> 00:08:16,620
Well, have you tried the door?

112
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:29,071
Man in the overalls! It's all right. He's alive.

113
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:34,294
Oh, dear... Where's Ken...

114
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:36,113
Ken? Ken who?

115
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:37,937
Make him tell us where the TARDIS is!

116
00:08:38,337 --> 00:08:49,110
No good, he's out cold. See if we can find some water somewhere. Hello, this is something. This really is something.

117
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:55,911
But, why pay him to help steal the TARDIS and then knock him on the head?

118
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:57,537
Well, why steal the TARDIS anyway?

119
00:08:57,883 --> 00:08:59,646
That's what's been bothering me, Jamie, too.

120
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:03,497
There's no water here. Hey, that looks a lot of money, Doctor.

121
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:17,022
It's between two and three hundred pounds. Yes, it is a lot, at least for what he had to do - put on a pair of overalls and just hang around. Come to think of it, why hang around? He was obviously planted. Why not just go off in the lorry?

122
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:19,864
You found something else?

123
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:21,010
I don't know.

124
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:36,515
Yes, this man rolled his own cigarettes, so these must belong to somebody else. That's a fair assumption.

125
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:38,710
What's that?

126
00:09:38,922 --> 00:09:40,201
It's all right. It's only a train.

127
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:41,126
A what?

128
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:46,063
Well, it's a train. There are carriages and they go on wheels, on rails, and they're drawn by a stea...

129
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:47,217
Hey, come back!

130
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:55,658
Well, give us a hand!

131
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:03,470
Aw, not a sign of him. The only chance we had.

132
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:05,158
There is this...

133
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:11,230
"The Tricolour". It's a coffee bar apparently. And that's not all.

134
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,477
Well, what else?

135
00:10:12,664 --> 00:10:16,502
Well, normally people pull out their matches from right to left. These have been torn out from left to right.

136
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:17,786
What does that mean?

137
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:27,788
It means we've got to find a coffee bar called "The Tricolour" and look for a man called Ken or Kenneth - someone who's left-handed.

138
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:29,308
Now we've got something to go on!

139
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:37,387
But it's so little, Jamie. It's too little. He might only have been there once. There's no guarantee he'll ever go there again.

140
00:10:37,548 --> 00:10:40,722
Now, don't give up Doctor. Remember Bruce.

141
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:42,121
Bruce?

142
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:43,574
Robert Bruce.

143
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:55,180
Look, I told...

144
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,540
They were not aware that you were watching?

145
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,189
No, they were too busy trying to work it all out.

146
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,179
Good.

147
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:04,398
That Bob Hall was a bit of a problem. I didn't think he'd turn nasty.

148
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,697
You didn't hurt him?

149
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,521
Him? You're joking.

150
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:10,298
I can assure you that I am not.

151
00:11:10,488 --> 00:11:14,892
He's a lot bigger than me, you know. No, I just baggered him one and that was it.

152
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:20,047
That was what? Kennedy, I must know precisely what has happened. How badly injured was Hall?

153
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:24,367
Well, a bit dazed, that's all. He just mumbled something and made a run for it when they weren't looking.

154
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,745
And where is he now?

155
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:32,301
Well, I went round to his place later. There he was coming out the front door, zip bag and everything. He got in a cab and went to Euston.

156
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:35,120
Were you able to find another hansom and follow him?

157
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,159
Eh?

158
00:11:36,469 --> 00:11:37,817
Did you follow him?

159
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,914
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about him. He's gone up north.

160
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:48,168
That disposes of that. Now, this is extremely important: you did leave the matches?

161
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:51,838
Don't worry about it. The Doctor found the cigarettes and the matches.

162
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:55,115
And you are certain they were the ones bearing the name of the coffee shop?

163
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,000
Coffee bar.

164
00:11:56,243 --> 00:11:56,760
Yes.

165
00:11:57,013 --> 00:12:02,449
Yes. I told you, it worked like a charm. I never thought it would, but you were quite right. He got onto the name on the matches straight away.

166
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:16,610
Well, just one last thing, to make quite sure: now you are certain that these are the people that you saw?

167
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:19,356
That's them, yeah. Yeah, definite.

168
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:27,056
Right. Well, I shall want you to keep out of sight. You'd better stay in the house, and on no account are you to talk to Mr. Perry about any of this.

169
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:27,889
OK.

170
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:30,357
"OK."? What does that mean?

171
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,174
What? Yes!

172
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:38,714
Oh, I know that my attitude may appear strange to you on occasions, Kennedy.

173
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:44,308
You want to play the part of the Victorian grandfather, that's all right by me. Must be a pretty good gimmick. You pay me well enough.

174
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:47,331
It, uh... helps to sell to our customers.

175
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:57,934
Yeah, sure, sure. You've, uh... never told me what it is exactly you've got against this Doctor and his friend. Some kind of vendetta or something?

176
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:02,779
Explanations are not part of our arrangement.

177
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:04,308
Oh, just wondering.

178
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,856
Imagination is a virtue, but it can become a vice.

179
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:09,510
Mind me own business, yeah. I get the message.

180
00:13:09,786 --> 00:13:12,268
Ask Mr. Perry to come and see me, will you, please?

181
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:09,790
He wants to see you.

182
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:11,176
Oh, thank you.

183
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:14,886
Who is it?

184
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:16,576
It's Perry, sir.

185
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:17,822
One moment.

186
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:23,014
You wanted to see me, sir?

187
00:14:23,616 --> 00:14:28,860
Yes, I have an extremely important and delicate task for you to perform.

188
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:29,905
Oh, yes?

189
00:14:30,273 --> 00:14:32,753
I say, you got a new delivery.

190
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:34,521
Y... yes.

191
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:36,202
I didn't see it arrive.

192
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:43,022
It was delivered last night. I've only just brought it in myself. It is, uh... for a new customer.

193
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:44,173
Oh, yes?

194
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:48,609
A Dr. Galloway. He's extremely wealthy and an ardent collector...

195
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,517
Of, uh... Victoriana, sir?

196
00:14:50,676 --> 00:14:57,750
No less. I do not know the Doctor personally, but we have arranged to meet in the coffee shop, uh... bar, nearby.

197
00:14:57,907 --> 00:14:59,520
Oh, the Tricolour, sir?

198
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:10,450
Yes. Unfortunately, I am unable to keep the appointment, so I want you to go instead, Mr. Perry. Here is a photograph of Dr. Galloway.

199
00:15:10,936 --> 00:15:21,135
This is his assistant and secretary, Mr. James McCrimmon. Now I want you to ask the Doctor to come to the shop tonight, say at, uh... ten o' clock.

200
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,464
Ten o'clock, sir?!

201
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:28,363
Yes. Oh, don't worry, Mr. Perry. I shall be attending to him myself. You needn't wait.

202
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:29,757
Oh, right sir.

203
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:36,781
The Doctor is notoriously unpunctual. I fear you may have a long and tedious wait.

204
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:38,958
I shall find him sir. Do you want me to go now?

205
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,446
If you please, Mr. Perry.

206
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,349
Right.

207
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:33,988
And what are you doing?

208
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:35,781
I... I can't make Mr. Waterfield hear me. I knocked.

209
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:36,718
He's busy.

210
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:37,947
O.K. I'll try later.

211
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:58,028
Don't look so depressed, Doctor.

212
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,769
If only we knew what he looked like, Jamie.

213
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:03,450
We'll ask one of the lasses in a moment, when things get quieter.

214
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:06,444
We've got to untangle this, you know.

215
00:17:06,645 --> 00:17:11,470
It's all quite obvious to me. They're just robbers. Thieves, you understand.

216
00:17:11,684 --> 00:17:17,058
No, no, there's more to it than that. Why leave that man in the hangar to give us a clue?

217
00:17:17,254 --> 00:17:19,597
Which we haven't followed up, you know. "Leatherman?"

218
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:25,580
There is no delivery firm of that name. Not in the London area, anyway. I checked in the phone book.

219
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:27,653
But surely there's more places than London.

220
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:28,703
Maybe.

221
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:32,622
Do you think this is sort of a trap, Doctor?

222
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:36,025
Yes, but if only we knew who our enemies are...

223
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:37,941
Not the Chameleons again!

224
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:43,893
No, something else. I can feel them, closing in all around us.

225
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:57,508
I've done everything that you've asked of me. Isn't that enough? Now you must tell me the truth. Do you hear?! The truth!

226
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:07,712
But, you must tell me. I demand! I'm talking to you! Come back!

227
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:52,879
Oh, if only the laird could see that! Why do I get all the difficult tasks, Doctor?

228
00:18:53,487 --> 00:18:57,266
Because you're so much better at them than I am, Jamie. What did you find out?

229
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:01,021
None of the lasses here could remember anybody called Ken or Kenneth.

230
00:19:01,242 --> 00:19:01,904
Oh, dear.

231
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:05,430
Aye. But, they do have a different lot on duty in the evening. Now, maybe they'll know.

232
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,553
Jamie, I'm being stared at. Is there something wrong with me?

233
00:19:11,924 --> 00:19:13,367
You mean up here Doctor?

234
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:14,841
Is my hair in disarray?

235
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,813
Well, no more than usual.

236
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,088
Do I look strange or bizarre?

237
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,505
Aye. Well, maybe I'm just used to you.

238
00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:24,808
That's some comfort. Look out, he's coming over.

239
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:25,989
I beg your pardon.

240
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:28,464
Not at all.

241
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:29,842
It is Dr. Galloway, isn't it?

242
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:30,686
Dr. Gallo-?

243
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:31,723
...and Mr. McCrimmon.

244
00:19:31,908 --> 00:19:32,994
Aye, I'm Jamie McCrimmon.

245
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:34,246
My card.

246
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:37,009
Yes, uh...

247
00:19:37,304 --> 00:19:38,538
Mr. Perry?

248
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:41,902
Mr. Waterfield's frightfully sorry, but he can't meet you as arranged.

249
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:45,506
Oh. Oh, dear. What a pity.

250
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:50,530
But, he says if you'd care to come to the shop at about, uh... ten tonight, he'll see to you personally.

251
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:55,700
At about 10. Oh, yes, uh... We'll be there.

252
00:19:56,023 --> 00:19:56,782
Righto.

253
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,969
Right! Right!

254
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,732
"Edward Waterfield: Genuine Victoriana".

255
00:20:07,924 --> 00:20:11,102
Can't be a mistake. Even though he got your name wrong, he knew mine.

256
00:20:11,438 --> 00:20:13,916
I wonder if Mr. Kenneth has found us.

257
00:20:14,168 --> 00:20:14,723
Eh?

258
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:22,167
"K. Perry Esquire". Yes, I think we'll go and see Mr. Edward Waterfield.

259
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,919
And he, uh... definitely said he would be here?

260
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:27,132
Yes, sir.

261
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:29,760
Thank you. You have done excellently, Mr. Perry.

262
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:30,587
Er...

263
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,407
Good night.

264
00:20:31,588 --> 00:20:32,675
See you in the morning, sir.

265
00:20:32,852 --> 00:20:37,549
Uh, yes. Yes, in the morning.

266
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:49,856
Kennedy? Kennedy?

267
00:20:54,747 --> 00:21:02,029
The Doctor is coming here tonight. I shall want you to help me. And you had better put some warm clothes on. Dark things.

268
00:21:02,236 --> 00:21:06,861
All right. You'd better make sure that police box is well covered-up, in case the Doctor starts snooping about.

269
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:09,628
Yes.

270
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:39,062
Who are you? Who are you? Answer!
