electric charges, all positive.
每一面都是金属抛光制成的, 还会充上电, 一开始都是正电

187
00:17:02,598 --> 00:17:05,424
MAXTIBLE: Like repels like in electricity, Doctor,
正如电负荷会同性相斥, 博士

188
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:10,210

- DOCTOR: You mentioned static electricity...
- WATERFIELD: That was our last experiment.
- 你刚才提到了静电。。。   - 那是我们最后的实验
<i>（注: Daleks 的一个典型特征是采用静电作为个体能源, 博士在这里显然已经怀疑是Deleks在作怪了。Daleks首次出场01x02 The Daleks中第一任博士和Ian, Barbara他们就发现了Daleks采用静电作为能源。04x03 The Power of the Daleks中Daleks铺设静电传输地板以方便他们自己行动）</i>

190
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:19,151

负电与正电都失败了, 所以我们尝试了静电

191
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,781
- WATERFIELD: If only we had know the powers we'd unleash.
- DOCTOR: Powers?

creatures burst out of the cabinet,

to get you with your colleague Mr McCrimmon.
