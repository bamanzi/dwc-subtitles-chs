Now, this is my theory.
好了, 现在说说我的理论

179
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:21,648
- A mirror reflects an image, does it not?  - Yes.
- 一面镜子可以反射图像, 对不？  - 可以

180
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:27,272
So, you may be standing there
and yet appear to be standing 50 feet away.
所以, 你可以站在这里, 但又好像出现在50英尺之外

181
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,788
Following the new investigations 12 years ago
by J Clark Maxwell into electromagnetism,
基于麦克斯韦在12年前在提出的电磁场理论

182
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:39,924
and the experiments by Faraday into static electricity...
以及法拉第的静电实验。。。

183
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,360
- Static?  - Correct.
- 静电？    - 对

184
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:46,985
.. Waterfield and I first attempted to define the image in the mirror,
。。Waterfield 和我试验了在镜子中固定图像

185
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:49,708
and then to project it.
然后再投射出去

186
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:57,361
In here, Doctor, are 144 separate mirrors.
这里, 博士, 有144面镜子

187
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:02,433
Each is of polished metal.
Each is subjected to electric charges, all positive.
每一面都是金属抛光制成的, 还会充上电, 一开始都是正电

188
00:17:02,598 --> 00:17:05,424
Like repels like in electricity, Doctor,
正如电负荷会同性相斥, 博士

189
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:10,210
and so we attempted to repel the image in the mirrors wherever we directed.
于是我们尝试了在镜子间反射图像, 以让它到达我们期望的地方

190
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:14,681
- You mentioned static electricity...  - That was our last experiment.
- 你刚才提到了静电。。。   - 那是我们最后的实验
<i>（注: Daleks 的一个典型特征是采用静电作为个体能源, 博士在这里显然已经怀疑是Deleks在作怪了。Daleks首次出场01x02 The Daleks中第一任博士和Ian, Barbara他们就发现了Daleks采用静电作为能源。04x03 The Power of the Daleks中Daleks铺设静电传输地板以方便他们自己行动）</i>

191
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:19,151
Negative and positive electricity had failed, so we tried static.
负电与正电都失败了, 所以我们尝试了静电

192
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,781
- If only we had know the powers we'd unleash.  - Powers?
- 要是我早点知道就好了, 我们会放出什么样的力量   - 力量？

193
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:28,012
In the middle of our final test with static,
creatures burst out of the cabinet,
在我们最后一次静电实验中, 有种生物从柜子里面蹦出来了

194
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:32,082
invaded the house and took away my daughter.
入侵了我们的房子, 带走了我的女儿

195
00:17:32,248 --> 00:17:35,869
Oh, my dear fellow! My dear, dear fellow!
哦, 我亲爱的朋友, 可怜的家伙！

196
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,025
We shall win through, now that the Doctor is here.
既然博士现在来了, 我们应该能赢了

197
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,860
These creatures...
这些生物。。。

198
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:44,172
We had opened the way for them with our experiments.
是我们的实验给他们打开了大门

199
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,246
They forced me into the horror of time travel.
他们强迫我进行时间旅行

200
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:50,398
They ordered me to steal a box belonging to you

201
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:55,390
and thus lure you into a trap and transport you here,
to get you with your colleague Mr McCrimmon.
以钓你上钩, 再把你们传输过来, 以抓住你和你的朋友 McCrimmon 先生

202
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:58,744
- They knew about me?  - They gave us likenesses.
- 他们认识我？    - 他们给了我们详细描述

203
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:01,971
What could I do? They said my daughter would die.
我能怎么办？ 他们说否则我的女儿就得死

204
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:07,155
<i>- What are they called, these creatures?  - Doctor!</i>
- 他们叫什么名字, 这些生物？  - 博士！

205
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:11,915
<i>Now do you understand?</i>
现在你明白了吧？

206
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:15,783
Oh, yes. Perfectly.

210
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:31,849
<i>We have your time ship. We will destroy it
unless you help us with an experiment.</i>
我们得到了你的时间飞船, 我们将销毁它, 除非你帮我们完成一向实验

211
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:33,056
- What experiment?
- 什么实验？

212

In the long run, yes.
