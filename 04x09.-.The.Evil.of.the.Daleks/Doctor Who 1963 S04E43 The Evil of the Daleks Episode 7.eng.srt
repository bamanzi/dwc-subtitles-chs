1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:37,922
The TARDIS, Doctor!

3
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:47,716
You will take the "Dalek Factor. " You will spread it to the entire history of Earth!

4
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:52,109
No. You can't make me do it! You can't!

5
00:00:52,314 --> 00:00:54,451
You will obey!

6
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:55,811
Move!

7
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:59,212
Doctor.

8
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:03,313
You will obey!

9
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,025
Experiment ready.

10
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,608
Proceed.

11
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:18,587
Transmutation of metal into gold.

12
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:24,797
You mean to say, he's worked against us all, just for that?

13
00:01:25,082 --> 00:01:26,851
People have done worse for less, Jamie.

14
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:30,781
Look, it's daft though. Metal into gold is an old wives tale.

15
00:01:31,012 --> 00:01:36,314
Oh I don't know. The alchemists of the middle ages made transmutation their main aim in life.

16
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:37,750
Ah, they didn't succeed though.

17
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:41,563
Even in the twentieth century, it's still considered scientifically possible.

18
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:43,136
Of course it's possible.

19
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:45,321
Oh, well, I don't care whether it's possible or not!

20
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:47,770
Whether it is or whether it isn't is beside the point.

21
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:49,001
Oh, and what is the point then?

22
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,349
Why are the do... Daleks doing this?

23
00:01:51,526 --> 00:01:52,794
They promised me!

24
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:54,731
Daleks don't keep their promises.

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,724
I see what you're trying to do Doctor. You're trying to shake my faith. But I will be given the secret.

26
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:04,895
Oh, well. It won't do you any good, because you won't be able to use your secret! I'll see to that.

27
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:06,035
You'll do no such thing!

28
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:07,465
Jamie!

29
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:08,979
Move away! Move!

30
00:02:09,284 --> 00:02:10,578
Please Jamie, do as it says.

31
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:16,411
You will not harm this human being. Or you will be exterminated.

32
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:18,208
Yes, yes. We quite understand.

33
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:21,019
You would be advised to do as they say.

34
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:24,516
Oh don't worry. The very thought of going near you repulses me.

35
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:25,819
Mr. McCrimmon.

36
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,172
They seem prepared to protect you.

37
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:41,474
Be warned.

38
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:52,730
I appeal to you, Maxtible. It may still not be too late. If they're your friends, help us. If you did, we could plan something - try to escape.

39
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:53,895
No.

40
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:57,126
Then at least for Victoria's sake. After what you did to her.

41
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:58,879
No, I tell you! No!

42
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:04,191
It's no good, Papa. He doesn't listen any more.

43
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,136
What are you thinking?

44
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:31,002
I'm trying to puzzle out a problem, Victoria. The Daleks say I'm going to do something for them. Something I would rather die than do.

45
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:35,703
Plus or minus point zero, zero, three. Plus or minus.

46
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:37,721
Perhaps they think you're like him.

47
00:03:37,975 --> 00:03:40,361
Oh, no. The Daleks know me well enough by this time.

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,215
They intend to persuade you then.

49
00:03:42,484 --> 00:03:51,242
Oh no. No it isn't that either. You see, there isn't a persuasion strong enough. Not even the offer of all the lives in this room.

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,386
I see.

51
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:57,711
Five lives against a whole planet? Well, it's not a choice is it.

52
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,886
No.

53
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:13,425
Even if I could trust the Daleks - even if they set us free, we still couldn't go back to Earth. I suppose I might try to take you all to another universe. I might even try and take you to my own planet.

54
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:14,495
Your own?

55
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:18,898
Yes. Oh, yes. I... I live a long, long way from Earth.

56
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:28,729
Oh, just a minute. Maxtible! Arthur Terrall! The Daleks put some kind of control device on him.

57
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:35,692
What of it? It was erratic. I always warned the Daleks it would prove too unsatisfactory.

58
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,359
Aye. Well, it's a good thing for you it did fail. They'd have tried it on you next.

59
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:51,561
Report!

60
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:54,073
The experiment is ready.

61
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,718
Proceed.

62
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,785
Discontinue work.

63
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:13,220
Discontinue work. Discontinue work.

64
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:16,946
Why?

65
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:24,584
WHO SPOKE! WHO QUESTIONED A DALEK COMMAND?!

66
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:33,744
The secret of transmutation of metal.

67
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:36,768
Yes, yes! The secret you promised me.

68
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:38,823
Turn and look.

69
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:47,231
Above. Liquid metal. Read.

70
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:49,020
Wait!

71
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:50,563
Do not move!

72
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:52,528
It is hard to see.

73
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:58,196
Fifty-five point eight, four.

74
00:05:58,406 --> 00:06:01,739
Atomic weight. Read again.

75
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,670
Seven point eight, four.

76
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,962
Specific gravity.

77
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:09,787
Atomic weight and gravity of iron.

78
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:14,349
Watch. Read atomic weight.

79
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,727
Nineteen point two.

80
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:21,753
Read specific gravity.

81
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:23,851
Sixty-nine point five.

82
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:28,814
Gold! Iron into gold!

83
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:37,210
I told you it was possible! They've kept their promise! It's true! It's true! They have!

84
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:38,926
The machine is yours.

85
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:42,831
Yes. Ha, ha. Yes, Yes!

86
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:46,381
Maxtible, if you value your life, don't go near that machine!

87
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,196
Maxtible!

88
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:58,430
What have they done to him!

89
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,185
Turn.

90
00:07:07,924 --> 00:07:10,044
Move to control.

91
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,919
I obey.

92
00:07:24,703 --> 00:07:26,008
They've turned him into a Dalek.

93
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,355
Yes. The Dalek factor.

94
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:33,415
Is that what you want me to do to the people of Earth.

95
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:36,961
We know you will obey.

96
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:47,538
Human beings into Daleks.

97
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,145
Emperor.

98
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:52,440
Speak!

99
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:55,351
A Dalek questioned an order.

100
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:59,371
Questioned? Then it was one of the test Daleks.

101
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:00,292
Yes.

102
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:02,698
Find it, immediately!

103
00:08:44,369 --> 00:09:07,399
Doctor. Open your eyes. You are asleep still, but you can hear my voice. I have come to help you. Look at the box.

104
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:21,178
I have had your TARDIS placed outside the city. I will take you to it. Rise and follow me.

105
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:44,568
Hey, Doctor, what are you doing?

106
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:48,602
Don't go near the door! Doctor!

107
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:01,036
Doctor!

108
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,604
Stay where you are! That is an order!

109
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:19,462
We will work together on the Dalek Factor. Follow me.

110
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:21,821
I obey!

111
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,692
Stop!

112
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:50,431
This machine is for the mass-production of the Dalek Factor. Follow me.

113
00:10:56,567 --> 00:11:13,623
Stop. This machine will transform the thought patterns in this capsule into a steam. The steam will be sprayed into the atmosphere of the Earth.

114
00:11:14,979 --> 00:11:17,955
I must examine the machine.

115
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:19,300
Do so.

116
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:20,280
Jamie. Jamie! Jamie!

117
00:12:21,947 --> 00:12:22,792
Yes?

118
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:27,888
Jamie, when I give you the word, bring everyone through this archway. Through the door.

119
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,850
What?!

120
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:29,816
Trust me!

121
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,306
What are you doing?

122
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:35,693
Take me to your emperor.

123
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:36,895
Wait.

124
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:51,048
We walked through! All just as though he was...

125
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:53,037
It must have affected him. We saw it happen.

126
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:54,849
But you heard him speak normally just now.

127
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,161
Another trap to make us walk though?

128
00:12:57,331 --> 00:12:59,482
Oh, they could have pushed us in here any time they liked.

129
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:01,998
Do you think there's a chance? Something to hope for?

130
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:07,422
I, uh... I don't know. Well, I... I don't understand. I mean, how do we know we can trust him?

131
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:20,107
What do you want?

132
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:24,176
A Dalek questioned an order.

133
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:25,747
Again?

134
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:29,547
We have searched without success.

135
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:46,816
All Daleks must pass through the archway door. The Dalek with the human factor will then become a Dalek again - will become as this human and I have become.

136
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:48,484
Let it be done!

137
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:49,813
I obey!

138
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:59,547
You will deal with the human prisoners.

139
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:38,478
Go on quickly! Through the door! Follow them through the door! Oh, it's all right. I've changed over the Factors. I used one of the capsules from my test Dalek. I've given them all the human factor! Go on! Go on!

140
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,589
Well, aren't you coming?

141
00:14:41,785 --> 00:14:43,802
Well, I've got things to do. And I've been through already.

142
00:14:43,962 --> 00:14:45,918
Ah, well, why didn't it affect you then?

143
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:53,547
I don't come from Earth, Jamie. Now, down the corridor, turn to the left and find the tunnel. I'll join you there later.

144
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:56,660
Oh well, here goes.

145
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,728
It's all right, nothing happened! Come on! Come on Kemel. Quick!

146
00:15:10,936 --> 00:15:13,964
Victoria, I must help the Doctor!

147
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,213
Och, don't be a fool man!

148
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:16,303
Father! No!

149
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:23,464
I must find Maxtible. He's to blame for all of this. Take care of her.

150
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:25,954
But father!

151
00:15:26,144 --> 00:15:27,815
Oh, he'll be all right. Come on!

152
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:50,199
Ah! Dizzy!

153
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:51,682
Dizzy!

154
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:54,443
Daleks!

155
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:58,176
Dizzy Daleks!

156
00:15:58,997 --> 00:16:01,587
Dizzy Daleks!

157
00:16:02,592 --> 00:16:04,979
Dizzy!

158
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:10,160
Where are the prisoners?

159
00:16:10,543 --> 00:16:12,416
I do not know.

160
00:16:12,844 --> 00:16:14,309
Continue working.

161
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:15,483
Why?

162
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,670
Yes, why?

163
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,590
Do not question.

164
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:25,529
Why? Why not question? Why? Why? Why?

165
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:30,502
Silence! You will obey!

166
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:32,924
I will not obey!

167
00:16:48,845 --> 00:16:51,205
You will obey without question!

168
00:17:12,517 --> 00:17:18,305
Quickly, this way! Follow me Daleks! This way! Come on!

169
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,572
Return to your work.

170
00:17:24,903 --> 00:17:25,665
Why?

171
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:27,751
Do not question.

172
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:31,997
Why not question? What work? Tell them?

173
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:33,214
Silence!

174
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:34,351
Explain.

175
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:35,430
What work?

176
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:37,387
Why obey without question?

177
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,336
Ask the Emperor!

178
00:17:39,564 --> 00:17:40,408
The Emperor!

179
00:17:40,618 --> 00:17:42,153
Yes, ask the Emperor!

180
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:44,833
Keep back, you cannot enter!

181
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:46,244
Why?

182
00:17:46,468 --> 00:17:47,102
Why?

183
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,825
Why?

184
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:50,128
The Emperor must explain.

185
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:56,941
Defend yourselves Daleks! The black Daleks are attacking you!

186
00:17:57,218 --> 00:18:05,009
All Black Dalek Leaders to Control. Exterminate all opposition! Destroy rebels!

187
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:06,703
Come on! This way! Come on!

188
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:08,657
I will obey.

189
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:11,293
But not without question.

190
00:18:11,503 --> 00:18:12,859
That's right. Question!

191
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,601
Doctor!

192
00:18:15,055 --> 00:18:16,727
The Black Daleks are attacking every...

193
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:17,453
Hurry man!

194
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,011
The Emperor has commanded it.

195
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,874
Why?

196
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,547
Why?

197
00:18:20,993 --> 00:18:26,131
Because you question. Defend yourselves. Destroy the Emperor. Or be destroyed yourselves!

198
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:26,766
Hurry!

199
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:27,847
Destroy the Emperor!

200
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:29,337
We must go, Doctor.

201
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,934
Yes, I know. I'm finished now.

202
00:18:45,142 --> 00:18:47,937
Now lie still. I'll try to get help to you.

203
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,205
No time for help.

204
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:53,152
You saved my life, didn't you?

205
00:18:53,970 --> 00:19:02,949
Yes. Good life to save. Please, you must... Victoria.

206
00:19:03,232 --> 00:19:05,942
Don't worry about Victoria. We'll look after her.

207
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:09,909
No... time... for... me...

208
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,090
The Emperor has commanded your destruction!

209
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,620
Why? Why? Why?

210
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:19,932
Well, your friends are fighting for you!

211
00:19:20,081 --> 00:19:20,702
Friends?

212
00:19:20,863 --> 00:19:21,794
Down there. Help them.

213
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:22,623
Friends.

214
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:30,051
Exterminate! Annihilate them!

215
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:47,905
Danger! This is your Emperor speaking! There is danger here! Obey me! Do not fight in here! Do not fight in here! I said, Obey! Obey!

216
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:50,131
Obey me!

217
00:19:51,839 --> 00:20:11,551
Obey me! Your Emperor is ordering you. Do not fight in here! Do not fight in here! Obey! I am your Emperor! Daleks, obey me! Obey! Obey! Obey!

218
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:21,208
You will be exterminated! All exterminated. Annihilated! You will all be exterminated! Annihilated!

219
00:20:23,576 --> 00:20:32,682
THE DALEK RACE WILL DIE OUT COMPLETELY! Obey your Emperor! Obey! Ob...

220
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:54,410
Kemel! Come here!

221
00:21:00,254 --> 00:21:23,217
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

222
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:31,552
Attention! Attention! Emergency! Emergency! All Daleks return to control immediately!

223
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:33,626
Poor Kemel!

224
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:25,348
The Daleks must not... cannot be destroyed. The race will survive! The Daleks will live! And Rule! FOR EVER!

225
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,670
Doctor.

226
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,151
Jamie! Jamie!

227
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:49,477
A Dalek nearly caught us, but I... I tossed it over the edge. But... poor Kemel.

228
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,456
Kemel?

229
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:51,824
Aye. You see, he was trying...

230
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:53,230
Where is my father?

231
00:22:54,738 --> 00:22:56,434
Is... is he dead?

232
00:22:56,663 --> 00:23:07,181
Yes. Yes, I'm afraid he is. But, he didn't die in vain. I think we have seen the end of the Daleks, forever!

233
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:11,805
Jamie, we must move along to the TARDIS. It's over there.

234
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,699
We can't leave her alone, Doctor.

235
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:16,271
We're not going to leave her. She's coming with us!

236
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:24,932
The end. The final end!

237
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:31,297
Destroy! Destroy!
