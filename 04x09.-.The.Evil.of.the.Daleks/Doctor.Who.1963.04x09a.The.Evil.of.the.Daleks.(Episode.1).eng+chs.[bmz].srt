我在阳光和噪音之间做了一个选择, Perry先生。

Mint condition. Eighteen, uh, seventy. Is it?

真期望您能告诉我是谁给您做的, 先生

71
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:29,015
WATERFIELD: But then you would be as wise as I, and that wouldn't do at all, would it?
那样的话你就跟我一样聪明了, 这样可行不通, 是吧？

72
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:36,371
PERRY: Whoever makes them, Mr. Waterfield, they'd fool an expert.
If I didn't know it was impossible, I would say it was absolutely genuine.
不管是谁吧, Waterfield 先生, 他们绝对可以骗过专家。
假设我并不知道这是不可能的, 我得说这件绝对是真品

另外, 盒子不会有什么问题吧

A battered old police box?
看起来不会。不过跟其它的有点不太配套, 不是吗, 先生？一座破旧的警用电话亭？

75
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:49,698
WATERFIELD: The whims and caprices of our patrons is our line, Mr Perry.
我们的主线就是让客户感到新奇、多变, Perry先生

76
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,682
PERRY: Hmm. Odd though.
唔, 还是有点怪

77
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:58,652
WATERFIELD: Mr Perry, I pay you the sum of 50 guineas per week, do I not?
Perry先生, 每星期我付给你50金币, 对不？

英镑, 先生, 50英镑

79
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:08,473
WATERFIELD: Yes, uh... I hope I may be forgiven if I believe
that entitles me to demanding less curiosity of you.
是的, 哦。。。如果我觉得这可以允许我要求你少一点好奇心, 期望你不会觉得我太过分

80
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:10,620
PERRY: Sorry, sir.
抱歉, 先生

81
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,191

我对此完全满意。只要不让我去做一些太冒险的事情

83
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:19,671
WATERFIELD: "Dicey?"
“冒险？“

84
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,299
PERRY: Crooked. Illegal.
邪恶的, 非法的

85
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:27,586
WATERFIELD: Your candor is refreshing, Mr. Perry,
even if your judgement of character is somewhat questionable.
你还挺直率的, Perry 先生。不过你的他人的判断有点问题

86
00:06:27,862 --> 00:06:28,788
PERRY: I didn't mean that...
我并不是这个意思。。。

87
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:35,914
WATERFIELD: I know perfectly well what you meant.
You may rest assured, I shall not ask you to do anything "dicey. "
我完全知道你什么意思。你放心吧, 我不会要求你做什么冒险的事情

88
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:37,333
PERRY: No, sir.
不会的, 先生

89
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,918
WATERFIELD: I think you are wanted in the shop, Mr. Perry.
我想你店里需要你, Perry先生

90
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:44,510
PERRY: And the, um... the telephone box, uh... What do we do with it?
不过那个。。。那个电话亭。。。我们拿它怎么办？

91
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:47,059
WATERFIELD: Do? We do nothing.
怎么办？什么也不办

92
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:49,225
PERRY: Oh, right.
哦, 好的

93
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:55,115
WATERFIELD: Nothing, except wait.
什么也不做, 就是等着

94
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:04,866
DOCTOR: This is his car. He must be around here somewhere.

WATERFIELD: You sure you weren't followed?
你肯定你没有被跟踪吗？

96
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:32,236

what this little caper's about yet, uh, Kennedy.
没有, 当然没有。嘿, 你还没有告诉我这一切到底是怎么回事, Kennedy

BOB: No, not yet.
没, 还没呢

99
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:42,875
KENNEDY: Or do you think I made a mistake giving ya two-fifty
instead of seventy-five? We thought you might like a little extra.
或许你认为我搞错了, 你说要75, 我却给了你250？我们是想你可以多拿一点

100
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:43,810
BOB: What for?
为什么？

101
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:45,162

105
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:51,968
KENNEDY: We'll be ready for them, won't we? That's what the extra's for.
但我们得做点准备, 对吧。多给你的钱就为了这

KENNEDY: Now listen...
现在听着

107
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:58,001

奇怪, 为什么付钱让他帮忙偷走 TARDIS, 又来砸他的头？

122
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:57,537
JAMIE: Well, why steal the TARDIS anyway?
到底为什么要偷 TARDIS 呢？

123
00:08:57,883 --> 00:08:59,646
DOCTOR: That's what's been bothering me, Jamie, too.
这事儿我也想不清楚, Jamie

124
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:03,497
JAMIE: There's no water here. Hey, that looks a lot of money, Doctor.
这里没有水, 嘿, 这里看来有一大笔钱, 博士

125
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:06,022
DOCTOR: It's between two and three hundred pounds.
大概200多镑, 300不到。

126
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:09,022
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a lot, at least for what he had to do
这的确不少, 对于要他干的事情来说不少

127
00:09:09,223 --> 00:09:13,022
DOCTOR: - put on a pair of overalls and just hang around.
—— 也就是穿上工作服晃悠两下

128
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:18,022
JAMIE: Come to think of it, why hang around? He was obviously planted.
Why not just go off in the lorry?
你想想, 为什么要晃悠？他显然是被安插下来的。为什么不跟着货车一起跑掉呢？

129
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:19,864
JAMIE: You found something else?
你找到了什么吗？

130
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:21,010
DOCTOR: I don't know.
我不知道

131
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:36,515
DOCTOR: Yes, this man rolled his own cigarettes, so these
must belong to somebody else. That's a fair assumption.
是了, 这个是自己卷烟抽的, 所以这里肯定还有别的人。这是一个合理的假设

132
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:38,710
JAMIE: What's that?
那是什么？

133
00:09:38,922 --> 00:09:40,201
DOCTOR: It's all right. It's only a train.
没事, 那是火车的声音

134
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:41,126
JAMIE: A what?
什么？

135
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:46,063
DOCTOR: Well, it's a train. There are carriages and
they go on wheels, on rails, and they're drawn by a stea...
嗯, 是火车。上面有车厢, 下面有轮子, 跑在铁轨上, 它们是靠蒸汽牵引着。。。

136
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:47,217
DOCTOR: Hey, come back!
嘿, 回来！

137
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:55,658
Well, give us a hand!
来, 搭把手

138
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:03,470
- DOCTOR: Aw, not a sign of him.
- JAMIE: The only chance we had.
- 啊, 不见踪影了  - 我们唯一的机会

139
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:05,158
DOCTOR: There is this...
还有这个。。。

140
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:11,230
DOCTOR: "The Tricolour". It's a coffee bar apparently. And that's not all.
”三原色“。这看起来是一个咖啡馆。这还不是全部

141
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,477
JAMIE: Well, what else?
还有什么？

142
00:10:12,664 --> 00:10:16,502
DOCTOR: Well, normally people pull out their matches from right to left.
These have been torn out from left to right.
看这个, 一般来说人们都是从右往左抽火柴。但这些是从左到右的

143
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:17,786
JAMIE: What does that mean?
这说明什么？

144
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:27,788
DOCTOR: It means we've got to find a coffee bar called "The Tricolour"
and look for a man called Ken or Kenneth - someone who's left-handed.
这说明我们要去一个叫做”三原色“的咖啡馆, 找寻一个叫做 Ken 或者 Kenneth 的人, 这人还是个左撇子

145
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:29,308
JAMIE: Now we've got something to go on!
现在我们找到地方继续

146
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:37,387
DOCTOR: But it's so little, Jamie. It's too little. He might only
have been there once. There's no guarantee he'll ever go there again.
机会还比较小, Jamie, 或者说非常小。他可能只去过那个地方一次, 不敢说他还会再去那里

147
00:10:37,548 --> 00:10:40,722
JAMIE: Now, don't give up Doctor. Remember Bruce.
别放弃, 博士。记得 Bruce 吗？

148
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:42,121
DOCTOR: Bruce?
哪个 Bruce？

149
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:43,574
JAMIE: Robert Bruce.
<i>（注：苏格兰独立运动领袖, 独立后的苏格兰国王罗伯特一世）</i>

150
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:55,180
KENNEDY: Look, I told...
看, 我跟你说过...

151
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,540
WATERFIELD: They were not aware that you were watching?
他们没有发现你在监视吗？

152
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,189
KENNEDY: No, they were too busy trying to work it all out.
没有, 他们一直忙着搞明白问题

153
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,179
WATERFIELD: Good.
很好

154
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:04,398
KENNEDY: That Bob Hall was a bit of a problem. I didn't think he'd turn nasty.
那个 Bob Hall 有点麻烦。我没想到他会变得棘手

155
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,697
WATERFIELD: You didn't hurt him?
你没有伤害他吧？

156
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,521
KENNEDY: Him? You're joking.
他？你开玩笑吧

157
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:10,298
WATERFIELD: I can assure you that I am not.
我可以保证我没有

158
00:11:10,488 --> 00:11:14,892
KENNEDY: He's a lot bigger than me, you know.
No, I just baggered him one and that was it.
他比我快头大, 你知道的。没有, 我只是打了他一下, 仅此而已

159
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:20,047
WATERFIELD: That was what? Kennedy, I must know precisely
what has happened. How badly injured was Hall?
仅此而已？ Kennedy, 我必须知道到底发生了什么。Hall 伤得严重不？

160
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:24,367
KENNEDY: Well, a bit dazed, that's all. He just mumbled something
and made a run for it when they weren't looking.
就是有点晕了, 仅此而已。他嘟哝了几句什么, 然后趁他们没看见就跑了

161
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,745
WATERFIELD: And where is he now?
那他现在在哪儿？

162
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:32,301
KENNEDY: Well, I went round to his place later. There he was coming
out the front door, zip bag and everything. He got in a cab and went to Euston.
嗯, 我后来去了他的地方。他正从前门出来, 打包好了一切, 坐进一辆车, 去了 Euston 

163
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:35,120
WATERFIELD: Were you able to find another hansom and follow him?
你就不能找个什么人跟着他吗？

164
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,159
KENNEDY: Eh?
嗯？

165
00:11:36,469 --> 00:11:37,817
WATERFIELD: Did you follow him?
你跟踪他了？

166
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,914
KENNEDY: Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about him. He's gone up north.
好了, 好了, 别担心他了, 他去北方了

167
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:48,168
WATERFIELD: That disposes of that. Now, this is extremely important:
you did leave the matches?
那就估计没问题了。现在, 这个问题非常重要：你的确留下火柴了吗？

168
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:51,838
KENNEDY: Don't worry about it. The Doctor found the cigarettes and the matches.
别担心这个, 博士已经发现了烟卷和火柴

169
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:55,115
WATERFIELD: And you are certain they were the ones bearing the name of the coffee shop?
你确定就是带有咖啡店名称的那盒？

170
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,000
KENNEDY: Coffee bar.
咖啡馆

171
00:11:56,243 --> 00:11:56,760
WATERFIELD: Yes.
对

172
00:11:57,013 --> 00:12:02,449
KENNEDY: Yes. I told you, it worked like a charm. I never thought it would,
but you were quite right. He got onto the name on the matches straight away.
就是, 我跟你说, 进展非常顺利, 我都没想到。不过你是对的, 他直接就注意到了火柴上面的名字

173
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:16,610
WATERFIELD: Well, just one last thing, to make quite sure:
now you are certain that these are the people that you saw?
好, 最后一件事, 我得确认一下：你看看, 你确认他们就是这两个人？

174
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:19,356
KENNEDY: That's them, yeah. Yeah, definite.
就是他们, 对的, 对的, 绝对

175
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:27,056
WATERFIELD: Right. Well, I shall want you to keep out of sight.
You'd better stay in the house, and on no account are you to
talk to Mr. Perry about any of this.
好。现在, 你先躲起来, 最好不要出门。也绝对不要跟 Perry 谈起这件事

176
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:27,889
KENNEDY: OK.
好吧

177
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:30,357
WATERFIELD: "OK."? What does that mean?
好吧？这什么意思？

178
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,174
KENNEDY: What? Yes!
什么? 好的！

179
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:38,714
WATERFIELD: Oh, I know that my attitude may appear strange to you on occasions, Kennedy.
哦, 我知道有时候我的态度会显得比较奇怪, Kennedy

180
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:44,308
KENNEDY: You want to play the part of the Victorian grandfather,
that's all right by me. Must be a pretty good gimmick. You pay me well enough.
你想要扮演维多利亚老爷爷, 这跟完全没关系。你这肯定是一个相当不错的局。不过你给我的报酬相当不错

181
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:47,331
WATERFIELD: It, uh... helps to sell to our customers.
这对我们的生意有帮助 fixme

182
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:54,934
KENNEDY: Yeah, sure, sure. You've, uh... never told me
what it is exactly you've got against this Doctor and his friend.
对, 当然, 当然。你从来。。没有告诉过我, 你对博士和他的朋友有什么打算。

183
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:57,934
KENNEDY: Some kind of vendetta or something?
是复仇什么的吗？

184
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:02,779
WATERFIELD: Explanations are not part of our arrangement.
我并没有必要向你解释 fixme

185
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:04,308
KENNEDY: Oh, just wondering.
哦, 只是好奇

186
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,856
WATERFIELD: Imagination is a virtue, but it can become a vice.
想象力是个优点, 但也可能变成缺点

187
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:09,510
KENNEDY: Mind me own business, yeah. I get the message.
管好我自己的事, 好, 我知道了

188
00:13:09,786 --> 00:13:12,268
WATERFIELD: Ask Mr. Perry to come and see me, will you, please?
让 Perry 先生过来见我, 帮忙叫一下？

189
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:09,790
KENNEDY: He wants to see you.
他想要见你

190
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:11,176
PERRY: Oh, thank you.
哦, 谢谢你

191
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:14,886
WATERFIELD: Who is it?
谁？

192
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:16,576
PERRY: It's Perry, sir.
是 Perry, 先生

193
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:17,822
WATERFIELD: One moment.
等一下

194
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:23,014
PERRY: You wanted to see me, sir?
你想要见我, 先生？

195
00:14:23,616 --> 00:14:28,860
WATERFIELD: Yes, I have an extremely important and delicate task
for you to perform.
是的, 我有一个非常重要、非常棘手的任务, 需要你去办

196
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:29,905
PERRY: Oh, yes?
哦, 是什么？

197
00:14:30,273 --> 00:14:32,753
PERRY: I say, you got a new delivery.
咦, 你又有新货啦

198
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:34,521
WATERFIELD: Y... yes.
是。。是的

199
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:36,202
PERRY: I didn't see it arrive.
但我没有看到它送过来

200
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:43,022
WATERFIELD: It was delivered last night. I've only just
brought it in myself. It is, uh... for a new customer.
它是昨晚投递的, 我自己把它拿进来的。那是。。。那是给一个新客户的

201
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:44,173
PERRY: Oh, yes?
哦, 是吗？

202
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:48,609
WATERFIELD: A Dr. Galloway. He's extremely wealthy and an ardent collector...
某位 Galloway 博士, 他相当富有, 非常喜欢收藏

203
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,517
PERRY: Of, uh... Victoriana, sir?
当然。。。维多利亚迷, 是吗？

204
00:14:50,676 --> 00:14:57,750
WATERFIELD: No less. I do not know the Doctor personally,
but we have arranged to meet in the coffee shop, uh... bar, nearby.
的确。我个人也不认识这位博士, 但我们约好了在附近的咖啡店, 哦, 咖啡馆, 见面

205
00:14:57,907 --> 00:14:59,520
PERRY: Oh, the Tricolour, sir?
哦, 三原色, 是吗？

206
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:06,450
WATERFIELD: Yes. Unfortunately, I am unable to keep the appointment,
so I want you to go instead, Mr. Perry.
是的, 但不幸的是, 我没法赴约了。所以我想你替我去, Perry 先生。

207
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:10,450
WATERFIELD: Here is a photograph of Dr. Galloway.
这里有 Galloway 博士的照片

208
00:15:10,936 --> 00:15:15,835
WATERFIELD: This is his assistant and secretary, Mr. James McCrimmon.
这是他的助手和秘书, James McCrimmon 先生.

209
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:21,135
WATERFIELD: Now I want you to ask the Doctor to come
to the shop tonight, say at, uh... ten o' clock.
我想让你请博士晚上到店里来, 大概。。10点

210
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,464
PERRY: Ten o'clock, sir?!
十点, 先生？

211
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:28,363
WATERFIELD: Yes. Oh, don't worry, Mr. Perry.
I shall be attending to him myself. You needn't wait.
是的。哦, 别担心, Perry 先生。我自己招待他, 你不用在这里等着

212
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:29,757
PERRY: Oh, right sir.
哦, 好的, 先生

213
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:36,781
WATERFIELD: The Doctor is notoriously unpunctual.
I fear you may have a long and tedious wait.
这位博士是出了名的不准时。恐怕你得多等一会儿了

214
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:38,958
PERRY: I shall find him sir. Do you want me to go now?
我会找到他的, 先生。你想让我现在就去吗？

215
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,446
WATERFIELD: If you please, Mr. Perry.
如果你愿意的话, Perry 先生

216
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,349
PERRY: Right.
好的

217
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:33,988
PERRY: And what are you doing?
你在这里干什么？

218
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:35,781
KENNEDY: I... I can't make Mr. Waterfield hear me. I knocked.
我。。。刚才 Waterfield 先生听不见我说话。 我敲门了

219
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:36,718
PERRY: He's busy.
他正忙

220
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:37,947
KENNEDY: O.K. I'll try later.
好吧, 那我稍后再来

221
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:58,028
JAMIE: Don't look so depressed, Doctor.
别这么丧气, 博士

222
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,769
DOCTOR: If only we knew what he looked like, Jamie.
我们要是知道他长什么样子就好了, Jamie

223
00:17:01,016 --> 00:17:03,450
JAMIE: We'll ask one of the lasses in a moment, when things get quieter.
我们一会儿问问某个女人, 要是还没什么头绪

224
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:06,444
DOCTOR: We've got to untangle this, you know.
我们得解开这个谜题，是吧

225
00:17:06,645 --> 00:17:11,470
JAMIE: It's all quite obvious to me. They're just robbers.
Thieves, you understand.
对我而言，这非常明显, 他们就是抢劫犯, 小偷, 你明白吗？

226
00:17:11,684 --> 00:17:17,058
DOCTOR: No, no, there's more to it than that.
Why leave that man in the hangar to give us a clue?
不, 不, 这事没那么简单。为什么要在机库留一个人给我们留下线索呢？

227
00:17:17,254 --> 00:17:19,597
JAMIE: Which we haven't followed up, you know. "Leatherman?"
我们并没有跟着那条线索啊, 记得吗, ”Leatherman"

228
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:25,580
DOCTOR: There is no delivery firm of that name.
Not in the London area, anyway. I checked in the phone book.
没有哪个送货公司叫那个名字, 至少伦敦地区没有。我查过电话本了

229
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:27,653
JAMIE: But surely there's more places than London.
但显然不止伦敦这一个地方啊

230
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:28,703
DOCTOR: Maybe.
也许吧

231
00:17:30,856 --> 00:17:32,622
JAMIE: Do you think this is sort of a trap, Doctor?
你觉得这是某种陷阱, 博士？

232
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:36,025
DOCTOR: Yes, but if only we knew who our enemies are...
是的, 要是我们知道我们的敌人是谁就好了。。。

233
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:37,941
Not the Chameleons again!
不会又是变色龙吧？
<i>（注：在上一集04x08 The Faceless Ones出现的）</i>

234
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:43,893
DOCTOR: No, something else. I can feel them, closing in all around us.
不, 是其他的。我能感觉到, 就在我们旁边不远的地方
