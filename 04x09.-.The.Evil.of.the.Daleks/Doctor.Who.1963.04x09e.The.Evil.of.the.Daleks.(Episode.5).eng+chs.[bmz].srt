你的手一放开, 它就没有磁性了

54
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:40,213
DOCTOR: Now, if uh...if I didn't know better, Mr. Terrall,
I'd say that you were full of some sort of electricity.
哈, 如果。。如果不是我早知道的话, Terrall 先生, 我得说你全身充满了某种电能

不, Terrall 先生。我不是人性方面的学生。

59
00:04:58,638 --> 00:05:03,414

他的手开始颤抖, 酒杯掉落, 他双眼变得呆滞, 一个声音响起。。。）</i>

Obey, obey, obey!
服从, 服从, 服从！

64
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:47,055
JAMIE: ...and so the Doctor and I were brought to the house.

那告诉我, 他们一开始是怎么抓住你的？

VICTORIA: I don't remember.
And yet, I seem to remember in the back of my mind
我记不起来了, 不过, 好像我的潜意识里面又记得

70

啊, 你被下药了, 也许？

The only thing I remember is waking up in a bare room
我就是记不得了。我唯一记得事情就是, 一醒过来就在一个空房子里面

concentrate, because I was so worried about Papa.
当时我在客厅读书, 但我就是无法集中精神, 因为我很担心我的爸爸

VICTORIA: I think I fell asleep over my book.
我想后来我是在书上面睡着了

你看, 你是怎么落入 Daleks 掌控之中的, 这一点很重要

you will go back to your room and lie down on your bed.
那就对了。现在, 当我让你睁开眼睛的时候, 你将回到你的房间去, 躺到你的床上

97

Look, Doctor, just whose side are you on?
我不知道, 你有吗？说, 博士, 你到底站在那一边？

and added to these Daleks.
都被记录下来, 注入了这个小小的正子脑, 装到这几个 Dalek 上

- to triumph over human beings.
这就是想要添加到他们自己力量之上，用来超越了人类的东西 - “人类特质”

00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,874
JAMIE: Well, how do you know they haven't succeeded?
那么，你怎么知道他们没有成功呢？

they may be, are always within reach of other human beings.
因为不管人类有多聪明, 都还总是在其他人触手可及的范围内

00:23:14,846 --> 00:23:17,881
DOCTOR: Now then, it's all right, Jamie. Don't worry.
既然这样，没事的，Jamie，不用担心

252
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:20,574
JAMIE: H... How do you know you can trust them, Doctor?
你怎么知道可以信任他们，博士？

253
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:30,598
DOCTOR: What is it? What do you want? Hmm? What are you up to?
Ah! What are you doing?
这是什么？你们想要什么？唔，你们在干什么呢？啊，你们在干什么？

254
00:23:31,055 --> 00:23:32,398
JAMIE: Doctor, where are they taking you?
博士，他们要带你去哪儿？
