One-three-seven-nine, no... Excuse me
1-3-7-9。不。。。打扰一下

141
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,623
Who the blazes are you? Get these scavengers out of here!
你是什么人？把这些流浪汉赶出这里

142
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,778
We're not scavengers!
我们不是流浪汉

143
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:55,393
Out of here!
出去！

144
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:03,652
No! In two minutes 38 seconds, you're going to have an almighty explosion! The readings say so!
不, 还有2分38秒你们就要有一场剧烈的爆炸了, 这些读数已经表明了

145
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:08,937
Well how do you possibly know that, I haven't even, I haven't even processed them through the computer yet!
呵, 你怎么可能知道这个？我都还没有, 还没有让电脑处理过这些数据

146
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,988
I don't need a computer!
我不需要一台电脑

147
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:13,122
If he's right it's already too late to escape!
如果他是对的, 那已经来不及逃走了

148
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:15,173
No it isn't, it doesn't have to happen, if you'll excuse me.
不, 不会的, 并不一定会发生, 如果你允许。。。

149
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:19,091
Cut out the reactor!
切断反应堆!

150
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,093
There's insufficient power for that.
没有足够的能量执行这个操作

151
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:26,928
Well a quick short burst then from the reactor unit, now.
那就从反应器单元接一个短脉冲过来, 快

152
00:11:27,842 --> 00:11:28,522
Off!
切断!

153
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,450
Now link the circuit, with the reactor link.
现在接通回路, 用反应器连接

154
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:35,760
Now, bring in the computer stabiliser.
现在, 把电脑稳定器接进来

155
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:49,843
Yes, yes, that should hold it steady. It's a, it's not a perfect job, mind you. You ought to get an expert in, you know.
是的, 是的, 应该可以稳住了。虽然不算是非常完美。你应该搞一个专家来, 你知道吗？

156
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:56,460
How did you... It was all bluff, wasn't it, that two minutes 38 seconds to danger?
你怎么。。。你完全是在唬人吧, 是不是？ 2分38秒就要发生危险？

157
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:59,419
Oh no, it was near enough correct, give or take a second.
哦不, 很接近正确值, 误差不超过一秒。

158
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:00,660
Rubbish.
胡说

159
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:04,041
Check it on your precious computer, then.
那就用你宝贵的电脑核查一遍吧

160
00:12:05,105 --> 00:12:06,458
Miss Garrett, do so.
Garrett 小姐, 照做

161
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:19,249
loniser fall rate: seven-two point four, ion compensator: minus one-seven degrees, ion flow rate: one-three-seven-nine. Assessment please.
离子器失效率: 72.4, 离子补偿器: -17度, 离子流速: 1-3-7-9。请评估

162
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:27,776
Immediate emergency. In two minutes 37 seconds, the reactor will explode.
立刻进入紧急状态。在2分37秒内, 离子器将会爆炸

163
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,441
Well a second out. We... can't all be perfect.
啊差了一秒。。。但我们不可能那么精准

164
00:12:31,304 --> 00:12:33,244
We're at half power now, Leader Clent!
我们现在只有一半能量了, 组长 Clent

165
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:36,645
Why even Penley couldn't have done better. Where on earth did you spring from?
即便是 Penley 也不能做得更好。你到底是从哪里冒出来的

166
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:37,824
It doesn't matter, look...
这无关紧要, 你看。。。

167
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,266
Are you alright?
你没事吧？

168
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:49,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no no no no. It's nothing, it's just um, it's just an emergency _ and 10 hour duty spell.
抱歉, 抱歉, 不, 不。。。没事, 只是有点紧急。。。还有扛了10个小时的。。。

169
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,587
The vibro-chair.
按摩椅

170
00:12:51,748 --> 00:13:00,804
Yes, you're right. Um, contact the Medi-Control Centre the moment there's a further _ We'll talk at the same time, come with me.
是, 你是对的, 唔, 联系医疗中心中心。。。与此同时我们谈谈, 跟我来

171
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:04,833
Ask him where we are!
问问他我们是在哪里

172
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:07,866
A giant among prehistoric men.
一个史前的巨人

173
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,400
See the kind of armour he's got on?
看到他身上那个盔甲一样的东西没？

174
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:21,783
Yes, that's rather strange. He looks pre-Viking. But no such civilisation existed in prehistoric times before the first ice age.
看到了, 很奇怪, 他看起来像是维京人的先祖。不过在第一次冰川期并没有这样的史前文明存在啊

175
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:27,330
Ha! Proper "Ice Warrior", isn't he, Sir? I reckon Leader Clent will be interested.
哈, 叫它”寒冰勇士“怎样, 头儿？我猜组长 Clent 会感兴趣的

176
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:31,692
Yes. What'll the mighty computer make of it, eh?
是的, 那个全能的电脑会分析点什么出来的, 是吧？

177
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:34,813
Sir, hadn't we better get back while the weather still holds?
头儿, 天气一直这样的话, 我们最好还是回去吧

178
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:39,185
Good point Walters. Davis, try bringing the air-sled a little closer, will you?
说得对, Walters. Davis 你去把气垫雪撬拿近一点, 好吗

179
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:48,644
What are they up to?
他们要去干什么

180
00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:56,338
Arden's found something in the ice. Something to take back to Clent. It won't be appreciated.
Arden 在冰里面发现了什么东西, 要带回到 Clent 那里。不会得到表扬的

181
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,497
Ar, they ought to leave way alone.
他们应该别管这个

182
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:01,962
Arden was always a researcher. He wanted to be an archaeologist when I knew him.
Arden 始终还是一个学究, 我认识他的时候他就想当一个考古学家

183
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:04,452
Archaeology. What good's that?
考古学家, 那有什么好的？

184
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:06,845
It's good to know things, even when they're dead.
可以搞明白一些事情很帮啊, 即使是死了

185
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:09,215
Nothing's sacred to you, is it?
对你们而言没什么是神圣的吗

186
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:12,348
I only ask questions, it's in my character I suppose.
我只是不断提问题, 我想这是我的天性

187
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,663
Ar, you swore you'd give all that up.
啊, 你发誓你会放弃那个的

188
00:14:15,398 --> 00:14:25,044
Discovery's as exciting to me as the hunt is to you. But with Clent, he uses scientists' craniums as stepping stones for his ambitions.
科学发现对于我来说是很激动人性的, 正如打猎对于你一样。不过对于 Clent, 他用科学家的头盖骨作为自己野心的垫脚石

189
00:14:25,254 --> 00:14:27,420
Ar, that's about all you lot are fit for...
啊, 那就是你们这些家伙为什么适合。。。

190
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:30,039
Well we're not totally useless, surely?
我们也不是完全一无是处, 是吧

191
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:35,545
To me you are. Come on, we've got to move. Leave them to... stupid games.
对我来说, 你是的。来, 我们得走了。把这些。。。愚蠢的游戏留给他们吧

192
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:01,009
Avalanche! Come on!
雪崩了！快！

193
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:01,925
Where's Davis?
Davis 哪儿去啦？

194
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:05,681
Storr! Come on! Avalanche!
Storr 快过来, 雪崩了！

195
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:21,900
Storr, are you alright?
Storr 你没事吧

196
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:22,757
Penley...
Penley...

197
00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:23,771
What's the damage?
哪里出问题了？

198
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:28,773
My arm. It's gone I think.
我的胳膊, 我估计断了

199
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:29,791
Broken?
断了？

200
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:31,421
Feels like it.
感觉像是

201
00:15:31,617 --> 00:15:35,181
Well you're lucky. There's one down there who's staying on the mountain for good.
啊, 你很幸运。有个家伙掉下去了, 只能长眠在山里了

202
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:43,872
They'll... they'll come looking for him. We must move out a bit. Unless you fancy trying to turn me over to your friends.
他们会。。。他们会来找他的。我们得往外面移一点。除非你情愿把我交给你的朋友们(?)

203
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:47,860
Six weeks ago they were my friends, but not anymore. Can you walk?
六个星期以前他们是我的朋友, 但已经不再是了。 你能走吗？

204
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:52,074
Aye. Just you try and keep up. Come on.
能吧, 你试试, 扶我起来, 来

205
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,244
All clear, Sir.
过去了, 头儿

206
00:15:55,464 --> 00:15:56,625
Yes, but how 'bout Davis?
嗯, 但 Davis 呢？

207
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,687
I'll go look for him.
我去找他

208
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,340
Well let's hope he's safe. With another man gone, Clent'll skin me alive.
最好他安然无恙。要是又损失一个人, Clent 会活剥了我的

209
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:05,977
Well if he gets too difficult, you can always set your warrior on him, eh Sir?
哈如果他再找麻烦, 你可以打开你的寒冰勇士对付他, 对吧头儿？哈哈哈

210
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,524
But you've no valid proof of your qualifications?
但你没有什么材料证明你的资格吗？

211
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:11,898
Look, aren't we wasting time?
你看, 我们是不是在浪费时间？

212
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:15,447
If you want our help, why not tell us all about it?
如果你想要我们的帮助, 为什么不将所有情况都告诉我们呢？

213
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:19,056
All about it? All about what? Where have you been all these years?
所有情况？什么所有情况？你这些年都在哪里呢？

214
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:28,020
Well, er, as a matter of fact, we've, we've been in retreat. In, in Tibet. We are sanctifiers.
哦, 这个, 事实上呢, 我们撤退了, 到了西藏, 我们朝圣去了

215
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:38,354
Oh, I see. In Tibet. Well if you'll take a simple test, I'll soon know if you're up to our scientific standards.
哦, 明白了。去西藏了。这样, 如果你接受一个简单的测试, 我就很快能知道你是否能满足我们的科学标准

216
00:16:38,526 --> 00:16:41,046
I see, and er, if I fail?
我明白了, 要是我没通过呢？

217
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:44,778
You'll be evacuated with the other scavengers in due course.
你会跟其它流浪汉一起疏散走的

218
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:46,039
Oh, where to?
哦, 去哪儿？

219
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:48,527
The African rehabilitation centres, of course.
当然是非洲定居点

220
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:50,317
Oh no, not Africa.
哦, 不要, 不去非洲

221
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,022
Very well, fire away.
那好吧, 发招吧

222
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:55,649
I present you a problem.
我给你一个难题

223
00:16:55,842 --> 00:16:56,493
Yes.
好

224
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,263
All the major continents are threatened with destruction, under the glaciers of the second ice age.
所有的大陆都面临着碎掉的威胁, 因为第二次冰河世纪的冰山

225
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,300
Oh.
哦

226
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:09,053
How would you halt the ice surge, and turn the climate back to normal? 45 seconds, starting from... now.
你打算如何阻止冰山涌来, 把气温转回正常？45秒, 从现在。。。开始

227
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:15,071
Oh, er, ahem, er, possible causes, er, the reversal of the magnetic field.
哦, 嗯, 可能的原因是, 呃, 地球磁场反转了

228
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:16,816
No such change has occurred.
没有发生这样的事情

229
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:21,245
Um, interstellar clouds, er, obscuring the suns rays.
唔, 星际云层, 额, 遮挡了太阳光

230
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:26,222
An excessive burst of sunspot activity.
太阳活动突然爆发

231
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:32,819
A severe shift of the Earth's angle of rotation.
地球倾角发生了巨大偏转

232
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:34,609
Come on Doctor.
加油, 博士

233
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:39,073
There aren't that many alternatives. Gigantic heat loss, eh? Er.
并没有太多可能啊。巨额的热量流失, 嗯？呃

234
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:43,384
I asked for an answer, not a question. Twelve seconds left.
我要的是答案, 不是问题。只剩20秒了

235
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:51,969
Oh. Er. Oh well. Ahem. In that case the answer's simple. A severe drop in the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's lower atmosphere. Is that it?
哦, 呃, 好了, 嗯, 这样的话答案就很简单了。在地球大气层的下层突然二氧化碳的量急剧降低, 是这个不

236
00:17:53,595 --> 00:18:03,000
<i>翻译备注: ionisation 这个词语本来是指”电离“, 但剧里只是借了这个词, 跟”电离“没有半点关系, 所以翻译为”离子化“</i>

237
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:55,526
I would use ionisation.
我会采用离子化手段

238
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:58,063
Well, is he right?
诶, 他对了没？

239
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,382
Yes, he is.
是的, 他对了

240
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:03,292
But I still don't understand.
但我还是不明白

241
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:11,136
Well the carbon dioxide level in the Earth's atmosphere helps retain the suns heat. Take that gas away, and there's a sudden freeze up.
地球大气中的二氧化碳会有助于让地球保持从太阳得到的热量。如果这种气体没了, 就会陡然冷下来

242
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:12,879
Oh, where does the gas go to?
哦, 那些气体去哪儿了

243
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:13,670
Well...
这个就。。。

244
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:17,809
You know how efficient our civilisation is, thanks to the direction of the great world computer.
你知道我们的文明是如何有效率的, 这要感谢伟大的世界级电脑给出的方向

245
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:22,239
And you also know how we conquered the problem of world famine a century ago by artificial food.
而且你也知道我们如何在一个世纪前用人工食物征服了粮食不足的问题

246
00:18:22,472 --> 00:18:28,809
On the land that was once used to grow the food we needed, we built up-to-date living units, to house the ever-increasing population.
在那些以前用来种植粮食的土地上, 我们建立了一些新型的房子, 以让日益增加的人口有地方住

247
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:30,657
Up to date?
新型的？

248
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:35,537
Well there were exceptions, of course. I mean this house was classified as being historic interest.
这里有一些例外, 不可避免的。我是说这些房子是分类的, 由于一些历史上原因。

249
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:42,137
So, the amount of growing plants on the planet, was reduced to an absolute minimum.
于是, 这个星球上生长的作物, 总量就降低了历史最低点

250
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:44,835
No plants, no carbon dioxide.
没有植物, 就没有二氧化碳

251
00:18:45,264 --> 00:18:49,317
Then suddenly, one year, there was no spring.
然后突然, 某一年, 就没有了春天

252
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,549
Even then it wasn't understood. Not until the ice-caps began to advance.
即使那时我们也还没明白, 直到冰山开始推进

253
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,964
Er, but er, what's this ioniser?
呃, 但是, 这个离子器是什么

254
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:03,903
Um, Miss Garrett.
唔, Garrett 小姐

255
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:11,120
lonisation is a method of intensifying the suns heat onto the Earth, but into particular areas.
离子化是一种增强太阳光能量的方法, 用在地球上特定地区

256
00:19:11,459 --> 00:19:14,130
Yeah, it's like a magnifying glass, Jamie.
是的, 就像放大镜一样, Jamie

257
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:15,100
Oh, aye.
哦, 是

258
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,965
You mean you can melt glaciers and change the weather?
你的意思是你可以融化冰川, 改变气候？

259
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:21,331
Um, when certain difficulties are overcome.
嗯, 只要某些困难得以解决

260
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:23,374
Precise control is not easy.
精细控制并不容易

261
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:28,367
We can't afford to make mistakes. lonisation can produce temperatures intense enough to melt rock.
我们负担不起犯错误的代价的。离子化可以产生足够高的温度，石头都可以溶掉

262
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,169
Only by maintaining a perfect balance can we prevent widespread flooding.
但只有维持一个绝妙的平衡, 我们才可能不被洪水淹没

263
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:35,414
Can't your computers solve the problem of control?
你的电脑能够解决控制的问题吗？

264
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,150
Of course they can!
它们当然能

265
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:38,301
Well?
哦？

266
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,932
When the input data is complete they will give us the solution.
只要输入的数据是完整的, 它们就能给出解决方案

267
00:19:41,023 --> 00:19:43,341
Oh, I see. And when will that be?
哦, 明白了。估计是什么时候？

268
00:19:43,504 --> 00:19:45,211
Soon Doctor, soon.
快了, 博士, 快了

269
00:19:45,496 --> 00:19:46,962
What's the position now?
现在处于什么位置？

270
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:53,041
Well we're barely holding the glacier in check. Now there you see a world map of the situation at the moment.
我们勉强遏制住了冰川。现在你可以看到一幅当前的世界地图

271
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:05,398
And there you see what's, erm, going on in our sector. But if we fail, then not only will Europe be swallowed up,
在这里你可以看到, 在我们这个区域正在发生的情况。如果我们失败, 不仅仅欧洲会被吞掉

272
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,398
but the balance of power will be ruined, and the whole world program will, will go under.
而且力量会失去平衡, 整个世界的计划就泡汤了。。。

273
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,811
And the glaciers will win.
然后冰山就胜利了

274
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:23,224
My senior scientist Penley, is missing. I think you have the capabilities to join us here. This great mission. Will you help us?
我的高级科学家 Penley , 消失了。我觉得你有这个能力加入我们, 加入这个伟大的任务。你会帮我们吗？

275
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:25,409
Well I, I'm willing to try.
好, 我愿意试试

276
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:32,352
Jolly good. Jolly good. Er, Miss Garrett will give you some background information. You've worked with computers, I presume?
太好了, 太好了。额, Garrett 会给你一些背景信息。你用过电脑吧, 我猜？

277
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:33,846
Er, only when I have to.
呃, 只是需要的时候

278
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:36,358
Well Miss Garrett is our computer specialist, she'll help you.
那好 Garrett 小姐是我们的电脑专家, 她会帮助你的

279
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:38,321
Oh, I'll try and remember that.
哦, 我会试试, 记住了

280
00:20:38,658 --> 00:20:40,857
Here we are completely computerised.
我们这里已经完全电脑化了

281
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:42,349
Oh never mind.
哦, 别提这个

282
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:50,929
Every decision is checked, to eliminate risk of failure.
Because of course, all decisions, all actions, must conform to the common good.
每个决策都要核查, 以消除可能失败的风险。
因为所有决策, 所有行动, 当然必须要符合大多数人的利益

283
00:20:53,194 --> 00:20:55,842
This way, gentlemen, this way. Right.
这边, 先生们, 这边。对了

284
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:07,009
Now do be careful. 'Round here. Steady with her.
现在请小心点, 转角, 稳住

285
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:16,122
Is this... your full co-operation, Arden? How do you expect us to carry out this...
这。。就是你的全面合作，Arden？你怎么能指望我们能。。。

286
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:19,095
Great heavens.
老天啊

287
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:22,421
Yes, I thought you'd be impressed Clent.
Right chaps, lets have him over here...
是的我想你会印象深刻的，Clent。来小伙子们，我们把他停在这儿。。。

288
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:28,486
This way, this way...
这边，这边。。。

289
00:21:29,116 --> 00:21:29,900
What is it?
这是什么？

290
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,199
It looks like a Viking warrior. Look at the helmet.
看起来像是一个维京战士，看看这个头盔

291
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:38,638
Frozen for centuries in the ice. Perfectly preserved. Hm, that's odd though.
在冰里冻了好多个世纪。保存得相当完好。唔，这有点奇怪

292
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,944
What? Who are you?
干什么，你是谁？

293
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,948
An addition to our staff, Arden. What's odd Doctor?
我们团队新增的一员，Arden。有什么奇怪的吗，博士？

294
00:21:43,116 --> 00:21:47,352
Well the helmet, it's wrong. When this man was frozen to death only primitive cavemen existed.
哦这个头盔，不对劲。这个人被冻死的时候，只应该有初等的穴居人存在

295
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:51,486
Well I say it's an undiscovered civilisation. Think of the implications!
我就说是一个从未被发现的文明吧。想想这隐含的是什么！

296
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:59,284
Well whatever the implications, it must still take second place to out ioniser project.
We have our daily planning conference in three minutes fifteen seconds, exactly.
不管这隐含的是什么，它也得让道于我们的离子器项目。我们还有3分钟就要开每日进展会议了，确切地说，3分15秒

297
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:04,055
Come along Arden! Play with your toy after the meeting.
过来 Arden ，开完会再来玩你的玩具吧

298
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:09,930
Well, what's supposed to happen, Doctor?
接下来可能发生什么，博士？

299
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:14,659
You see this fellow Arden has set the electricity so that the ice melts very slowly, allowing for the resistance.
你看，Arden 这个家伙设定了低电压，以让这些冰融化得很慢，这也带来了阻抗(?)

300
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:16,082
It's working quite quickly.
但它化得很快

301
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:19,119
Well, I suspect there are some impurities in the ice. I say.
哦，我怀疑冰里面有一些杂质

302
00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:24,683
Look at that.
看那个

303
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,127
What is it?
是什么

304
00:22:27,297 --> 00:22:31,364
It's an electronic connection. I'm sure of it.
是个电路连接，我敢肯定

305
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,931
It can't be.
不可能

306
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:39,650
Now you wait here, and, and don't touch anything.
你们先在这里等着，并且，并且什么都不要碰

307
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,017
What's got into him all of a sudden?
他突然这是怎么了

308
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:48,016
I don't know. Scientists are all alike, eureka and all that.
我不知道，科学家都差不多，一惊一乍的

309
00:22:48,188 --> 00:22:49,859
Aye. Could do with a go on this, maybe.
是啊．(?)

310
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:54,423
Er, Victoria.
呃，Victoria

311
00:22:54,704 --> 00:22:55,449
What?
什么？

312
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,868
You see how those lassies were dressed?
你看见这里的女士们都是怎么穿着的吗？

313
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,993
Yes I did. And trust you to think of something like that.
是的我看见了，知道你会想这样的问题

314
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:04,093
What? Couldn't help thinking about it.
什么？忍不住就会想这个问题

315
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:07,744
Well I think it's disgusting, wearing that kind of thing.
诶，我觉得恶心，戴着那样的东西

316
00:23:08,234 --> 00:23:14,145
Oh, aye, so it is, so it is. You er, you don't see yourself dressed like that then?
哦，是这样，是这样。你，你不想看看自己穿上那样是什么样子？

317
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:14,943
Jamie!

318
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:17,149
Oh, I'm sorry, it was just an idea.
哦，抱歉，只是个想法而已

319
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:21,343
We will now change the subject, please. I want to look at this man.
我们谈点别的吧，求你了。我想看看这个家伙
