VARGA: See, it is working. Zondal is coming to life. Zondal. Zondal. Zondal.
看, 起作用了。Zondal就要醒过来了, Zondal, Zondal, Zondal

8
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:31,343
JAMIE: Wish me luck, Doctor.
祝我好运, 博士

9
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:37,940
DOCTOR: You take care of yourself, Jamie, and keep an eye on Arden. I don't think he quite realises how dangerous this creature is.
你自己小心, Jamie, 盯着点Arden。我觉得他不清楚这生物有多危险

10
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:40,689
JAMIE: After what's happened here? He must be blind.
不是刚有人被袭击了吗？他要不知道就太瞎了

11
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:44,240
DOCTOR: Well, he's a scientist and a bit inclined to have his head in the air. You know what they're like.
哦, 他是个科学家, 有点一头扎在空气中。你知道他们是什么样的

12
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,750
JAMIE: Aye, I certainly do.
是的, 我当然知道

13
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,390
ARDEN: Are you all ready, lad?
你都准备好了吗, 小伙子？

14
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,461
JAMIE: Aye, let's away.
是, 我们走吧

15
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,180
DOCTOR: Good luck.
好运

16
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,781
ARDEN: Now we don't know how many of them there are, so we'll have to tread carefully.
既然我们也不清楚他们到底有多少, 我们必须得小心应对

17
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:56,159
CLENT: You will not expose yourself to any unnecessary violence, Arden?
不到万不得已不要采取极端手段, 你不会的吧, Arden？

18
00:01:56,208 --> 00:02:00,841
ARDEN: Now listen, Clent, we both know that I'm responsible for what has happened.
现在听着, Clent, 我们都知道对于所发生的事情我是负有责任的。

19
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:07,841
If I hadn't brought that creature back here in the first place, none of this would have occurred. I also caused the death of Davis. I can't forget that, either.
如果不是我一开始把那个生物带回这里来, 这些事情都不会发生。是我造成了Davis的不幸, 我不会忘记的

20
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:15,217
CLENT: Well, you just remember your mission, that's all. And no wild sorties after the girl. It's vital that you get your information back to us immediately.
好, 你就记住你的任务就行了。不要被那个女孩儿的事情纠缠住。一有信息就马上返回才是最重要的

21
00:02:15,758 --> 00:02:19,489
JAMIE: Look, we'll not leave Victoria to the warriors, if that's what you mean. If there's half a chance of us two
听着, 我们不会把 Victoria 留给那些勇士。如果你是这个意思, 我们俩半点机会也没有

22
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:25,099
CLENT: You will take your orders from Scientist Arden! Act according to your priorities, Arden.
你要听从科学家Arden的命令！ 你也得做出带队者的样子, Arden

23
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:26,089
ARDEN: Come along, boy.
来吧, 孩子

24
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:26,989
CLENT: Arden?
Arden?

25
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:27,589
ARDEN: Yes?
怎么?

26
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:37,825
CLENT: Don't be to too hard on yourself. Scientists must question, you know.
别对自己太苛刻了。科学家负责提出问题的, 你知道的。

27
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:42,825
I mean, if I'd been in your shoes I think I'd have done the same.
我的意思是, 如果当时是我, 我也会做同样的事情。

28
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:49,825
I'd have, I'd have brought it back. So, anyway, good luck.
我一样也会把它带回来。所以,不管怎样, 祝你好

29
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:51,676
DOCTOR: Good luck, Jamie!
好运, Jamie

30
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:52,267
JAMIE: And you, Doctor.
你也是, 博士

31
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:57,393
CLENT: Well, Doctor, let's see you go into action. I'll just get Miss Garrett to take you over the set-up here.
对了, 博士, 你也开始动手吧。我会让 Garrett 小姐帮你把这里准备好

32
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:02,261
DOCTOR: Miss Garrett? Oh, no, no. There's no need to go into formalities.
Garrett小姐？不用, 不用, 不用这么麻烦

33
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:06,363
CLENT: Miss Garrett? I like things done properly. Where is she?
Garrett小姐呢？我想这件事赶紧完成, 她去哪儿了

34
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:12,841
DOCTOR: Now Clent, just remember I am not a member of your staff. I'm just a working guest, as you might say.
Clent, 你得记住，我不是你团队中的一员。我只是临时来帮忙的就是了

35
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:15,673
CLENT: Yes, of course. But this is a formal establishment, and our regulations
是的, 当然。但这里的建设是正式的, 还有章程

36
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:20,543
DOCTOR: Your regulations do not apply to me. I work in my own way, freely.
你的章程对我不起作用, 我按我自己的方式来做。

37
00:03:22,093 --> 00:03:28,883
CLENT: I see. Like Penley. Regulations seemed to bother him, too. Probably caused his eventual breakdown, in fact.
明白了, 就像Penly一样。这些章程似乎很困扰他, 可能正是这个导致了他最后的崩溃

38
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:31,353
DOCTOR: Breakdown? I thought you said he defected?
崩溃？我记得你说他开小差了？

39
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:40,363
CLENT: Did I? Well, one thing lead to another, naturally. He was under a great deal of pressure. Just too much for him, that's all.
是吗？哦, 事情自然是一件接着一件。他当时顶着的压力很大, 对他来说太大了, 就这样

40
00:03:40,494 --> 00:03:41,903
DOCTOR: Oh, I see.
哦, 我明白了

41
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:47,093
STORR: A creature growing out of the ice! Bah!
冰里面出来一个怪物！切

42
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:50,864
PENLEY: I assure you that what I saw was very real. And terrifying.
我向你保证我所看见非常真实, 还很吓人

43
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:57,004
STORR: You've been out on the mountain too long. It takes some people that way. Especially the brainy ones.
你已经在山上呆得太久了, 就会让某些人出现这个, 尤其是用脑较多的人 

44
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:00,613
PENLEY: Hmmm. Very well, don't believe me, but I still intend to find out.
唔, 好吧, 你不相信我。但我还是打算去搞明白

45
00:04:02,524 --> 00:04:06,844
STORR: Ah well, you can leave me out of your fun and games. I've got enough troubles of my own.
好, 你自己去找你的乐子玩你的游戏吧, 我自己这里已经不少麻烦了

46
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:11,494
PENLEY: You're fit enough now. To do the cooking, at least. Thanks to science.
你恢复得还可以了, 至少可以做做饭。感谢科学

47
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:18,554
STORR: Science! Och, it wasn't science, it was just good plain doctoring.
科学, 哦, 可不是科学, 只是一点点简单的医术。

48
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:24,554
And if you smirk again like that, I'll crack your head open with this.
如果你还要像刚才那样傻笑, 我就那这个把你脑袋拧下来

49
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:29,236
PENLEY: Yes, you're definitely back to your normal witty self. What's the matter?
是, 但你至少又会开玩笑了是吧。什么情况？

50
00:04:30,225 --> 00:04:31,511
STORR: Someone's outside.
外面有人

51
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:40,344
PENLEY: They must have tracked me here from the base. Hide yourself. We don't want you carted off to Africa yet. You!
他们肯定从基地跟着我到这里来的, 你藏起来。我们可不想你被运到非洲去

52
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:50,564
GARRETT: I followed you. It's all right, I'm alone.
我跟踪了你, 不过没关系, 就我一个人

53
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:53,857
PENLEY: What do you want?
你想要干什么

54
00:04:54,116 --> 00:04:59,247
GARRETT: Elric, we're in desperate trouble at the base. You're the only one who can help us.
Elric, 我们基地陷入了大麻烦。你是唯一能帮助我们的

55
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:02,858
PENLEY: Clent doesn't need me. All he wants is a mirror. Preferably rose-tinted.
Clent 不需要我。他想要的只是一面镜子。最好还是玫瑰色的

56
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:06,180
GARRETT: He does need you, to make the ioniser work again.
他需要你, 让离子器能够恢复工作

57
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:08,340
PENLEY: Is that all?
就这个？

58
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:13,838
GARRETT: No. He's faced with having to report the full situation to World Control.
不止。他现在必须得向世界总控中心报告总体情况了

59
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:22,008
PENLEY: Oh well, now we're coming to it, aren't we? The great Clent would have to admit failure. That's it, isn't it?
哈, 那我们得去吧, 是不？伟大的Clent得承认他的失败了, 是吧

60
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:28,108
Poor old Clent. He never could face the music.
可怜的老Clent，他可能无法面对这个。

61
00:05:28,477 --> 00:05:32,908
Here, what about this creature at the glacier?
对了, 那个冰川怪兽怎么样了

62
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,997
GARRETT: That's only part of our trouble. The real problem is the ioniser. Will you come?
那还只是麻烦的一部分。真正的问题还是离子器。你会来吗？

63
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,051
PENLEY: It's typical of him to send you, instead of armed guards.
还真是他的典型作风，他派你来，而不是派带武器的警卫来

64
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:45,109
GARRETT: He doesn't know I'm here. I'm asking you.
他不知道我来这里, 是我在问你

65
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,779
PENLEY: I won't come.
我不会去

66
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:57,109
GARRETT: But you can't just step aside. A man like you, living like a scavenger? It's utterly wrong. Civilisation needs you.
但你不能遛边站啊。一个像你这样的人, 过得像个拾荒者一样。这是全然不对的, 文明世界需要你

67
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:06,910
PENLEY: Jane, I chose this existence. I chose it because I refuse to be sucked into that computerised ant-heap you call a civilisation.
Jane, 这种情况是我自己选择的。我这么选择就是因为我拒绝那个被电脑占据的世界, 你所谓的文明世界。

68
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,910
I'm a man, not a machine. I will not return.
我是一个人, 不是一台机器。我不会回去的

69
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:13,719
GARRETT: Not even to save the world?
拯救世界也不管了？

70
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:22,255
PENLEY: Save the world? Well, that has a fine Clentian ring to it. No thanks, no. It'll take more than me to do that.
拯救世界？呵, 那还真是Clent的做派啊。不,谢谢了。我担当不了这个重任

71
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:31,255
But don't you worry, you don't get rid of my sort all that easily. Machines corrode and rust, but mankind goes on.
但你不要担心, 你也没法完全甩掉我这类人。机器会锈蚀会坏掉, 但人类还将继续

72
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:36,255
You'll find Clent one of these days in a museum, like that ancient stove, with an inscription round him.
到了那一天你会在博物馆里面找到Clent的, 就像那些古代的炉子, 周边还刻着铭文

73
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:43,255
Robotised human mark two, now extinct. But you'll find others like me still alive.
"机器人类第二代, 已灭绝"。不过你会发现我这类人还活着

74
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:47,786
GARRETT: Surely, Elric, that's all the more reason to come back. To change things.
当然, Elric, 这更加是你要回来的原因, 去改变一些东西

75
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:54,073
PENLEY: Don't you understand, Jane? Clent's just a talker. He's a glib political animal.
你不明白吗, Jane? Clent 只会侃侃而谈, 他是能说善道的政治动物

76
00:06:54,286 --> 00:07:00,073
Even if I did change things, the Clent's of this world would still come out on top.
就算我改变了一些东西, 但这个世界的Clent还是会跑到顶上去

77
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:07,073
Running things according to their own whims and indulgences. And the pity of it is, they believe they're right.
凭着一时的喜好, 他们这样, 他们那样。但遗憾的是, 他们还认为他们是对的

78
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:12,632
GARRETT: Then you leave me no alternative. You will come, and now!
这样我就别无选择了, 你得来, 现在就走

79
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:20,350
PENLEY: You must be desperate. But tranquillising me isn't going to make it any easier. You'd never be able to carry me all that way.
你肯定都绝望了。但招安了我也不会让事情变得简单。你不可能一直这样抗着我

80
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,352
STORR: Oh no you don't!
哦, 你别这样

81
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:22,482
GARRETT: Who's this?
这是谁？

82
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,974
PENLEY: Just a friend. Now what are you going to do?
只是一个朋友。你打算干什么？

83
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:29,577
GARRETT: Return to base and wait for the inevitable disaster.
回到基地, 等着避不可避的灾难来临

84
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:34,917
STORR: Oh no, you don't. I'm not having you set the dogs on me. I'd as soon put an end to her game. Give me that.
哦, 不要这样。我可受不了这个(?), 我要终结她的这个游戏。把那个给我

85
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,387
PENLEY: Storr, no. She won't put us away.
Storr, 不要。她不会把我们带走的

86
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:38,507
GARRETT: No, I won't.
不, 我不会

87
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:40,167
STORR: I don't trust any of them.
他们中的任何一个我都不相信

88
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:45,756
GARRETT: Please trust me enough to come with me to safety. Apart from the danger of the glacier, these creatures.
请相信我, 跟我去是安全的地方。那些冰川才是危险的, 那些怪物

89
00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:55,902
PENLEY: Oh yes, your ice warriors. Well, we shall just have to take our chance. No, I won't return. And now you must go.
哦, 对, 你的寒冰勇士。我们只能试试自己的运气了。不, 我不会回去的。你现在得走了

90
00:07:56,117 --> 00:08:03,902
But if Sir Genius does have trouble with the ioniser, look up my notes on the Omega factor.
如果天才先生在离子器方面还是碰到困难的话, 翻一翻我的笔记里面关于Omega因子的那部分

91
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:06,614
GARRETT: Thank you for that at least.
谢谢你告诉我这个

92
00:08:10,652 --> 00:08:12,841
STORR: This ice warrior. It's real then.
这个寒冰勇士, 是真的了？

93
00:08:12,902 --> 00:08:15,682
PENLEY: Oh yes. And I'm going up there again.
是的。我打算再去那里

94
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:16,871
STORR: But why, man?
为什么？

95
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:23,218
PENLEY: Because I must know. Now, put this knife to more sensible use.
因为我必须搞明白。现在, 把这把刀用在正事上吧

96
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:32,374
VARGA: If you value life, obey, and do not anger us.
如果你惜命的话, 就照做, 不要激怒我们

97
00:08:32,654 --> 00:08:35,766
VICTORIA: I want to go back to my friends.
我想回到我的朋友们那里去

98
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:43,985
VARGA: Perhaps later. For the moment, you are useful to us. Zondal.
也许晚点可以。但现在, 你对我们有用。Zondal

99
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,364
ZONDAL: Commander.
指挥官

100
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:52,166
VARGA: You will locate our buried spaceship without delay.
你马上定位埋在下面的飞船, 立刻进行

101
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:55,285
ZONDAL: That will not be difficult.
那应该不难

102
00:08:56,506 --> 00:09:01,006
VARGA: You will excavate sufficient space to form a cave.
你倒腾一点空间出来, 形成一个洞窟

103
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:03,167
ZONDAL: A cave.

VICTORIA: A trap? Who for?
陷阱？做什么用的？

106
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:14,146
VARGA: Do not interfere. Your friends may attack us.
不要插话。你的朋友可能攻击我们

107
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:18,028
VICTORIA: But they don't want to attack you. They could help you.
但他们不想要攻击你们, 他们可以帮你们

108
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,247
VARGA: We do not need help.
我们不需要帮助

109
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:23,406
VICTORIA: You'd still be frozen and dead if it wasn't for us.
如果不是我们的话, 你还在冰冻着

110
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:25,878
VARGA: You are a child.

111
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,419

哦, 你为什么不听

112
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:33,826
VARGA: Commence.

Sonic stalls ready. Set to wide impact. Take aim. Continuous fire!
split声波设备就绪。设定为大面积。瞄准, 持续喷射！

117
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:48,861
DOCTOR: If I was to reverse the sequence to give a density ratio. Where did I? Yes, here we are.
如果我反转这个过程, 加大密度。我刚才到哪儿了？对了,到这里了

118
00:10:49,280 --> 00:11:01,861
If I reverse the sequence to give a density ratio. Excuse me. Excuse me! Yes.
如果我反转这个过程, 加大密度。让让，让让, 好了

119
