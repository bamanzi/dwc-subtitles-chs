1
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:13,498
Mr Silverstein?
Yes. Who are you?

2
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:16,227
Anne Travers. Is my father here?

3
00:00:16,387 --> 00:00:20,619
Yes, he's here.
Come and see him and take him away.

4
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,778
He's a fool. An old fool!

5
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:25,461
Father?

6
00:00:26,707 --> 00:00:28,698
Father...

7
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:31,618
Anne...

8
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:35,663
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

9
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,176
You were supposed to be meeting me.

10
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:42,779
- Was I?
- At the airport.

11
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:47,940
What's wrong? You send me a cable
saying you're in grave trouble.

12
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:51,622
- I fly half the way round the world...
- Trouble? Yes.

13
00:00:51,787 --> 00:00:55,905
A great deal of trouble. It's that thing.

14
00:00:56,587 --> 00:00:58,578
The Yeti?
Mm.

15
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:02,023
You're a stupid old fool, Julius Silverstein!

16
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:07,181
ME the fool? You would like me to be the fool
and give you back my Yeti, huh?

17
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:10,737
You must, man. Don't you understand?
It's dangerous.

18
00:01:10,907 --> 00:01:16,425
For 30 years this stands here in my museum,
and now he tells me it is dangerous!

19
00:01:16,587 --> 00:01:20,978
- I wish I'd never brought it back from Tibet.
- Father, what has happened?

20
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:25,584
The silly old goat won't listen to me.
I've told him, warned him.

21
00:01:25,747 --> 00:01:30,662
- Damn it, he knows it's a robot!
- But, Father, the Yeti isn't dangerous.

22
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:33,864
It can't work unless it has a control unit.

23
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,302
But I've done it, Anne!

24
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:38,856
I HAVE reactivated the control unit.

25
00:01:39,947 --> 00:01:42,541
But, Father, this is wonderful news.

26
00:01:42,707 --> 00:01:46,177
Is it? Yes, I suppose it would be,
except for one thing.

27
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:48,338
What?

28
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:50,304
The sphere - it's gone!

29
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:54,699
It's disappeared! You must let me
have the Yeti back, Julius.

30
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:58,744
Make him understand, Anne!

31
00:01:58,907 --> 00:02:00,898
I understand.

32
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:03,740
I buy the Yeti off you 30 years ago.

33
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:06,501
Now, it is valuable.

34
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:10,057
You try to scare me, take your Yeti back.

35
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:12,218
Why? Money!

36
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:16,585
- You want to rob me!
- I'll buy the thing back if that's what you want!

37
00:02:17,587 --> 00:02:20,659
No, no. It's priceless.

38
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:23,580
The only one in the world, and it is mine.

39
00:02:23,747 --> 00:02:25,544
- You fool!
- Thief!

40
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:28,016
- I'm not a thief.
- Swindler!

41
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:29,540
Stubborn old goat!

42
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:33,256
- Father!
- Take him away - out of my house!

43
00:02:33,427 --> 00:02:35,418
Perhaps you've made a mistake.

44
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:40,138
You've put the sphere away
somewhere in your laboratory and forgotten it.

45
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:43,777
- You've done it before.
- No. I've looked everywhere.

46
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:47,986
Let's go home and look again, shall we?
You know what you're like.

47
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:49,500
Yes, but suppose...

48
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:53,740
Let's go and have a quiet dinner,
and you can tell me all about it.

49
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,580
Then we'll go home and look for the sphere.

50
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:01,222
Well, all right...
But I warned you, Julius! I warned you!

51
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:03,059
Get out! Take him away!

52
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:07,106
Nobody destroys Julius Silverstein's collection!
Nobody!

53
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,542
- Come on, Father.
- The Yeti's mine!

54
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:12,267
You can't scare me with your mad stories.

55
00:03:13,347 --> 00:03:15,497
Out! Out!

56
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:49,341
Travers...

57
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:53,056
It is you? I am not frightened
by your stupid tricks!

58
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:55,218
Travers! I know it's you.

59
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:56,740
I'm not a fool!

60
00:04:24,427 --> 00:04:26,179
Agh!

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:48,000
(theme)

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
(the web of fear)

63
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,078
Some sort of grille.

64
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:14,681
Don't say you've landed us in a prison!

65
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,156
It could be the dungeons of a castle.

66
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:18,680
It's so dark.

67
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,838
Ah, steps.

68
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:23,316
Come along. Be careful.

69
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:32,805
Yes...

70
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,958
It seems to be a large room.

71
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,118
Tiled walls.

72
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:39,278
Curved ceiling.

73
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:41,358
Come on.

74
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:48,038
The floor seems to end here.

75
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:51,916
There's a sort of trench. Look.

76
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:56,524
- Hey, Doctor. Come and look at this.
- What have you found, Victoria?

77
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:58,678
See for yourself.

78
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:04,677
"Covent... Garden... "

79
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:10,285
Yes, of course! It's an underground station.
We're standing on the platform.

80
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:13,280
- Underground station?
- Underground trains.

81
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:17,486
- A little after your time, Victoria.
- Is it always as dark as this?

82
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:22,243
No, it's probably the middle of the night.
Come on. Let's go up top.

83
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:29,955
- Professor Travers is here, sir.
- Why have I been brought here? Who are you?

84
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:32,004
- Knight.
- Never heard of you.

85
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,158
Captain Knight. OK, Corporal.

86
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:37,084
It's no good shouting at me.

87
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,636
- I didn't ask for you.
- Who did, then?

88
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:43,322
- Your daughter.
- Anne? Just like her mother.

89
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,398
Always interfering in things!

90
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:48,525
I understood that you'd sent for her to help you.

91
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:50,325
What do you want me for?

92
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:56,960
- I don't. I think this is a military matter.
- Well, you haven't had much success so far!

93
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:04,961
Army What the devil do they know about it?

94
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:13,405
- The Doctor was wrong!
- It's not night-time. It's broad daylight.

95
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:20,397
- Just let me get my breath... Those stairs!
- It looks like we're locked in.

96
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,478
- That's strange.
- Doctor...

97
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:25,161
- Yes?
- Listen.

98
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:26,840
I can't hear anything.

99
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:34,920
Oh... It IS quiet. I see what you mean. The
middle of London. There should be some noise.

100
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,840
There's an old man over there. Let's ask him.

101
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:39,918
Yes, go on.

102
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,759
Excuse me...

103
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:46,918
Excuse me...

104
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:52,444
Who are you?

105
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:56,516
- Harold Chorley. London Television.
- What? Television?

106
00:07:56,687 --> 00:08:00,726
- Never watch it. Are you an actor?
- Journalist, actually.

107
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:07,284
The government decided to only allow one
correspondent down here. The press chose me.

108
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,324
Oh, yeah?

109
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:14,277
Will you be in charge of the scientific section,
or will your daughter?

110
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:16,438
Mind your own business!

111
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:21,400
How long do you think it will take you
to come up with the answer?

112
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,082
- One week? Three, perhaps?
- How the hell should I know?

113
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:27,078
- Is that working?
- Of course.

114
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:32,360
It's more than likely
we may not be able to defeat this menace.

115
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:37,203
The whole of England might be completely
wiped out. There - did you get that?

116
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:02,599
- What are you doing?
- Just confirming something.

117
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:06,885
Just as I thought.
There haven't been any trains here for some time.

118
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,038
What's that over there?

119
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:18,920
It's a power cable.
I wonder what it's doing down here.

120
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:21,078
In there quickly!

121
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:58,363
Soldiers? I wonder what they're doing down here.

122
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,998
- Let's go and ask them.
- No. I think we'd better tread carefully.

123
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,920
Let's go and find out what's going on first.

124
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,917
What do you want us to do, Doctor?

125
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:20,682
You follow the soldiers, but keep out of sight.

126
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:25,967
I'm going to see where this cable goes to.
Meet back here in a few minutes.

127
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:39,445
- What's the matter?
- I thought I heard something.

128
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:44,044
- Getting a bit jumpy, aren't you, Weams?
- It's no wonder, is it, Staff?

129
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:47,961
- Shall we connect the new drum now, Staff?
- All right, Corporal.

130
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:52,086
- Good thing we fixed these lights.
- Yeah.

131
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:01,882
- I can't hear anything.
- Are they still there?

132
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:04,880
I think they must be moving. Come on.

133
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:08,125
Agh!

134
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:14,083
- I told you I heard something, didn't I?
- Yeah.

135
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:16,158
Come on!

136
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:18,966
- I'm sorry!
- It was only a cobweb!

137
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:23,166
- Do you think they heard?
- Hope not. Come on.

138
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:37,121
Well, well, well, would you believe it?
The Babes in the Wood!

139
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:09,498
- You're quite sure there was nobody with you?
- How many more times?

140
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,464
That's all right, then.

141
00:13:12,787 --> 00:13:16,097
- Clear to fire, Staff?
- Yes, they were on their own.

142
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:18,258
Right.

143
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:20,418
What was all that about?

144
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,540
I suppose there's no harm in telling you.
You two are very lucky.

145
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:28,460
- We're going to blow up the tunnel.
- What?!

146
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:31,266
- That's what the cable's for.
- The Doctor!

147
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:40,625
It's all right. They were on their own.
OK, let's not waste any more time. Off you go.

148
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:44,418
Agh!

149
00:13:49,476 --> 00:13:53,298
A doctor! Well, if he was anywhere near those explosives when they went up...

150
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:58,384
Yes sir. Don't you think I should go and have a look, sir? The youngsters said he was following the cable.

151
00:13:58,623 --> 00:13:59,672
Yes, you'd better.

152
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:00,443
Sir!

153
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,994
Oh, and Staff, take someone with you.

154
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,143
Sir!

155
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:17,659
Father?

156
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:18,453
Hmm...?

157
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,223
The soldiers have found two youngsters in the tunnels. They seem to know a great deal about the Yeti.

158
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:22,938
Oh?

159
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:24,445
They know they're robots!

160
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:25,104
What!

161
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:27,484
And they know about the control spheres, too.

162
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:30,369
But they can't have - I mean, the public were never told!

163
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:31,336
I know.

164
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:44,979
Hello, hello, Holborn?... This is HQ to Holborn. Can you hear me?... Not a sausage.

165
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:46,305
There must be someone manning the phone.

166
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,638
OK, Lane, what gives?

167
00:14:49,043 --> 00:14:50,807
Well, it's just firing at the other end, sir.

168
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:51,673
Firing?

169
00:14:51,888 --> 00:14:52,808
Yes, sir. Listen.

170
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,286
Oh, good grief, no!

171
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,433
Hello, HQ to Holborn?

172
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:17,881
What happened, Lane?

173
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,514
Well, it was difficult to hear, sir. I think the truck was late getting there...

174
00:15:20,718 --> 00:15:21,428
Then what?

175
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:24,437
Well they must have got the ammo unloaded, sir, 'cos he says they were jumped when they were moving.

176
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:26,281
Take O'Brien and a couple of the others.

177
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:27,730
Sir! Come on, mate.

178
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:31,728
Here, you're not going out there?

179
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:36,384
Yes, Mr Chorley. Want to come? Report some action first hand?

180
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,244
Well, I don't think I'd better get in the way. I... er... think I'd better stay here, don't you?

181
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:42,504
Yes. Yes, I think you better had.

182
00:15:47,355 --> 00:15:48,577
Father?

183
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,893
But it... it can't be...

184
00:15:53,248 --> 00:16:00,101
Why that's... that's over... forty years ago!

185
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:01,500
What's going on here?

186
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:05,324
Oh Jamie, don't you recognise him? It's Professor Travers.

187
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:10,576
So it is! Professor Travers! Here, hasn't he got old!

188
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:11,310
Huh?

189
00:16:11,494 --> 00:16:14,435
Oh, but we're very pleased to see you, Professor, very pleased.

190
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:19,838
The time machine... it was all true then?

191
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:24,454
The TARDIS - I mean aye, of course it's true! Hey, do you know what's happened to the Doctor?

192
00:16:24,624 --> 00:16:25,274
Oh, is he safe?

193
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:26,146
Isn't he with you?

194
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:29,396
No, he's in the tunnels. Arnold's gone to look for him. Father, what is going on?

195
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:32,982
Oh dear, I do hope he's alright. Come on, Jamie, let's go and find out if he's got back yet.

196
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:36,128
Father!

197
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:40,687
Eh? Oh, Victoria, try and explain to Anne, will you?

198
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:42,115
Oh dear!

199
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:01,524
There hasn't been an explosion, Staff!

200
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,921
Oh, no - well at least, we hope not.

201
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:03,673
I can see that, lad... Here!

202
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:16,876
No sign of that Doctor bloke.

203
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:20,352
No... here, give me a hand with this.

204
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:31,859
It's our detonator, alright. It's fired, too... 'ere, hang on a minute. All the ammo, Staff. If it's fired, then why didn't...

205
00:17:32,074 --> 00:17:35,578
Yeah, why didn't this tunnel go up?... No damage at all...

206
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:37,866
Yet something blew up here!

207
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:42,267
It's obvious, ain't it? It's been got at.

208
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,451
Where's that Doctor? That's what I'd like to know.

209
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,344
Tibet? Tibet? You're joking.

210
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:54,019
That's where old Travers says they come from. He reckons they're Abominable Snowmen.

211
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:57,442
Well, he's off his chump, ain't he? How'd they get here in the first place?

212
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:58,825
Come through the post, don't they?

213
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,540
Nah, seriously. Outer space, that's where they come from. Well that's what I reckon, anyway.

214
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:06,712
Oh do leave off! You've been reading too many kids' comics, you have!

215
00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:08,982
Alright then, Corp, where do they come from?

216
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:13,608
It's a foreign power, ain't it? Bacteriological warfare, that's what that stuff is in the tunnels.

217
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:14,975
What, that fungus stuff?

218
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:19,248
Yeah. And them Yeti are some sort of new weapon. Well, a sort of robot army.

219
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:20,893
What, you mean it ain't real then?

220
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:32,769
Father?

221
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:33,904
Hmm?

222
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:36,633
Have you ever seen this TARDIS?

223
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:39,493
No, no, I can't say I have.

224
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:42,034
It all sounds a bit far-fetched to me.

225
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:45,074
You know, I think the Doctor's at the back of all this.

226
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,270
What do you mean?

227
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:50,815
Doesn't it strike you as odd that on the two occasions you've encountered the Yeti, you've also come across the Doctor?

228
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:51,981
Well?

229
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,278
Well, it's obvious - he controls them!

230
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:55,812
Oh, but surely...

231
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:59,188
What? Oh, tea. Thank you, my dear.

232
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:01,966
Oh, aren't you having any?

233
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,792
No, I think I'll go and lie down for a bit.

234
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:06,215
Good idea.

235
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,297
Do you think she heard?

236
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:22,828
No... in any case, what you say is nonsense, Anne.
I saw the Doctor defeat those robots and save Detsen Monastery.
He wouldn't do that if he was in league with them, now would he?

237
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:25,213
No, no I suppose not. 

238
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:29,079
Here, Corp, look at this!

239
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:37,049
What... oh crikey! That's what comes of talking about it!

240
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:39,187
It's that fungus stuff, it's moving again!

241
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:45,660
Don't worry!

242
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:53,470
Can't help it - I feel... responsible somehow.
 If only the Doctor would turn up. I'm sure he could help us.

243
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,663
'Scuse me, sir...

244
00:19:55,858 --> 00:19:56,613
Eh, what?

245
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:59,801
That fungus stuff, it's on the move again. Euston Square's gone.

246
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:01,631
Come on, let's have a look!

247
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,093
It's on the move again, Weams?

248
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:09,905
Yes, sir. Kings Cross has gone, and it's moving on to Farringdon.

249
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:11,946
It's never moved as fast as this before!

250
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:13,612
Hasn't moved at all the last three weeks, Miss.

251
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:15,043
What started it up again all of a sudden?

252
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:16,109
Can't say.

253
00:20:16,322 --> 00:20:20,647
Strange, isn't it, that all this should happen on the very day that your mysterious Doctor friend turns up?

254
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:22,038
He hasn't turned up.

255
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:25,745
Precisely. He could have sent those kids in here as spies.

256
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,820
Rubbish! Would Jamie go away and leave Victoria, if he didn't intend coming back again?

257
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,584
Excuse me, sir, but where is the young lady?

258
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:33,173
Oh, in the Common Room, I suppose.

259
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:35,509
No she's not, 'cos I went in there when I was looking for you!

260
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:38,699
What? Well... where is she then?

261
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:57,471
Jamie? Doctor?... Jamie? Doctor?

262
00:20:57,892 --> 00:20:58,630
Victoria!

263
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,465
Oh, Doctor, thank goodness I found you! Are you alright?

264
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:03,324
Look, sir, the fungus! It's moving again!

265
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:09,930
Hope the Captain and Staff Arnold ain't anywhere near that little lot.

266
00:21:10,506 --> 00:21:15,390
Lane? Lane! Fall back, you'll never hold them!

267
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,571
Will nothing stop them?

268
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:39,507
Come on, back!

269
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:19,931
We couldn't hold 'em, sir. They're coming, two of 'em! They got O'Brien and Cocksey, nothing stops them!

270
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:23,746
It's Staff Arnold!

271
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:24,817
Yeah, come on.

272
00:22:32,214 --> 00:22:32,686
Captain?

273
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:33,420
Yeti!

274
00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:34,247
They got two of us!

275
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:35,412
And the ammo detail - they're all gone.

276
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:36,730
What's the plan then?

277
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:40,584
I brought a load of explosives down from Holborn. I'm going to blow it - and them with it.

278
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:42,452
Taking a bit of a risk, aren't you, sir?

279
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:43,658
Yeah, I know.

280
00:22:43,874 --> 00:22:45,222
Hey, look what's happening!

281
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:50,036
What are they doing?

282
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,338
Looks like the cobwebs!

283
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:01,711
Cobwebs or not, I'm going to blow it sky high. Get back!

284
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:14,771
What's that noise?

285
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,233
The boxes are pulsating!

286
00:23:24,105 --> 00:23:25,194
Get back!

287
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:41,914
This waiting's getting on my nerves. Why the heck don't they do something?

288
00:23:42,177 --> 00:23:44,370
Steady, lad. We'll know soon enough.

289
00:23:44,587 --> 00:23:46,979
We can't just stand here. Can't we make a run for it?

290
00:23:47,195 --> 00:23:49,079
We wouldn't stand a chance, not with them switched on.

291
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:50,766
How do you know that?

292
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:55,965
It's alright, sir. The Professor's vouched for him. Understand he knows a great deal about these robots.

293
00:23:56,146 --> 00:23:57,487
See, you have to find out...

294
00:23:57,762 --> 00:23:58,727
What's that?

295
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:20,307
What made them do that, I wonder?

296
00:24:20,487 --> 00:24:23,946
Couldn't say, sir. But I don't think we should stay to find out.

297
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:26,629
Yes, you're right, Staff. Come on, let's get back.

298
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,132
Wait - can we not just see what they're up to?

299
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:34,705
No! If there's one thing that I've learned, it's never push your luck. Now come on.

300
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:07,965
Soldier!

301
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,272
Well, there's a sight for sore eyes!

302
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:15,142
Are you stark raving mad?

303
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:17,401
Aye, well I always sing when I'm scared, see.

304
00:25:17,612 --> 00:25:19,268
Stand to attention when you're talking to an officer!

305
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:20,742
Name and serial!

306
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:21,822
6-0...

307
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:22,882
Shush!

308
00:25:23,082 --> 00:25:24,387
6-0-1 Evans, sir!

309
00:25:24,554 --> 00:25:26,255
Evans? Anybody know him?

310
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:28,142
Oh, I'm not one of your lot, sir.

311
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:29,827
Then what are you doing down here?

312
00:25:30,102 --> 00:25:31,548
Trying to get out, Sarge!

313
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:35,295
Don't try to be funny with me, lad! How did you get down here in the first place?

314
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:50,644
Driver on the ammo truck to Holborn. Got jumped, we did - quite a dust up, there was.
Couldn't get past them hairy creatures, see? Been wandering for hours. Lost, I was.
I tried one way, but there seemed to be some sort of cobweb muck moving down the tunnel.

315
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:52,688
Moving? Are you sure it was moving?

316
00:25:52,848 --> 00:26:00,851
Well of course I'm sure!... sir. Sounds daft, I know,
but it seemed to be following a Yeti that had a kind of pointed glass thing in its hands.

317
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:02,068
Was it shaped like a pyramid?

318
00:26:02,257 --> 00:26:03,265
Well, I suppose it was, really.

319
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:05,878
Well that's it! Smash the pyramid, and you put the Intelligence out of action!

320
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:06,879
What Intelligence?

321
00:26:07,064 --> 00:26:08,261
Whereabouts did you say this happened?

322
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:09,499
Kings Cross, Staff.

323
00:26:09,664 --> 00:26:10,255
What!

324
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:11,628
Headquarters, sir - HQ may be in danger!

325
00:26:11,801 --> 00:26:13,270
Yes, we'd better get back as soon as we can. Come on.

326
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:13,912
No, look...

327
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,542
Now listen to what the officer said, young man. Come on!

328
00:26:15,753 --> 00:26:18,270
Look, I came down here to find the Doctor. I'm not going back till I have!

329
00:26:18,455 --> 00:26:19,112
Now look here...

330
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:21,342
No, I'm not going! And if I get a chance to smash that pyramid, I will!

331
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:22,622
That's quite a risk you're taking.

332
00:26:22,788 --> 00:26:24,062
Aye, but it's me that's taking it.

333
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,842
Alright, it's your neck, chum.

334
00:26:26,021 --> 00:26:26,585
Sir!

335
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:27,371
Yes?

336
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,522
I'd like to volunteer to go with the young gentleman, sir.

337
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:33,098
Well, you're not one of my lot... alright. Come on, the rest of you.

338
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:46,473
Monument! Then it's Tower Hill next.

339
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:52,389
Wait a minute! Did you hear something?

340
00:26:52,883 --> 00:26:53,622
What?

341
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:54,812
Listen.

342
00:26:58,978 --> 00:27:01,917
Look! The fungus, it's here!

343
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:06,427
We'd better get out, fast!

344
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,500
- Jamie!  - Doctor! Good to see you!

1
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:26,312
All right, Corporal. Nip back and tell Captain Knight it's all clear up 'ere. And get 'em to get a shift on!

2
00:27:26,523 --> 00:27:27,646
Righto, Staff.

3
00:27:30,436 --> 00:27:32,249
This looks familiar - it's around this corner.

4
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:33,922
Oh no!

5
00:27:34,443 --> 00:27:35,811
Oh, we can't get to the TARDIS!

6
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:39,465
No, Victoria, I'm afraid we can't.

7
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:41,499
What's happened to Chorley, then?

8
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:47,495
That's what I'm wondering. Did he reach the TARDIS before the fungus, or... or did he not?

9
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:50,452
You mean to say, he could have got to the TARDIS and already have taken off in it?

10
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:51,896
I don't know...

11
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:53,060
Hey, come back, Doctor!

12
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:58,326
It's alright, Jamie, I'm not going to do anything silly. I...
I just want to try and get a little bit for an analysis.

13
00:27:58,618 --> 00:27:59,616
Oh Jamie, stop him!

14
00:27:59,843 --> 00:28:01,027
It's alright, Victoria.

15
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,083
Has anyone got a box?

16
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:06,976
I've got my tobacco tin.

17
00:28:07,315 --> 00:28:08,515
Oh, splendid.

18
00:28:08,742 --> 00:28:09,974
But then, it's got tobacco in it.

19
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:10,888
Never mind.

20
00:28:11,112 --> 00:28:16,858
Eh!... Oh, alright. I only hope you think the sacrifice is worth it!

21
00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:19,996
Hold the tin for me, would you, Evans?

22
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,427
Gone and set it off! Come on, now!

23
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:28,487
Oh, it's horrible!

24
00:28:28,678 --> 00:28:29,888
Go on, Doctor, get it out!

25
00:28:30,103 --> 00:28:31,065
Hold the tin underneath!

26
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:34,596
There we are - now back, everyone, quickly!

27
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:43,686
Hello, Staff. It's alright, it's just Staff Arnold!

28
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:48,776
One of these days, Evans my lad, you're going to creep up onto someone once too often!

29
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:50,830
Well, that's life, innit Staff?

30
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:52,074
Any luck at Holborn?

31
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:53,197
No - fungus.

32
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,365
Same back there.

33
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,590
Right. I'll tell the Colonel. You lot had better get back to HQ. We'll be along in a few minutes.

34
00:28:58,855 --> 00:29:01,176
Come on, Jamie, I'll just show this bit of fungus to Travers.

35
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:01,992
Right.

36
00:29:06,729 --> 00:29:08,683
Hey, look at this!

37
00:29:09,094 --> 00:29:11,574
Good Lord! That's Yeti!

38
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:13,791
You don't think they may still be here?

39
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:14,717
I hope not!

40
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:16,028
Oh, Doctor!

41
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,632
D'you reckon they have?

42
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:25,783
Have what?

43
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:27,535
Taken him? Like she said?

44
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:35,563
Yes, I'm very much afraid they have. But why? Why didn't they just kill him? Unless...

45
00:29:35,812 --> 00:29:36,695
Yes?

46
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:38,498
Well, unless they had a use for him.

47
00:29:40,658 --> 00:29:42,758
Ah, Doctor. What's this I hear about Travers?

48
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:52,090
'Scuse me, sir, but I think you ought to come to the Ops Room.

49
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:53,219
Why? What's happening?

50
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,231
That fungus stuff, it's on the move again!

51
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:08,744
It's like a spider's web, ain't it?

52
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:13,254
Yes. And we're the flies, alright, but... where is the spider?

53
00:30:13,876 --> 00:30:15,614
Better give the others a hand, Corporal.

54
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:16,429
Sir.

55
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:25,690
Doctor. Been thinking about what you were saying earlier,
about someone here in HQ being responsible for all this.
Could it have been Travers?

56
00:30:26,184 --> 00:30:27,024
I doubt it.

57
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:29,516
Well, after all he has disappeared.

58
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:34,815
Yes - so has Chorley. I'd say he was a much more likely suspect.

59
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:35,877
True.

60
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:41,471
On the other hand, of course, whoever is in league with the Intelligence could still be amongst us here.

61
00:30:42,782 --> 00:30:49,822
That's a fact of which I am uncomfortably aware.
But tell me, Doctor, this Intelligence - exactly what is it?

62
00:30:50,404 --> 00:31:04,617
Well I wish I could give you a precise answer.
Perhaps the best way to describe it is a sort of formless, shapeless thing
floating about in space like a cloud of mist, only... with a mind and will.

63
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:06,810
What's it after? What's it want?

64
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:10,952
I wish I knew. The only thing I know for sure is that it brought me here.

65
00:31:11,854 --> 00:31:13,074
Brought you here?

66
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:15,238
Yes, been wondering how you got here.

67
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:23,971
Yes, well I... I don't think there's any harm in telling you now. 
I...I have a craft, that travels in time and space.

68
00:31:25,023 --> 00:31:27,253
Oh, come now Doctor, you can't expect me to...

69
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:32,134
This craft of yours, this time-space craft. Could it get us out of here?

70
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,418
Well, yes - but it's at Covent Garden!

71
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:37,006
What does it look like?

72
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:39,345
It's a police box.

73
00:31:39,612 --> 00:31:41,464
Oh really, Colonel, surely you're not...

74
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:45,012
So - if we could rescue that craft, you could take us out?

75
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,018
Yes, yes I could, but I have to stay here and finish Travers' work!

76
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:54,409
Ah, Doctor. Miss Travers is feeling alright now, and would like to see you right away.

77
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:57,184
Very good, Jamie. Excuse me, gentlemen, please.

78
00:31:57,453 --> 00:31:57,967
Yes.

79
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:02,095
Well, I've heard some stories in my time, but that one really takes...

80
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:03,193
So you don't believe him?

81
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:07,269
No, of course not, sir! The whole idea is screwy. A police box!

82
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:11,024
Well whether you think it foolish or not, we are going to rescue that craft.

83
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,837
Oh, but sir! Our job...

84
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:25,633
Captain Knight. The Army has failed to defeat this menace.
Now the Doctor thinks he might succeed. Personally, I doubt it.
But if we stay here, we're as good as dead.
Therefore I do not intend leaving any escape route unexplored, however... screwy you may think it.

85
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:26,774
Oh, surely Colonel...

86
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:28,411
Let's get on with it, shall we, Knight?

87
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:29,432
Sir.

88
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:36,914
But... but there must be a chance! If the Doctor says...

89
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:51,054
No, the soldiers could comb these tunnels for a fortnight and still never find him.
I'm afraid your father's been taken by the Intelligence.
The only way that we can save him is by finding the central control source.

90
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:53,046
Aye, if he's anywhere, that's where he'll be.

91
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:57,180
But why? Why him? Why not me, or one of the soldiers, or...

92
00:32:57,357 --> 00:33:07,121
Yes, I know. Tell me, what was your father working
on just before the Yeti broke in, Anne?

93
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:11,360
Um... oh, we were ready to test the sphere with the control unit

94
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,960
but I don't see what this has to do with anything, Doctor.

95
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:17,721
But don't you? If he was near to success...

96
00:33:17,966 --> 00:33:19,206
That's why they took him!

97
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,765
Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?
Now Anne, do you feel strong enough to come back to the laboratory?

98
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:24,979
Yes, yes of course.

99
00:33:25,152 --> 00:33:25,932
Anything we can do?

100
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:27,083
No, no, you just take it easy, Jamie.

101
00:33:30,014 --> 00:33:31,237
What's the matter?

102
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:36,761
I've been thinking about what the Doctor said.
Anything we do, the Intelligence always knows!

103
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:40,579
Aye, but I wouldn't let it worry you. The Doctor will soon find a way out.

104
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:42,521
I wish I could believe that.

105
00:33:44,411 --> 00:33:49,126
Oh yes. Yes, this seems to be in order, Anne.

106
00:33:49,855 --> 00:33:55,489
My father didn't want it put together until this was in proper order.

107
00:33:55,735 --> 00:33:57,344
Very wise. Let's have a look at this...

108
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:03,425
Oh yes, yes... My word, this is a splendid piece of work, Anne.

109
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,134
Thank you.

110
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:09,097
Yes, this should control the sphere, alright, but would it override the commands issued by the Intelligence, I wonder?

111
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:13,040
No. No, I'm afraid it won't. I just didn't have the time. Do you think we can do it?

112
00:34:13,228 --> 00:34:15,229
Oh, we can do it, if you've got the right bits and pieces.

113
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:19,197
Hope I'm not disturbing, Doctor, but Staff asked me to give you this.

114
00:34:20,832 --> 00:34:21,950
Where'd you get this?

115
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,411
On the floor, by that young lad Weams, it was.

116
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:31,378
But this is what brought the Yeti to the explosives store!
It's obviously been reprogrammed as a homing device, and you've given it to me!

117
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:35,149
Here! You don't think I had anything to do with these Yeti, do you?

118
00:34:35,356 --> 00:34:38,875
Doctor! The other models - they've gone!

119
00:34:40,572 --> 00:34:50,504
Well don't look at me! I didn't want to come down here in the first place!
I shouldn't be down here at all, really. Driver, I am, see.
You'd better have this, before you say I've nicked it.

120
00:34:50,894 --> 00:34:51,733
Thank you.

121
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:53,953
And I'll have the tin back, when you've finished with it.

122
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:57,634
Don't look so unhappy - we're all under suspicion, you know, including me.

123
00:34:57,975 --> 00:34:58,648
Hmm!

124
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,073
What's in the tin, Doctor?

125
00:35:01,477 --> 00:35:09,707
It's the fungus from the tunnel. I thought if we examined it, it might give us a clue.
I must get this dismantled. It's like holding a time bomb.

126
00:35:11,434 --> 00:35:16,662
So my party will get above ground and approach Covent Garden by Neal Street. Is that clear?

127
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:23,086
Now Staff here will be taking the trolley through the tunnel, and will arrive, we hope, at the same time as we do. You picked your two men, Staff?

128
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,959
Yes, sir. Lane and Evans.

129
00:35:25,472 --> 00:35:28,799
Right. Now as soon as we get there, we shall be looking for a police box.

130
00:35:29,304 --> 00:35:30,132
A police box, sir?

131
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:34,636
Yes, a police box. Now I want that box either out of the station or onto the trolley as quickly as possible. Is that understood?

132
00:35:34,814 --> 00:35:35,370
Yes, sir.

133
00:35:35,544 --> 00:35:36,272
Right. Any questions?

134
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:38,775
Yes, sir, this, um... police box. Is it important?

135
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:42,110
Corporal Blake, we'd hardly be going to this trouble if it weren't.

136
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:44,717
Who's going to look after the civilians, sir?

137
00:35:45,078 --> 00:35:51,213
I'd like you to stay behind and look after them, Captain Knight.
The Doctor's got work to do. Right gentlemen, time to go.

138
00:35:51,557 --> 00:35:52,335
Ah, Doctor.

139
00:35:52,524 --> 00:35:53,307
Oh Jamie, what is it?

140
00:35:53,477 --> 00:35:54,795
The Colonel says to tell you he's on his way.

141
00:35:54,975 --> 00:35:55,972
On his way where?

142
00:35:56,136 --> 00:35:57,429
To rescue the TARDIS!

143
00:35:57,597 --> 00:35:58,409
He's wasting his time.

144
00:35:58,543 --> 00:36:01,151
Well that's what I told him. And I think that man Chorley must be behind...

145
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:04,471
Now look! Get behind me, both of you, and keep clear. Here we go...

146
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:08,884
No!

147
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,981
What is it, Doctor?

148
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:14,988
The tin's empty!... Evans!

149
00:36:16,623 --> 00:36:23,312
Course, really I shouldn't be doing this, you know, Staff.
Not officially on the strength down here, see.
What I am really is a driver, you see...

150
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:26,684
Don't try to come the old soldier with me, lad!

151
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:28,110
Who, me?

152
00:36:28,427 --> 00:36:35,472
Yes, you! And when we get in the tunnels, don't you try to skive off,
 'cos if you do I'll have you for breakfast. D'you understand?

153
00:36:36,454 --> 00:36:37,352
Trolley's ready, Staff.

154
00:36:37,581 --> 00:36:38,363
Right, come on!

155
00:36:49,175 --> 00:36:53,881
So far, so good. If we don't see any Yeti, we should make Covent Garden in about ten minutes. Come on!

156
00:37:02,317 --> 00:37:04,852
Captain, they've gone, and Evans with them, I think. I can't find him anywhere.

157
00:37:05,078 --> 00:37:07,652
Yes, well we'd better question Evans carefully when he gets back.

158
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:08,918
Aye, if he gets back.

159
00:37:09,122 --> 00:37:12,147
It's a funny business, Doctor, that fungus disappearing.

160
00:37:12,453 --> 00:37:19,925
Yes, yes I know... Don't worry about that just at the moment.
I've been working on this control box with Miss Travers.
There's a few more things I need - transistors, circuits...

161
00:37:19,932 --> 00:37:20,844
Aren't there any in Stores?

162
00:37:21,043 --> 00:37:22,200
No, not of the right type.

163
00:37:22,401 --> 00:37:24,007
Well in that case, Doctor, I can't help you.

164
00:37:24,194 --> 00:37:27,595
Well - I was wondering... if I could go up to street level...

165
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:29,324
The mist! Or the Yeti!

166
00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:31,692
There's no mist directly above us here - we'd have to risk the Yeti.

167
00:37:31,902 --> 00:37:33,491
No. No, I'm afraid that's out.

168
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:35,565
It's terribly important. Please!

169
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:37,719
It'll only take five minutes.

170
00:37:38,418 --> 00:37:40,426
Alright. I'll get my gear.

171
00:37:40,735 --> 00:37:42,106
Well done, Travers!

172
00:37:43,707 --> 00:37:47,496
The Colonel will be through there at Covent Garden in a few minutes, right?

173
00:37:47,926 --> 00:37:50,371
Do you think they'll be able to load the police box on here, Staff?

174
00:37:50,683 --> 00:38:00,479
Well, if we can get this thing through the fungus stuff -
there's not much of a gradient in this section of the tunnel.
Right, I want one volunteer.

175
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:04,392
Volunteer? That's a dirty word, that is. Not me!

176
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:05,410
Lane?

177
00:38:05,604 --> 00:38:06,513
What for, Staff?

178
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,263
Well, if this thing wants some help going through to Covent Garden, I'm going through with it...

179
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:11,321
Into that stuff?

180
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:12,716
Have we got those respirators?

181
00:38:13,303 --> 00:38:14,277
Well yeah, here.

182
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,632
I reckon we should be all right in these.

183
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:26,962
Oh all right, Lane lad. I'll go by meself.

184
00:38:27,835 --> 00:38:32,654
No, 'ang on a sec, Staff. That trolley's heavy, it'll take two of us to shift it.

185
00:38:33,587 --> 00:38:35,926
Good lad. Come on.

186
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:37,597
You're potty, the pair of you!

187
00:38:37,827 --> 00:38:42,663
Shut up, will you! Do as you're told.
Play that rope out as we go; any sign of trouble whip us out sharpish. Right?

188
00:38:42,898 --> 00:38:43,711
Well, it's your neck.

189
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:44,418
OK.

190
00:38:44,643 --> 00:38:45,388
Alright then...

191
00:39:11,738 --> 00:39:15,774
Staff? Staff Arnold?...

192
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:44,669
Look, sir!

193
00:39:48,474 --> 00:39:49,414
In Here! Quick!

194
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:54,562
Come on, through the gate!

195
00:39:57,002 --> 00:39:59,077
I'm going to find a way out. Split up!

196
00:40:20,116 --> 00:40:21,722
Yetis - three of them, sir!

197
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:22,763
Grenades!

198
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:31,260
Right, fire!

199
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,033
Sir, they're smashing down the gate!

200
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,354
We can't hold 'em, sir!

201
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:00,455
Over the top, all of you!

202
00:41:27,025 --> 00:41:28,278
Grenades!

203
00:41:45,887 --> 00:41:47,614
Through the yard, come on!

204
00:41:54,052 --> 00:41:55,029
Right, bazooka here to cover the others.

205
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:13,361
Dawson! Langley!

206
00:42:31,288 --> 00:42:37,756
Make for the warehouse!... Murphy!

207
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,479
There it is again, Doctor!

208
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,704
Just one more thing.

209
00:43:03,852 --> 00:43:05,509
For heaven's sake, hurry up!

210
00:43:05,724 --> 00:43:08,337
I just need one more component. I'll look through here.

211
00:43:23,328 --> 00:43:25,228
Doctor! Doctor, look out!

212
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:29,454
No! No!

213
00:44:00,975 --> 00:44:02,523
And this was in his pocket, you say?

214
00:44:03,815 --> 00:44:06,146
How did he get it? You said it was stolen.

215
00:44:06,676 --> 00:44:08,260
You can't think that he...

216
00:44:08,495 --> 00:44:12,729
No no no, he didn't steal it. The person who did planted it on him.

217
00:44:13,106 --> 00:44:13,734
Hmm!

218
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:19,269
Eh, don't you try and pin this on me, boyo! Strikes me, anything goes wrong around here and I'm always the one to get the blame.

219
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:24,999
Alright, alright, let's keep our temper, shall we? The point is, two of these were missing. Now where's the other one?

220
00:45:27,044 --> 00:45:35,372
There. That one shouldn't bother us any more.
Now then, come along, Anne, let's get down to work. 
Where did I put those bits and pieces?

221
00:45:35,393 --> 00:45:37,973
I wish I knew who put it in the Captain's pocket.

222
00:45:38,156 --> 00:45:39,824
Well it must have been Chorley.

223
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:40,903
Well look, he left ages ago.

224
00:45:41,082 --> 00:45:42,313
It doesn't matter. He could still...

225
00:45:42,598 --> 00:45:43,380
Colonel!

226
00:45:43,598 --> 00:45:44,409
Are you alright?

227
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:45,755
What's happened?

228
00:45:46,401 --> 00:45:47,656
Colonel, what happened?

229
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:49,826
Gone.

230
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:51,510
Not all of them?

231
00:45:52,405 --> 00:45:54,308
All of them?

232
00:45:54,529 --> 00:45:59,681
I said so, didn't I? All of them. Evans, what about your party?

233
00:46:01,227 --> 00:46:02,032
Arnold?

234
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:03,170
Gone, sir.

235
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:05,544
Captain Knight, too.

236
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,970
Knight! Hopeless.

237
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:22,059
Can't fight them - it seems... indestructible. Can't fight them!
 You were right, Doctor, when you said they were... formless, shapeless... you were right.

238
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:29,076
Listen... listen, everyone! It's the other Yeti model! It's here! It's somewhere in this room!

239
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,955
That noise, I've been hearing it on and off all day...

240
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:31,856
Your pockets!

241
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:32,610
What?

242
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,913
Open your pockets, Colonel! Quickly, quickly, come on!

243
00:46:36,684 --> 00:46:38,128
How... how...

244
00:46:38,303 --> 00:46:39,622
They bring the Yeti!

345
00:46:47,774 --> 00:46:48,802
Oh no!

346
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:50,371
I just don't understand what's happening!

347
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:51,354
Poor Travers!

348
00:46:51,593 --> 00:46:52,874
Silence!

349
00:46:53,092 --> 00:46:53,798
Father!

350
00:46:53,993 --> 00:46:54,935
No, no! No!

351
00:46:55,216 --> 00:46:56,012
But I must...

352
00:46:56,217 --> 00:46:58,033
No, Anne! Don't go near him. Just... just listen to him.

353
00:46:58,207 --> 00:47:03,923
I... am... the Intelligence!

354
00:47:04,926 --> 00:47:19,974
Listen to me! I speak to you with this man's voice
because the time has come for you to understand my purpose.

355
00:47:20,444 --> 00:47:21,472
What's he getting at?

356
00:47:21,651 --> 00:47:22,360
Quiet!

357
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:23,615
What do you want?

358
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:27,265
You defeated me in Tibet, Doctor.

359
00:47:27,522 --> 00:47:28,079
Yes.

360
00:47:28,321 --> 00:47:36,485
Now you have fallen into the trap that I have so carefully prepared for you.

361
00:47:36,796 --> 00:47:37,698
What do you want?

362
00:47:38,372 --> 00:47:55,449
You! Your mind will be invaluable to me. Therefore I have invented a machine
 that will drain all past knowledge and experience from your mind.

363
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:57,016
But you'll kill him!

364
00:47:57,459 --> 00:48:05,560
Oh, no. He will survive, his mind unharmed - only empty

365
00:48:05,781 --> 00:48:06,848
You can't - we'll fight!

366
00:48:07,124 --> 00:48:13,449
That will not do. The Doctor must submit willingly.

367
00:48:13,848 --> 00:48:16,955
And if I... if I do submit, what of the others?

368
00:48:18,054 --> 00:48:20,859
Then the others will go free.

369
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,950
And my father too?

370
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:31,756
Oh, him too. I'm only using his body to communicate with you.

371
00:48:32,807 --> 00:48:34,491
He didn't help you before, then?

372
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:44,653
Oh, no. I have many other human hands at my command.

373
00:48:44,966 --> 00:48:45,855
And who are they?

374
00:48:47,755 --> 00:49:02,168
Always questioning! Even now, you're seeking to destroy me! I see I shall have to guide your thoughts.

375
00:49:03,917 --> 00:49:04,910
No, Jamie, no!

376
00:49:09,754 --> 00:49:21,152
Cooperate and the child will be unharmed. You have twenty minutes to make up your mind.

377
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,158
Let me go, Doctor!

378
00:49:23,382 --> 00:49:25,217
Jamie, don't be a fool! You don't stand a chance.

379
00:49:25,438 --> 00:49:26,524
Let me go! Victoria!

380
00:49:28,074 --> 00:49:29,063
Let me past, Colonel!

381
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:32,273
No. The Doctor's right. There've been enough lives wasted.

382
00:49:36,543 --> 00:49:41,997
Please... my wrist... Professor!

383
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:52,090
Eh! Wait a minute!

384
00:49:52,273 --> 00:49:54,091
What is it, Evans, what's the matter now?

385
00:49:54,277 --> 00:49:55,194
Stand back everyone!

386
00:49:59,507 --> 00:50:01,060
I thought I heard it go!

387
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:07,904
Yes, well we'd better make sure. Evans - you, myself and McCrimmon will go and search the place. Doctor, you'd better stay behind here and get on with your tinkering.

388
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Professor, please, you're hurting me! My wrist! Professor!

389
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:35,872
Yes... yes, that should complete the circuit, good... I wonder...

390
00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:39,016
There's only one way to find out.

391
00:50:39,224 --> 00:50:42,253
Yes. Certainly no sound out there.

392
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:43,978
Shall we chance it, then?

393
00:50:44,181 --> 00:50:45,394
Why not?

394
00:50:47,817 --> 00:50:48,704
Now!

395
00:50:49,235 --> 00:50:50,875
No! Back! No!

396
00:50:51,138 --> 00:50:58,327
Push! Push! Push, hard as you can! Push, get your back to it! Get your back to it!

397
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:01,758
Fire door - by the stairs - go and unhitch it, and I'll try to hold this. Go on, McCrimmon!

398
00:51:01,945 --> 00:51:02,349
You sure?

399
00:51:02,557 --> 00:51:04,174
Yes, go on! Go on!

400
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:12,280
Alright, Colonel, come on!

401
00:51:16,696 --> 00:51:24,770
Strange, it's not picking up. The Intelligence must be transmitting... I wonder why it's not working...

402
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,476
Aha! Success! It's going, Anne! Come along.

403
00:51:31,665 --> 00:51:35,522
Oh, oh that's marvellous. I'm sorry I'm being so long - this is such a fiddling job.

404
00:51:35,685 --> 00:51:36,848
Help you in a minute...

405
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,284
There we are. Now then...

406
00:51:40,232 --> 00:51:42,130
Yes, you see, it's homing!

407
00:51:43,585 --> 00:51:44,277
There we are... 

408
00:51:46,409 --> 00:51:47,922
Do we go on or turn back?

409
00:51:48,143 --> 00:51:49,195
Let's go on.

410
00:51:49,547 --> 00:51:50,520
Right.

411
00:51:54,867 --> 00:51:56,265
Come on, what are you waiting for?

412
00:51:57,299 --> 00:51:58,760
Hey, wait a minute!

413
00:51:59,652 --> 00:52:02,365
This is Victoria's! We're on the right track!

414
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,896
No, don't shoot!

415
00:52:20,023 --> 00:52:21,461
Is that thing on our side, then?

416
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:23,190
It is now. Stop!

417
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:27,822
Were you scared?

418
00:52:28,316 --> 00:52:35,297
Eh? Oh no, no, I mean, I just got up here to get a better aim, that's all. How did you make it stop then?

419
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:37,408
Simple - I told it to.

420
00:52:45,313 --> 00:52:50,165
Here - ball. Why don't you go back where you come from?

421
00:52:53,928 --> 00:52:55,201
Now, pull the other one.

422
00:52:55,402 --> 00:52:56,728
Oh, show him, Doctor.

423
00:52:57,158 --> 00:53:00,719
Alright, I will. Move forward.

424
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:08,521
Stop... Move to the left... Stop.

425
00:53:09,393 --> 00:53:10,747
There you are, how about that?

426
00:53:11,228 --> 00:53:14,713
Hey, that's great! Make a smashing toy, that would.

427
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:17,263
Toy? That's a highly complex piece of equipment.

428
00:53:17,429 --> 00:53:20,079
Oh, is it? Well I don't see how it's going to help us.

429
00:53:20,244 --> 00:53:21,955
But it obeys our commands!

430
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:22,800
So?

431
00:53:22,948 --> 00:53:27,102
Well, once we get it inside a Yeti, we'll have a powerful ally!

432
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:28,286
Inside a Yeti?

433
00:53:28,464 --> 00:53:29,971
Yes, certainly. Will you help us?

434
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:36,161
You must be joking, Go near one of them things? I may be stupid, but I'm not daft...

435
00:53:36,439 --> 00:53:38,581
Oh very well, Anne, I shall have to do it myself.

436
00:53:38,736 --> 00:53:39,711
Oh, I'm coming with you, Doctor.

437
00:53:39,874 --> 00:53:40,661
No no, it's far too dangerous.

438
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:41,810
There you are, what'd I tell you?

439
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,402
Not another word, I'm coming with you.

440
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:47,000
Hold it.

441
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:55,112
Staff Arnold? It can't be, we'd given you up for lost!

442
00:53:56,446 --> 00:53:57,702
Easy, easy...

443
00:53:58,017 --> 00:53:58,887
That's it.

444
00:53:59,084 --> 00:54:00,295
Sorry about this, sir.

445
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:01,304
What happened?

446
00:54:01,486 --> 00:54:20,419
I don't know. Can't remember. I were pushing the trolley through the fungus, and...
and I blacked out. I thought I were... falling. When I come to, sir, I were in the tunnels...
Where's the Doctor, sir? I met the Professor and the girl back there...

447
00:54:20,664 --> 00:54:21,661
Victoria! Is she alright?

448
00:54:21,849 --> 00:54:26,801
Yeti - guarding them, but... I promised I'd tell the Doctor, sir.

449
00:54:26,998 --> 00:54:28,010
Right. Come on, back to HQ.

450
00:54:28,187 --> 00:54:29,130
I'm going for Victoria.

451
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:33,690
Really, we'd stand a better chance if we stick together. Go ahead! Come on, Staff.

452
00:54:33,852 --> 00:54:35,288
Doctor's twenty minutes' almost up.

453
00:54:46,856 --> 00:54:49,350
Evans, come out from behind that board.

454
00:54:52,718 --> 00:54:53,878
Oh, it's you, sir.

455
00:54:54,112 --> 00:54:55,104
Where's the Doctor?

456
00:54:56,706 --> 00:54:57,605
Evans!

457
00:54:57,895 --> 00:54:59,038
B-b-but y-y-y-you...

458
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:02,657
Stop bleating like a Welsh baa-lamb, Evans, and answer the Colonel.

459
00:55:02,896 --> 00:55:03,393
Sir?

460
00:55:03,543 --> 00:55:05,028
Doctor and Miss Travers, where are they?

461
00:55:05,213 --> 00:55:05,924
Gone, sir.

462
00:55:06,142 --> 00:55:07,087
Gone - where?

463
00:55:07,286 --> 00:55:08,261
Warren Street, I think.

464
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,159
Why?

465
00:55:09,418 --> 00:55:10,541
After a Yeti, they said.

466
00:55:10,748 --> 00:55:11,777
Have a look at the board, sir.

467
00:55:11,983 --> 00:55:13,218
Warren Street.

468
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:14,698
Come on!

469
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:18,672
No, not you, Staff. Evans, make yourself useful. Get a dressing for the Staff Sergeant's head.

470
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,429
Yes, sir.

471
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:21,021
Thank you, sir.

472
00:55:23,307 --> 00:55:24,803
We're trapped!

473
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,307
Give me the control box, Anne.

474
00:55:28,602 --> 00:55:29,526
The control box...

475
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:30,292
Yes.

476
00:55:30,486 --> 00:55:31,122
Haven't you got it, Doctor?

477
00:55:32,361 --> 00:55:33,839
What! What... hold the sphere!

478
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,398
Oh Doctor, you must have it!

479
00:55:35,954 --> 00:55:36,694
Yes...

480
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:39,874
Doctor!

481
00:55:40,325 --> 00:55:42,290
Don't worry, it'll work!... It's got to work!

482
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:50,259
I know you said it only worked at short range, but for a moment...

483
00:55:50,655 --> 00:55:58,394
Well, don't tell me you were worried? Would you like to hold this for me?

484
00:56:07,885 --> 00:56:09,634
It's alright, it's quite safe.

485
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:13,436
Nearly out... there.

486
00:56:14,932 --> 00:56:16,038
Right.

487
00:56:20,575 --> 00:56:23,620
Now then - turn round!

488
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:27,989
Oh, it works! You've done it!

489
00:56:28,205 --> 00:56:36,610
We've done it, you mean! Now then, with my reprogrammed sphere and your control box,
we should be able to work him over quite a distance. And put your arm down!

490
00:56:37,923 --> 00:56:39,994
Now we've got a chance, Anne. Come on!

491
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:43,477
Oh, mustn't forget him. Come on, Fred, at the double!

492
00:56:46,972 --> 00:56:48,599
Staff! Staff!

493
00:56:48,994 --> 00:56:49,892
What is it?

494
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:53,569
What is it, Evans?

495
00:56:58,196 --> 00:57:02,530
Go on, Evans lad, get out of it!

496
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,184
What are we going to do now, Staff?

497
00:57:17,315 --> 00:57:23,452
The main door should keep the fungus out of the tunnels for a bit. We must warn the others that HQ's had it.

498
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:24,171
Right.

499
00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:25,210
Well, come on, then.

500
00:57:25,422 --> 00:57:26,528
Oh, oh no, not me.

501
00:57:26,846 --> 00:57:28,751
You're not disobeying an order, are you, Evans?

502
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,475
Now look here, Staff. If we go up there, and this stuff breaks out, we'll be trapped!

503
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:42,996
Now look, lad, you're scared, that's understandable.
But you've been in the Army long enough to know that orders is orders.
There's four people up there. If we don't warn them, they're for the chop.

504
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:47,405
So? Four of them's getting the chop - there's no reason to make it six, is there?

505
00:57:47,616 --> 00:57:50,550
I've had enough of your lip for one day. Now come on! Follow me.

506
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,371
Evans! Come back here!

507
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,780
Not on your nelly! Cheerio, Staff!

508
00:57:59,965 --> 00:58:02,698
Right, lad - I'll get you for this!

509
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:09,662
Anne...

510
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:11,732
Hey!

511
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:15,886
Stop! Come back here!

512
00:58:17,787 --> 00:58:26,223
Stop! Anne, I've been thinking. Until we know who else is working for the Intelligence, everyone must be suspect.

513
00:58:26,716 --> 00:58:27,341
Yes?

514
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,596
Well, the fewer people who know this chap's on our side, the better.

515
00:58:29,878 --> 00:58:34,441
Yes... yes, and whoever is the Intelligence is bound to know that you're controlling this Yeti.

516
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:36,957
Mmm... I know.

517
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:45,120
You are to remain here for... Do you think a minute will be enough?

518
00:58:45,364 --> 00:58:45,953
What for?

519
00:58:46,145 --> 00:58:47,051
For us to get clear.

520
00:58:47,269 --> 00:58:48,133
Perhaps.

521
00:58:48,373 --> 00:58:57,080
You are to remain here for ninety seconds, and then resume acting on orders from the Intelligence until you are told otherwise. Is that understood?

522
00:59:01,086 --> 00:59:05,923
Right. Switch off, for ninety seconds, starting from... now.

523
00:59:07,288 --> 00:59:08,197
Come on, Anne.

524
00:59:17,024 --> 00:59:18,218
It is them! Come on!

525
00:59:21,235 --> 00:59:24,093
Am I glad to see you! There's fungus at Warren Street.

526
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:24,904
Yes, I know.

527
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:26,671
Oh. What are you doing down here, anyway?

528
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,128
Well, as a matter of fact...

529
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:31,780
I'll tell you another time. Hello, Colonel.

530
00:59:34,857 --> 00:59:37,874
Glad to see you're both safe. Any luck with your gadgets?

531
00:59:38,153 --> 00:59:39,762
No. No, I'm afraid not.

532
00:59:40,052 --> 00:59:40,810
Pity.

533
00:59:41,084 --> 00:59:42,096
Any news of Victoria?

534
00:59:42,348 --> 00:59:43,816
Yes, she's at Piccadilly Station.

535
00:59:44,005 --> 00:59:44,626
Piccadilly?

536
00:59:44,836 --> 00:59:45,638
Is my father there too?

537
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:46,675
Aye, he's with her.

538
00:59:46,843 --> 00:59:47,506
Are they alright?

539
00:59:47,912 --> 00:59:48,161
Yes.

540
00:59:48,571 --> 00:59:49,447
How do you know?

541
00:59:49,645 --> 00:59:50,561
Ran across Arnold - he saw them.

542
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:51,537
Arnold?

543
00:59:51,932 --> 00:59:54,150
Arnold! But Evans said - the fungus...

544
00:59:54,473 --> 00:59:58,345
Yes, he went into it, alright, but he came out again somehow.
Says he can't remember what happened.

545
00:59:58,753 --> 01:00:00,180
Well we haven't got any time to find out.

546
01:00:00,414 --> 01:00:01,773
No, time's nearly up.

547
01:00:02,185 --> 01:00:03,462
Yes, your twenty minutes.

548
01:00:03,797 --> 01:00:05,442
Well come on, then.

549
01:00:07,715 --> 01:00:08,715
What are you going to do?

550
01:00:08,893 --> 01:00:16,172
We can't do anything until we get back to Headquarters,
and... then, if we've got time, we'll try and increase the range of the control units. Come on!

551
01:00:43,313 --> 01:00:44,341
What is it, Colonel?

552
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:45,688
Something up ahead.

553
01:00:45,954 --> 01:00:47,152
We can't go back!

554
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,813
What, fungus, you mean?

555
01:00:49,003 --> 01:00:49,498
Yes.

556
01:00:49,709 --> 01:00:51,055
Is that you, Colonel?

557
01:00:51,308 --> 01:00:53,534
It's Arnold. Hang on, Staff!

558
01:00:53,707 --> 01:00:55,116
Why isn't he in HQ?

559
01:00:57,084 --> 01:01:00,407
Sir - the fungus. It's swamped HQ.

560
01:01:00,602 --> 01:01:01,266
No!

561
01:01:01,466 --> 01:01:05,438
I'm afraid so, sir. The main doors should keep it out of the tunnels for a bit, but...

562
01:01:05,902 --> 01:01:06,715
Where's Evans?

563
01:01:07,192 --> 01:01:08,091
Scarpered, sir.

564
01:01:18,324 --> 01:01:21,812
Our time's up! We're all together - they've come to fetch us!

565
01:01:49,815 --> 01:01:57,546
H... hello! If you... if you're looking for your friend, he went that way...

566
01:01:59,384 --> 01:02:09,690
Look, you don't want me!... I'm not one of them, see?...
Driver, that's what I am... shouldn't be down here at all, really...

567
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:11,119
Hey, steady on!

568
01:02:12,504 --> 01:02:15,593
Oh, going for a walk, are we? There's lovely.

569
01:02:37,264 --> 01:02:39,051
I'm going to make a break for it, sir.

570
01:02:39,731 --> 01:02:40,672
Think you can?

571
01:02:41,066 --> 01:02:46,968
Well, it's worth a try. On the loose, sir, I might be able to do something. If only you could distract them, sir.

572
01:02:47,725 --> 01:02:48,680
Right, Staff.

573
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:55,057
I think it wants us to go on, sir.

574
01:02:55,812 --> 01:02:57,435
Right. Here we go.

575
01:03:03,494 --> 01:03:06,745
Wait!... Can't you see, he's fallen over!

576
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:11,253
Be careful, be careful!

577
01:03:20,234 --> 01:03:22,136
Where are we being taken, Professor?

578
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,870
Oh, to meet the Intelligence, I suppose.

579
01:03:30,803 --> 01:03:31,971
A pyramid!

580
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:42,977
Yes - but it's different! We... we've never seen one like this before. It's fascinating!
This must be the machine that the Intelligence intends using on the Doctor.

581
01:03:44,225 --> 01:03:46,643
Oh, no no. No, I shouldn't if I was you.

582
01:03:46,863 --> 01:03:48,134
Yes, I think perhaps you're right.

583
01:03:53,203 --> 01:03:55,377
Why didn't you tell me all this before?

584
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:56,691
Him.

585
01:03:56,926 --> 01:03:58,098
You don't think the Colonel...

586
01:03:58,290 --> 01:03:59,466
Well, you never know, do you?

587
01:04:01,852 --> 01:04:03,394
Which one is ours?

588
01:04:04,068 --> 01:04:05,665
I don't know.

589
01:04:06,002 --> 01:04:06,595
What!

590
01:04:06,878 --> 01:04:08,768
Well unfortunately I've lost track of him.

591
01:04:09,077 --> 01:04:10,415
Oh, that's a great help!

592
01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:18,004
Well, never mind, I... I want you to take this microphone and keep on calling our Yeti to you.

593
01:04:18,802 --> 01:04:20,615
How will I know I've got the right one?

594
01:04:21,283 --> 01:04:27,922
Well, you'll soon know if you haven't got the right one, won't you!
Jamie, I hope you don't suffer from claustrophobia!

595
01:04:35,752 --> 01:04:44,091
Sergeant! Oh, oh thank heavens I found you! I've been wondering down here by myself for... for ages!

596
01:04:44,477 --> 01:04:48,279
Well well well, quite forgotten about you, we had, Mr Chorley!

597
01:04:48,803 --> 01:05:02,506
Tried to get out over the surface, but... there were Yeti everywhere!
And there's this... this fungus, and fog, all around, you see, and... it's hopeless!

598
01:05:07,352 --> 01:05:09,031
Where's the control box?

599
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:11,066
Hm?

600
01:05:11,766 --> 01:05:12,993
The control box!

601
01:05:13,644 --> 01:05:14,680
It's in my pocket.

602
01:05:15,089 --> 01:05:19,077
Well, why don't you use it on these Yeti? And then maybe we can escape!

603
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:22,734
Oh, no. I must meet the Intelligence face to face.

604
01:05:23,313 --> 01:05:24,208
Doctor?

605
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:25,380
What is it?

606
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:31,198
Been thinking - the Yeti haven't noticed McCrimmon's disappearance yet.
 Not that I think he'll be able to achieve anything.

607
01:05:31,445 --> 01:05:32,261
Go on...

608
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:37,942
Well, I don't really know how to say this, but, um... there's Miss Travers and Victoria to think of, and, er...

609
01:05:38,247 --> 01:05:40,775
You mean, am I going to give myself up?

610
01:05:41,379 --> 01:05:48,276
Yes. Of course, the decision must be yours, and yours alone. But the Intelligence did promise to release Travers and Victoria.

611
01:05:48,816 --> 01:05:50,192
You believe that?

612
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:51,856
Well, why not?

613
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:54,665
Hello, we've got company.

614
01:05:58,868 --> 01:06:00,050
Hello, sir!

615
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:02,525
Evans, where the devil have you been?

616
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,430
Didn't Staff Arnold tell you, sir?

617
01:06:04,806 --> 01:06:07,475
Yes. Sounded very like desertion to me.

618
01:06:07,747 --> 01:06:17,074
Desertion? Me? Oh, good heavens, no!
No, I... I thought I'd try a single-handed and desperate attempt to rescue Professor Travers and the girl!

619
01:06:18,643 --> 01:06:20,542
Isn't Staff Arnold about?

620
01:06:20,878 --> 01:06:21,643
No.

621
01:06:21,892 --> 01:06:22,590
Good!

622
01:06:23,755 --> 01:06:24,981
Listen!...

623
01:06:25,499 --> 01:06:32,411
Now listen, everyone - when the Yeti come for you, don't struggle. Whatever you do, don't resist them!

624
01:06:33,591 --> 01:06:36,706
Don't struggle, he says! He must be joking!

625
01:06:37,472 --> 01:06:39,985
The Doctor will have to give in. There's no other choice!

626
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:43,758
Aye, aye, time to get fell in!

627
01:07:24,488 --> 01:07:25,571
Thank you!

628
01:07:41,651 --> 01:07:45,232
Father! Oh, father, are you alright?

629
01:07:45,439 --> 01:07:47,014
Yes, I'm alright again... Don't, don't worry, Anne.

630
01:07:47,212 --> 01:07:49,730
Jamie and the Doctor - where are they?

631
01:07:51,398 --> 01:07:52,174
Anne?

632
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:04,048
Come towards me... Like that, that's it... Come to...

633
01:08:09,928 --> 01:08:12,797
Right now. Raise your right arm.

634
01:08:17,387 --> 01:08:19,834
Raise your right arm!

635
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,176
Oh, what's the use?

636
01:08:31,249 --> 01:08:35,058
Well, there's nothing to be afraid of, dear. Just - just be calm.

637
01:08:37,804 --> 01:08:38,541
Doctor!

638
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:39,553
The Doctor!

639
01:08:39,772 --> 01:08:40,329
Doctor!

640
01:08:40,727 --> 01:08:41,705
What are they going to do?

641
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:43,317
Now don't worry, Victoria.

642
01:08:43,526 --> 01:08:44,205
But... I...

643
01:08:44,414 --> 01:08:46,261
Everything's under control. Don't be frightened.

644
01:08:46,578 --> 01:08:47,977
But Doctor, what are they going to do?

645
01:08:48,162 --> 01:08:51,044
Everything is under control. Tell her, Anne, you understand?

646
01:08:51,067 --> 01:08:52,003
Yes... yes, I think so.

647
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:57,834
Now listen, everyone. Don't do anything foolish! I am perfectly alright.

648
01:08:58,071 --> 01:09:06,973
Yes, he is perfectly alright. Thank you, Doctor, for being so cooperative.

649
01:09:07,613 --> 01:09:10,611
Why don't you show yourself? Who are you?

650
01:09:11,952 --> 01:09:17,118
Silence! You will know soon enough.

651
01:09:18,304 --> 01:09:18,864
Chorley!

652
01:09:19,095 --> 01:09:19,608
Good grief!

653
01:09:19,818 --> 01:09:20,404
But that horrible little man...

654
01:09:20,604 --> 01:09:21,282
You, the Intelligence?

655
01:09:21,484 --> 01:09:22,328
No... no!

656
01:09:22,515 --> 01:09:24,721
No no no, he can't be the Intelligence, he can't! It doesn't make sense!

657
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:32,005
It isn't me! It isn't me, don't you understand!
I'm not the Intelligence! The Intelligence is him!

658
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:34,530
It can't be!

659
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:38,870
Oh. Arnold

660
01:09:39,163 --> 01:09:53,015
No. Merely Arnold's lifeless body in which I have concealed myself.
But let us to work. There will be time for discussion later. In fact, all the time in the world.

661
01:09:53,998 --> 01:09:57,435
Oh... so you weren't going to let us go then, afterwards?

662
01:09:57,667 --> 01:09:58,714
Did you think he would?

663
01:09:58,984 --> 01:10:02,471
The last member of the party. Come and join us!

664
01:10:07,414 --> 01:10:08,563
Oh, Jamie!

665
01:10:08,745 --> 01:10:10,206
Victoria, are you alright?

666
01:10:10,435 --> 01:10:14,767
Your solicitude is touching. Nevertheless, it is wasting time.

667
01:10:14,979 --> 01:10:16,995
Frightened that something might go wrong?

668
01:10:18,713 --> 01:10:19,839
Join the Doctor.

669
01:10:21,746 --> 01:10:23,291
Do what he says, Jamie.

670
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:30,439
Take him!

671
01:10:30,677 --> 01:10:31,820
Leave him! Leave him be!

672
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:40,896
I must ensure your complete cooperation, Doctor. Should you prove at all unhelpful, your young friend's neck will be broken.

673
01:10:41,094 --> 01:10:46,458
You gave your word that no one would be harmed. I refuse to submit until you release Jamie!

674
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:49,097
Alright. Release the boy!

675
01:10:50,032 --> 01:10:52,924
But at the first sign of trouble from you...

676
01:10:53,101 --> 01:10:56,030
Don't worry. I will do what you say.

677
01:10:56,699 --> 01:11:00,981
Good. Into the machine, Doctor.

678
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:52,766
Soon your mind will be absorbed by the Great Intelligence. You should be very proud, Doctor - your knowledge of the past will help to shape the future of this planet.

679
01:11:53,068 --> 01:11:54,211
Just get on with it, please.

680
01:11:54,415 --> 01:11:57,311
You seem very anxious suddenly.

681
01:11:58,211 --> 01:11:59,845
I just want it over and done with.

682
01:12:01,949 --> 01:12:27,735
Submission is essential. You must understand, Doctor, that without your complete cooperation,
this transference would be of no value. Should you offer any opposition, either physical or mental, I shall be forced to punish you, or rather your friends.
Prepare for a great darkness to cloud your mind.

683
01:12:28,028 --> 01:12:29,211
Attack now! Attack the Yeti!

684
01:12:29,416 --> 01:12:30,595
Stop it! Stop it!

685
01:12:32,818 --> 01:12:33,753
Get Arnold!

686
01:12:34,598 --> 01:12:36,502
No, Jamie, no!

687
01:12:37,307 --> 01:12:38,456
Come on, get the Doctor out!

688
01:12:46,411 --> 01:12:49,723
No, you don't understand, you'll ruin everything! No!

689
01:12:49,972 --> 01:12:51,752
Professor! Anne! Give us some help!

690
01:12:53,268 --> 01:13:01,390
No! No!... No! Leave me be! You don't understand, I've got to stay here!

691
01:13:34,573 --> 01:13:36,810
Well, that's that then, innit?

692
01:13:37,011 --> 01:13:40,687
You blithering Welsh imbecile! Why can't you do what you're told?

693
01:13:41,093 --> 01:13:44,555
Hey, now just a minute, Doctor! If we hadn't pulled you out of that, you'd have been a heap of dust by now.

694
01:13:44,621 --> 01:13:48,273
You're just as bad. I told you to leave it to me! Now you've gone and ruined everything!

695
01:13:48,495 --> 01:13:51,035
Ruined every - How can we! We... we've won, haven't we?

696
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:51,730
No!

697
01:13:51,967 --> 01:13:52,883
What do you mean, Doctor?

698
01:13:53,052 --> 01:14:06,205
Oh, why didn't they leave it to me? I had crossed those wires on that helmet thing. The Intelligence wouldn't have drained me, I had... would have drained the Intelligence! As it is, all it got was a crossed circuit!

699
01:14:06,392 --> 01:14:11,834
You mean, all we've done is... is cut off its contact with Earth, it's - it's still out there in space somewhere, flying around?

700
01:14:12,045 --> 01:14:13,680
Precisely! Look!

701
01:14:17,852 --> 01:14:18,651
Oh!

702
01:14:19,012 --> 01:14:20,498
Oh, poor fellow!

703
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,455
Do you mean to say that Arnold wasn't the Intelligence?

704
01:14:23,732 --> 01:14:29,772
No. He was just a poor soldier that was taken over. He was probably one of the first to disappear.

705
01:14:30,952 --> 01:14:32,565
You mean it might come back?

706
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:37,167
Well, it's still around, isn't it? I've failed.

707
01:14:37,403 --> 01:14:38,567
Nonsense, man!

708
01:14:38,754 --> 01:14:39,885
You were marvellous.

709
01:14:40,087 --> 01:14:41,040
Yes. Great victory.

710
01:14:41,233 --> 01:14:41,987
I doubt it.

711
01:14:42,181 --> 01:14:45,243
No - you were a hero, and you know it.

712
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:47,180
You don't really think so. Do you?

713
01:14:47,335 --> 01:14:48,127
Yes, yes I do.

714
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:52,551
You've got to face facts, old man. Tomorrow you're going to be a household word, a national figure...

715
01:14:52,584 --> 01:14:53,355
Oh no, oh no!

716
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:55,314
Yeah! I want you on my television programme, and...

717
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:57,147
Jamie! Victoria! Come along, it's time we left!

718
01:14:57,346 --> 01:14:58,275
...but the Press Conference, Doctor!

719
01:14:58,495 --> 01:14:59,103
Goodbye!

720
01:14:59,339 --> 01:15:02,727
But Doctor, Doctor, you... you can't go yet, there are a lot of things I want to discuss with you!

721
01:15:02,896 --> 01:15:04,269
I'm sorry, Travers, we have to go.

722
01:15:04,468 --> 01:15:05,437
Where are you going?

723
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:08,050
Covent Garden! Come along. Come along, Jamie.

724
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:10,864
Bye!... Bye.

725
01:15:13,147 --> 01:15:14,136
Where's he going?

726
01:15:14,887 --> 01:15:17,714
Huh? Oh, er, back to his TARDIS, I suppose.

727
01:15:17,765 --> 01:15:21,112
You mean this, uh, this time machine thing, it really exists?

728
01:15:21,728 --> 01:15:27,625
Y... well I, er... oh, explain it to him, Anne, will you?

729
01:15:27,897 --> 01:15:30,019
Colonel, I think we'd better check up top, don't you?

730
01:15:30,188 --> 01:15:32,072
Right, Professor. Evans!

731
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:33,827
Father - father, I...

732
01:15:34,033 --> 01:15:39,872
Now don't you go, Miss Travers, I'd er, I'd like you to explain all about this, this time machine for me.

733
01:15:40,242 --> 01:15:42,129
Oh dear...!

734
01:15:43,791 --> 01:15:46,447
Well, where do we go? Which is the way to Covent Garden?

735
01:15:46,721 --> 01:15:49,412
Oh, don't ask me. I've completely lost my bearings.

736
01:15:49,704 --> 01:15:51,734
All these tunnels look the same to me.

737
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:53,271
Come on, let's try this way.

738
01:15:53,511 --> 01:15:55,471
Well it doesn't matter, anyway. I mean, there's no danger, is there?

739
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:59,383
Well, not from the Yeti, no, but who knows, they might suddenly start the trains again! Come on!

740
01:15:59,667 --> 01:16:00,204
Trains?

741
01:16:00,402 --> 01:16:00,852
Oh!

742
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:01,635
Come on!

743
02:00:53,014 --> 02:00:53,948
There's someone there...

744
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:54,703
What?

745
02:00:54,912 --> 02:00:55,538
There!

746
02:00:55,736 --> 02:00:59,650
Who's that? Who is it? D'you see who it was?

747
02:00:59,871 --> 02:01:02,283
No. Do you think it could have been...

748
02:01:02,515 --> 02:01:07,868
The Intelligence? If only we could do something!

749
02:01:08,443 --> 02:01:10,799
I'm sure the Doctor will think of something.

750
02:01:11,054 --> 02:01:16,053
No, not this time, Victoria. The Doctor would never risk the chance of the Intelligence harming you.

751
02:01:16,957 --> 02:01:18,644
You mean he'll just give in?

752
02:01:20,123 --> 02:01:24,031
Yes, I'm afraid so. Afraid there's no alternative.

753
02:01:24,273 --> 02:02:00,875
Yes, you're right, Professor. He has no alternative. I am sorry not to be here to welcome you personally, but I am sure you will not be offended. After all, the guest of honour is the Doctor - he, I am sure, will cooperate, as I advise you to do. Any attempt to interfere would be pointless. My Yeti can destroy you so easily.

754
02:02:04,441 --> 02:02:14,857
It's all my fault! If I hadn't tampered with that sphere - people killed, London invaded, all because of my wretched curiosity!

755
02:02:15,155 --> 02:02:16,738
Don't blame yourself, Professor.

756
02:02:16,952 --> 02:02:21,587
Why not? I... I've sacrificed you all! And for what?

757
02:06:04,345 --> 02:06:06,650
My, my, my, we are in a state, aren't we, sir?

758
02:06:10,449 --> 02:06:16,973
Yes... alright... no, I'm fine. I've just been so scared, that's all!

759
02:06:17,181 --> 02:06:19,029
'S alright, sir, nothing to be ashamed of.

760
02:06:19,529 --> 02:06:20,285
Yes.

761
02:06:21,810 --> 02:06:24,678
There's just one thing that puzzles me though, sir.

762
02:06:25,038 --> 02:06:27,728
Oh, what's that?

763
02:06:28,389 --> 02:06:31,877
How you managed to exist all this time - why didn't the Yetis get you?

764
02:06:35,724 --> 02:06:38,027
I'm sorry, what are you suggesting? You're not suggesting that I...

765
02:06:38,309 --> 02:06:44,339
Oh no, sir, I was just wondering, that's all. I think perhaps you'd better come along with me, don't you, sir? Come on, now.
