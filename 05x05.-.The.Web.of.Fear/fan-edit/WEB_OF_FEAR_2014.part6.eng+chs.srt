00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,184
What are we going to do now, Staff?
我们现在打算做什么，Staff？

2
00:57:17,315 --> 00:57:23,452
The main door should keep the fungus out of the tunnels for a bit./ We must warn the others that HQ's had it.
这道门应该能把真菌网挡住一阵
我们必须警告其他人总部已经沦陷了

3
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:24,171
Right.
是

4
00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:25,210
Well, come on, then.
那就快来

00:57:25,422 --> 00:57:26,528
Oh, oh no, not me.
噢，不，不要找我

6
00:57:26,846 --> 00:57:28,751
You're not disobeying an order, are you, Evans?
你不服从命令是吗，Evans？

7
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,475
Now look here, Staff. If we go up there, and this stuff breaks out, we'll be trapped!

8
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:42,996
Now look, lad, you're scared, that's understandable. /36.1
听着小子，你害怕，这是可以理解德
But you've been in the Army long enough to know that orders is orders. /39.1
但你在军队待得够久了，知道命令就是命令
There's four people up there. If we don't warn them, they're for the chop.
上面有四个人，如果我们不警告他们，他们就任凭宰割了

9
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:47,405
So? Four of them's getting the chop - there's no reason to make it six, is there?
所以啊，他们四个被宰割，没理由要变成六个啊，对不？

10
00:57:47,616 --> 00:57:50,550
I've had enough of your lip for one day. Now come on! Follow me.
今天一天我算是受够你那张破嘴了。现在快点，跟着我

11
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,371
Evans! Come back here!
Evans！回来！

12
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,780
Not on your nelly! Cheerio, Staff!

13
00:57:59,965 --> 00:58:02,698
Right, lad - I'll get you for this!

14
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:09,662
Anne...

15
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:11,732
Hey!

16
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:15,886
Stop! Come back here!

17
00:58:17,787 --> 00:58:26,223
Stop! Anne, I've been thinking. Until we know who else is working for the Intelligence, everyone must be suspect.
停下！Anne，我一直在想。在我们确切知道谁在为大智慧工作以前，每个人都是有嫌疑的

18
00:58:26,716 --> 00:58:27,341
Yes?

19
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,596
Well, the fewer people who know this chap's on our side, the better.
知道这个家伙在我们这边的人，越少越好

00:58:29,878 --> 00:58:34,441
Yes... yes, and whoever is the Intelligence is bound to know that you're controlling this Yeti.
是的，不管谁是大智慧，他肯定知道是你在控制这个雪怪

21
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:36,957
Mmm... I know.

You are to remain here for... Do you think a minute will be enough?
你在这里停留...你觉得一分钟够不够？

23
00:58:45,364 --> 00:58:45,953
What for?
够干什么？

24
00:58:46,145 --> 00:58:47,051
For us to get clear.
够我们俩闪人

25
00:58:47,269 --> 00:58:48,133
Perhaps.
也许吧

26
00:58:48,373 --> 00:58:57,080
You are to remain here for ninety seconds, and then resume acting on orders from the Intelligence

until you are told otherwise. Is that understood?

Right. Switch off, for ninety seconds, starting from... now.

00:59:07,288 --> 00:59:08,197

It is them! Come on!

Oh. What are you doing down here, anyway?
噢，你在这下面干什么？

33
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,128
Well, as a matter of fact...

00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:31,780
I'll tell you another time. Hello, Colonel.

00:59:49,645 --> 00:59:50,561
Ran across Arnold - he saw them.
碰到了 Arnold，他看见过他们

00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:51,537

Arnold! But Evans said - the fungus...
Arnold！但 Evans 说过，那些真菌....

Says he can't remember what happened.

Well we haven't got any time to find out.

No, time's nearly up.

01:00:02,185 --> 01:00:03,462

What are you going to do?

No!

01:01:05,902 --> 01:01:06,715

Scarpered, sir.

你...你好！如果你...你在找你的朋友，他去那边了...

Driver, that's what I am... shouldn't be down here at all, really...
我说，你不会想要我的！... 我不是他们中的一员，明白？

Hey, steady on!

Think you can?

 If only you could distract them, sir.
至少，值得试一试。fix me

I think it wants us to go on, sir.

Wait!... Can't you see, he's fallen over!

是的，但有些不一样，我们...之前从没见过这个样子的。很吸引人！

这肯定就是大智慧说要用在博士身上的那个机器

 and keep on calling our Yeti to you.
这个，别管了...我要你拿着这个麦克风

How will I know I've got the right one?
我怎么知道过来的对的？

102

I've been wondering down here by myself for... for ages!
中士, 感谢老天我找到你了！
我一个人在这下面转悠了好几个世纪了！

喔喔喔，我们都快忘记你了，Chorley 先生

试过逃到地面上去，但是...到处都有雪怪！

而这里有这个...真菌网，有雾，到处都是，你看，还有... 完全没希望

It's in my pocket.

Oh, no. I must meet the Intelligence face to face.

What is it?
什么事？

115
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:31,198
Been thinking - the Yeti haven't noticed McCrimmon's disappearance yet./29.5
Not that I think he'll be able to achieve anything.
我在想，雪怪还没有留意到 McCrimmon 已经不见了
倒不是说我觉得他能搞定什么

Go on...
继续...

117
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:37,942

这个...我真不知道该怎么说，但是... 有 Travers 小姐和 Victoria 要考虑，还有 ...

You mean, am I going to give myself up?
你是说，我是不是会放弃我自己？

119

Yes. Of course, the decision must be yours, and yours alone. /?
But the Intelligence did promise to release Travers and Victoria.
是的。当然，决定是你自己下，一个人下
但大智慧的确承诺过会放了 Travers 和 Victoria

120
01:05:48,816 --> 01:05:50,192
You believe that?

Evans, where the devil have you been?

01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,430
Didn't Staff Arnold tell you, sir?
Staff Arnold 没有告诉你吗，头儿？

01:06:04,806 --> 01:06:07,475
Yes. Sounded very like desertion to me.
是。听起来我像是被抛弃了

Desertion? Me? Oh, good heavens, no! /11.2
抛弃？我？噢，老天，不会！

不，我还想我要单枪匹马死命去救 Travers 教授和这个女孩儿呢

Isn't Staff Arnold about?
Staff Arnold 在这附近吗？

130
01:06:20,878 --> 01:06:21,643
No.
不在

Whatever you do, don't resist them!

Don't struggle, he says! He must be joking!

The Doctor will have to give in. There's no other choice!
博士只能投降，没有别的选择

137
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:43,758
Aye, aye, time to get fell in!

不不！... 不！别管我！你们没明白，我必须待在这里！

207
01:13:34,573 --> 01:13:36,810
Well, that's that then, innit?

208
01:13:37,011 --> 01:13:40,687
You blithering Welsh imbecile! Why can't you do what you're told?
你个爱叨叨的威尔士草包！为什么不能跟你说什么就做什么呢？

209
01:13:41,093 --> 01:13:44,555
Hey, now just a minute, Doctor! If we hadn't pulled you out of that, you'd have been a heap of dust by now.
嗨，现在等一下，博士！如果我们没把你从那里面拉出来，你现在已经是一堆黄土了

你就好了？我告诉过你别管我！现在你破坏了一切！

01:13:51,967 --> 01:13:52,883
What do you mean, Doctor?
你什么意思，博士

214
01:13:53,052 --> 01:13:58,205
Oh, why didn't they leave it to me? 
I had crossed those wires on that helmet thing. 
噢，为什么他们就不能别管我呢？我已经反转了那个头盔里面的项圈

215
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:04,000
The Intelligence wouldn't have drained me, I had... would have drained the Intelligence! 
大智慧吸收不了我的意识，我本来...还可以吸收他的！

216
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,020
As it is, all it got was a crossed circuit!
当前来说，就只有一个反转的线圈x

217
01:14:06,392 --> 01:14:08,834
You mean, all we've done is... is cut off its contact with Earth, 
你是说，我们所干的事情是... 切断了他跟地球的联系

218
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:11,834
it's - it's still out there in space somewhere, flying around?
他，他还在太空中某个地方，飘着？

219
01:14:12,045 --> 01:14:13,680
Precisely! Look!
正是！看！

220
01:14:17,852 --> 01:14:18,651
Oh!
噢！

221
01:14:19,012 --> 01:14:20,498
Oh, poor fellow!
噢，可怜的家伙！

222
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,455
Do you mean to say that Arnold wasn't the Intelligence?
你的意思是说 Arnold 不是大智慧？

223
01:14:23,732 --> 01:14:29,772
No. He was just a poor soldier that was taken over. He was probably one of the first to disappear.
不，他只是个被附体的可怜士兵。他可能是第一个消失的

224
01:14:30,952 --> 01:14:32,565
You mean it might come back?
你的意思是他还可能回来？

225
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:37,167
Well, it's still around, isn't it? I've failed.
那，他在在附近，是吗？我已经失败了

226
01:14:37,403 --> 01:14:38,567

No - you were a hero, and you know it.

231
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:47,180
You don't really think so. Do you?
你其实并不这么想，是吗？

232
01:14:47,335 --> 01:14:48,127
Yes, yes I do.
我是这么想

233
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:52,551
You've got to face facts, old man. Tomorrow you're going to be a household word, a national figure...
你得面对事实，老头。明天你将成为一个家喻户晓的词, 一个全国性的人物.....

234
01:14:52,584 --> 01:14:53,355
Oh no, oh no!
噢不，噢不！

235
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:55,314
Yeah! I want you on my television programme, and...
好！我要你上我的电视节目，还要...

236
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:57,147
Jamie! Victoria! Come along, it's time we left!
Jamie! Victoria! 快过来，我们该走了

237
01:14:57,346 --> 01:14:58,275
...but the Press Conference, Doctor!
...但是新闻发布会，博士

238
01:14:58,495 --> 01:14:59,103
Goodbye!
再见！

239
01:14:59,339 --> 01:15:02,727
But Doctor, Doctor, you... you can't go yet, there are a lot of things I want to discuss with you!
但是，博士，博士，你...你还不能走。还有好多事情我需要和你讨论！

240
01:15:02,896 --> 01:15:04,269
I'm sorry, Travers, we have to go.

Where's he going?

Huh? Oh, er, back to his TARDIS, I suppose.
啥？哦，回他的 TARDIS，我估计

246
01:15:17,765 --> 01:15:21,112
You mean this, uh, this time machine thing, it really exists?
你是说这个...这个时间机器，他真的存在？

247
01:15:21,728 --> 01:15:27,625
Y... well I, er... oh, explain it to him, Anne, will you?
这个...噢，你跟他解释一下吧，Anne，行吗？

248
01:15:27,897 --> 01:15:30,019
Colonel, I think we'd better check up top, don't you?
上校，我想我们最好上去坚持一下，你觉得呢

249
01:15:30,188 --> 01:15:32,072

250
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:33,827
Father - father, I...
父亲，父亲，我...

251

Now don't you go, Miss Travers, I'd er, I'd like you to explain all about this, this time machine for me.
你现在别走，Travers 小姐，我要...我要你给我讲解一下这个，这个时间机器

252

Oh dear...!
噢天啊....！

253
01:15:43,791 --> 01:15:46,447
Well, where do we go? Which is the way to Covent Garden?
那，我们去哪儿？哪条路是去科文特花园的？

254
01:15:46,721 --> 01:15:49,412
Oh, don't ask me. I've completely lost my bearings.
噢，别问我，我完全失去了方向

255
01:15:49,704 --> 01:15:51,734
All these tunnels look the same to me.
所有的隧道在我看来都是一样

256
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:53,271
Come on, let's try this way.
来吧，我们试试这边

257
01:15:53,511 --> 01:15:55,471
Well it doesn't matter, anyway. I mean, there's no danger, is there?
不管哪边都没有关系，我是说，没有危险了，是吗？

258
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:59,383
Well, not from the Yeti, no, but who knows, they might suddenly start the trains again! Come on!
只是没有雪怪的危险。但是，谁知道呢，他们可能突然开动一条列车过来！快点！

259
01:15:59,667 --> 01:16:00,204
Trains?
列车？

260
01:16:00,402 --> 01:16:00,852
Oh!
噢！

261
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:01,635
Come on!
快点！

262
02:00:53,014 --> 02:00:53,948
There's someone there...

263
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:54,703
What?

264
02:00:54,912 --> 02:00:55,538
There!

265
02:00:55,736 --> 02:00:59,650
Who's that? Who is it? D'you see who it was?

266
02:00:59,871 --> 02:01:02,283
No. Do you think it could have been...

267
02:01:02,515 --> 02:01:07,868
The Intelligence? If only we could do something!

268
02:01:08,443 --> 02:01:10,799
I'm sure the Doctor will think of something.

269
02:01:11,054 --> 02:01:16,053
No, not this time, Victoria. The Doctor would never risk the chance of the Intelligence harming you.

270
02:01:16,957 --> 02:01:18,644
You mean he'll just give in?

271
02:01:20,123 --> 02:01:24,031
Yes, I'm afraid so. Afraid there's no alternative.

272
02:01:24,273 --> 02:02:00,875
Yes, you're right, Professor. He has no alternative. I am sorry not to be here to welcome you personally, but I am sure you will not be offended. After all, the guest of honour is the Doctor - he, I am sure, will cooperate, as I advise you to do. Any attempt to interfere would be pointless. My Yeti can destroy you so easily.

273
02:02:04,441 --> 02:02:14,857
It's all my fault! If I hadn't tampered with that sphere - people killed, London invaded, all because of my wretched curiosity!

274
02:02:15,155 --> 02:02:16,738
Don't blame yourself, Professor.

275
02:02:16,952 --> 02:02:21,587
Why not? I... I've sacrificed you all! And for what?

276
02:06:04,345 --> 02:06:06,650
My, my, my, we are in a state, aren't we, sir?

277
02:06:10,449 --> 02:06:16,973
