1
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:26,312
All right, Corporal. Nip back and tell Captain Knight
it's all clear up 'ere. And get 'em to get a shift on!
好了, 下士．摸回去告诉 Knight 队长这里没问题了．再让他们换个班

2
00:27:26,523 --> 00:27:27,646
Righto, Staff.
好的, Staff

3
00:27:30,436 --> 00:27:32,249
This looks familiar - it's around this corner.
这个地方看起来眼熟 - 应该就在这个角落

4
00:27:33,094 --> 00:27:33,922
Oh no!
噢, 不！

5
00:27:34,443 --> 00:27:35,811
Oh, we can't get to the TARDIS!
噢, 我们没法到 TARDIS 那里了

6
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:39,465
No, Victoria, I'm afraid we can't.
不能, Victoria, 恐怕不能了

7
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:41,499
What's happened to Chorley, then?
Chorley 怎么啦？

8
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:47,495
That's what I'm wondering. Did he reach the TARDIS
before the fungus, or... or did he not?
这也是我好奇的地方．他是在大网之前到达了 TARDIS 吗？或者他没有？

9
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:50,452
You mean to say, he could have got to the TARDIS
and already have taken off in it?
你的意思是说, 他可能已经到达了 TARDIS, 并且已经把它开走了？

10
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:51,896
I don't know...
我不知道

11
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:53,060
Hey, come back, Doctor!
嘿, 回来, 博士！

12
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:55,526
It's alright, Jamie, I'm not going to do anything silly. I...
没事的, Jamie, 我不会做任何傻事的

13
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:58,326
I just want to try and get a little bit for an analysis.
我只是想试着弄一点拿回去分析

14
00:27:58,618 --> 00:27:59,616
Oh Jamie, stop him!
噢, Jamie, 拦住他！

15
00:27:59,843 --> 00:28:01,027
It's alright, Victoria.
没事的, Victoria

16
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,083
Has anyone got a box?
谁有个盒子不？

17
00:28:05,772 --> 00:28:06,976
I've got my tobacco tin.
我有一个香烟盒

18
00:28:07,315 --> 00:28:08,515
Oh, splendid.
噢, 很棒

19
00:28:08,742 --> 00:28:09,974
But then, it's got tobacco in it.
不过呢, 里面还有香烟呢

20
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:10,888
Never mind.
没关系

21
00:28:11,112 --> 00:28:16,858
Eh!... Oh, alright. I only hope you think the sacrifice is worth it!
诶！...哦, 好吧．我只是期望你觉得我的牺牲是值得的

22
00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:19,996
Hold the tin for me, would you, Evans?
帮我拿着这个铁盒, 行吗, Evans？

23
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,427
Gone and set it off! Come on, now!

24
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:28,487
Oh, it's horrible!
噢, 太可怕了

25
00:28:28,678 --> 00:28:29,888
Go on, Doctor, get it out!
继续, 博士, 把它弄出来

26
00:28:30,103 --> 00:28:31,065
Hold the tin underneath!

27
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:34,596
There we are - now back, everyone, quickly!

28
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:43,686
Hello, Staff. It's alright, it's just Staff Arnold!
你好, Staff．没事的．是 Staff Arnold

29
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:48,776
One of these days, Evans my lad,
you're going to creep up onto someone once too often!

30
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:50,830
Well, that's life, innit Staff?
嗯, 这就是生命, 对吧 Staff

31
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:52,074
Any luck at Holborn?
Holborn 怎样了？

32
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:53,197
No - fungus.

33
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,365
Same back there.

34
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,590
Right. I'll tell the Colonel. You lot had better
get back to HQ. We'll be along in a few minutes.
好, 我会汇报给上校．你们最好回到总部去．我们过几分钟也会回去

35
00:28:58,855 --> 00:29:01,176
Come on, Jamie, I'll just show this bit of fungus to Travers.
快来, Jamie, 我要把这点真菌展示给 Travers

36
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:01,992
Right.
好嘞

37
00:29:06,729 --> 00:29:08,683
Hey, look at this!
嘿, 看看这个

38
00:29:09,094 --> 00:29:11,574
Good Lord! That's Yeti!
上帝！那是雪怪！

39
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:13,791
You don't think they may still be here?
你绝对它们已经不在这里了？

40
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:14,717
I hope not!
我期望不在了！

41
00:29:15,105 --> 00:29:16,028
Oh, Doctor!
噢, 博士！

42
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,632
D'you reckon they have?
你觉得他们已经得手了吗？

43
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:25,783
Have what?
得手什么？

44
00:29:26,002 --> 00:29:27,535
Taken him? Like she said?
fixme

45
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:35,563
Yes, I'm very much afraid they have./
But why? Why didn't they just kill him? Unless...
是的, 恐怕它们真的已经得手了．不顾为什么？它们为什么不直接杀了他？除非．．．

46
00:29:35,812 --> 00:29:36,695
Yes?
什么？

47
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:38,498
Well, unless they had a use for him.
除非它们拿他另有用途

48
00:29:40,658 --> 00:29:42,758
Ah, Doctor. What's this I hear about Travers?
啊, 博士, fixme

49
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:52,090
'Scuse me, sir, but I think you ought to come to the Ops Room.
对不起, 先生, 但恐怕你得到操作室来一趟

50
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:53,219
Why? What's happening?
为什么？怎么了？

51
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,231
That fungus stuff, it's on the move again!
那些真菌, 又在移动了！

52
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:08,744
It's like a spider's web, ain't it?
看起来像是蜘蛛网, 是不？

53
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:13,254
Yes. And we're the flies, alright, but... where is the spider?
是的, 而我们就是苍蝇．好吧, 不过...蜘蛛在哪儿？

54
00:30:13,876 --> 00:30:15,614
Better give the others a hand, Corporal.
最好给其他人帮一下, 下士

55
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:16,429
Sir.
是！

56
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:20,690
Doctor. Been thinking about what you were saying earlier, /20.7
博士, 我在想你之前说的话

57
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:24,690
about someone here in HQ being responsible for all this. /25.1
你说是总部的某个人得为这些情况负责

58
00:30:24,751 --> 00:30:25,690
Could it have been Travers?
有可能是 Travers 吗？

59
00:30:26,184 --> 00:30:27,024
I doubt it.
我表示怀疑

60
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:29,716
Well, after all he has disappeared.
但是, 不管怎么说他已经消失了

61
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:34,815
Yes - so has Chorley. I'd say he was a much more likely suspect.
是的, Chorley 也消失了．要我说他更像有嫌疑

62
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:35,877
True.
的确

63
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:41,471
On the other hand, of course, whoever is in league
with the Intelligence could still be amongst us here.
另一方面来看, 不管谁是大智慧的同盟, 他都有可能还在我们中间

64
00:30:42,782 --> 00:30:45,622
That's a fact of which I am uncomfortably aware./45.6
我也意思意识到了这个事实, 这一点让我很不安

65
00:30:45,782 --> 00:30:49,822
But tell me, Doctor, this Intelligence - exactly what is it?
不过跟我说说, 博士, 这个大智慧到底是个什么东西

66
00:30:50,404 --> 00:30:53,617
Well I wish I could give you a precise answer. /53.3
嗯, 我期望我能够给你一个确切的答案

67
00:30:53,704 --> 00:30:58,617
Perhaps the best way to describe it is
a sort of formless, shapeless thing /58
也许最好的描述是, 它是一种无形无体的东西

68
00:30:58,704 --> 00:31:04,617
floating about in space like a cloud of mist,
only... with a mind and will.
像一团云雾一样漂浮在太空中, 只有意识和意志

69
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:06,810
What's it after? What's it want?
它在追求什么？它想要什么？

70
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:11,352
I wish I knew. The only thing I know for sure
is that it brought me here.
我期望我知道．我唯一确切知道的就是, 它把我带到这里了

71
00:31:11,854 --> 00:31:13,074
Brought you here?
把你带到这里？

72
00:31:13,267 --> 00:31:15,438
Yes, been wondering how you got here.
是．我也好奇你是怎么到这里的

73
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:20,471
Yes, well I... I don't think there's any harm
in telling you now. I... /20.5
这个...我觉得现在告诉你们也没有什么问题, 我...

74
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:23,971
I have a craft, that travels in time and space.
我有一艘飞船, 可以穿越时间和空间

75
00:31:25,023 --> 00:31:27,253
Oh, come now Doctor, you can't expect me to...
噢, 得了博士, 你不会指望我会...

76
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:32,134
This craft of yours, this time-space craft.
Could it get us out of here?
你的这个飞船, 时空飞船, 它能把我们带出这里吗？

77
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,418
Well, yes - but it's at Covent Garden!
嗯, 可以 - 但它现在在科文特花园

78
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:37,006
What does it look like?
它是什么样子的？

79
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:39,345
It's a police box.
是个警察亭

80
00:31:39,612 --> 00:31:41,464
Oh really, Colonel, surely you're not...
噢, 真的吗, 上校, 你不会...

81
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:45,012
So - if we could rescue that craft, you could take us out?
这么说, 如果我们能弄回那个飞船, 你就能把我们带出去？

82
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,018
Yes, yes I could, but I have to stay here and finish Travers' work!
是的, 我可以．但我现在必须呆在这里, 完成 Travers 的工作

83
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:54,409
Ah, Doctor. Miss Travers is feeling alright now,
and would like to see you right away.
啊, 博士, Travers 小姐现在感觉没事了, 现在想马上见你

84
00:31:54,633 --> 00:31:57,184
Very good, Jamie. Excuse me, gentlemen, please.
很好, Jamie．请原谅, 先生们

85
00:31:57,453 --> 00:31:57,967
Yes.
好的

86
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:02,095
Well, I've heard some stories in my time, but that one really takes...
哈, 我听过不少故事, 那个故事还真是...

87
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:03,193
So you don't believe him?
看来你不相信他？

88
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:07,269
No, of course not, sir! The whole idea is screwy. A police box!
不, 当然不, 头儿！整个故事都很怪诞, 警察亭！

89
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:11,024
Well whether you think it foolish or not, we are going to rescue that craft.
好了, 不管你觉得它是不是傻, 我们都要去找那艘飞船

90
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,837
Oh, but sir! Our job...
噢, 但是头儿！我们的任务...

91
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:15,433
Captain Knight. The Army has failed to defeat this menace./15.2
Knight 队长, 在消除这个威胁上面, 军队已经失败了

92
00:32:15,526 --> 00:32:18,833
Now the Doctor thinks he might succeed. Personally, I doubt it. /18.8
现在博士觉得他可能成功．个人来说，我也表示怀疑

93
00:32:18,926 --> 00:32:20,633
But if we stay here, we're as good as dead. /20.8
但如果我们待在这里, 我们还是死翘翘

94
00:32:20,726 --> 00:32:25,633
Therefore I do not intend leaving any escape route unexplored,
however... screwy you may think it.
所以我不会可能还有一条路而不去尝试, 不过这条路你觉得如何怪诞

95
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:26,774
Oh, surely Colonel...
噢, 好吧上校

96
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:28,411
Let's get on with it, shall we, Knight?
我们开动吧, 行不, Knight？

97
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:29,432
Sir.
是！

98
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:36,914
But... but there must be a chance! If the Doctor says...
但是...这里肯定还有可能的！如果博士说...

99
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:42,254
No, the soldiers could comb these tunnels
for a fortnight and still never find him. /42.2
不, 士兵们在隧道里来回排查两周, 也不一定能找到他

100
00:32:42,358 --> 00:32:45,554
I'm afraid your father's been taken by the Intelligence. /45.5
我担心你的父亲已经被大智慧给抓走了

101
00:32:45,658 --> 00:32:51,054
The only way that we can save him
is by finding the central control source.
我们能救他的唯一途径是找到中心控制源

102
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:53,046
Aye, if he's anywhere, that's where he'll be.
是, 如果他在什么地方, fixme

103
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:57,180
But why? Why him? Why not me, or one of the soldiers, or...
但是为什么？为什么是他, 而不是我, 也不是其他哪个士兵, 抑或...

104
00:32:57,357 --> 00:33:04,321
Yes, I know. Tell me, what was your father working on /33.2
是的, 我知道．告诉我, 你父亲之前在研究什么？

105
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,121
just before the Yeti broke in, Anne?
在雪怪出现之前, Anne?

106
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:11,360
Um... oh, we were ready to test the sphere with the control unit,/11.0
嗯...哦, 我们已经准备好要用控制器来测试球体了

107
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,960
but I don't see what this has to do with anything, Doctor.
但我看不出来这跟这些有什么关系, 博士

108
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:17,721
But don't you? If he was near to success...
看不出吗？如果他快要成功了...

109
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:19,006
That's why they took him!
那就是它们抓走他的原因

110
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,665
Well, it's a possibility, isn't it? /21.3
对，这是有可能的，是不？

111
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,565
Now Anne, do you feel strong enough to come back to the laboratory?
现在，Anne，你觉得你恢复得怎样了，可以回到实验室吗？

112
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:24,779
Yes, yes of course.
可以，当然可以

113
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:25,732
Anything we can do?
我们能做点什么？

114
00:33:25,906 --> 00:33:26,883
No, no, you just take it easy, Jamie.
不，不用，你就休息一下吧，Jamie

115
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:31,037
What's the matter?
怎么了？

116
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:33,361
I've been thinking about what the Doctor said. /33.6
我在想博士所说的是

117
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:36,561
Anything we do, the Intelligence always knows!
不管我们做什么，大智慧总是自知道！

118
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:40,379
Aye, but I wouldn't let it worry you. The Doctor will soon find a way out.
是，不过我不会让这个事烦你。博士很快会找到解决办法得到

119
00:33:40,828 --> 00:33:42,321
I wish I could believe that.
真期望我能接受这个

120
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:48,926
Oh yes. Yes, this seems to be in order, Anne.
哦是的，是的，这似乎是正常的，Anne

121
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:55,289
My father didn't want it put together until this was in proper order.
我父亲不想在一切就绪之前不想把组合拼起来

122
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,144
Very wise. Let's have a look at this...
很明智。我们来看看这个

123
00:33:58,261 --> 00:34:03,225
Oh yes, yes... My word, this is a splendid piece of work, Anne.
啊是，是的...我得说，这是一件了不起的作品，Anne

124
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:03,934
Thank you.
谢谢你

125
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,307
Yes, this should control the sphere, alright, but /06.3
是的，这可以操纵球体，很好

125
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:09,207
would it override the commands issued by the Intelligence, I wonder?
但它能否压制大智慧发出的命令呢，我想知道

126
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:12,840
No. No, I'm afraid it won't. I just didn't have the time.
Do you think we can do it.
不，恐怕不能。我还没有时间来弄。你觉得我们可以搞定吗？

127
00:34:13,028 --> 00:34:15,029
Oh, we can do it, if you've got the right bits and pieces.
哦，我们可以搞。只要你有正确的零配件

128
00:34:16,022 --> 00:34:18,997
Hope I'm not disturbing, Doctor, but Staff asked me to give you this.
期望我没打扰你，博士。不过 Staff 让我把这个交给你

129
00:34:20,632 --> 00:34:21,750
Where'd you get this?
你从哪儿得到这个的？

130
00:34:21,985 --> 00:34:24,211
On the floor, by that young lad Weams, it was.
地上, Weams 那个年轻小伙子捡到的

131
00:34:24,788 --> 00:34:27,578
But this is what brought the Yeti to the explosives store!
但就是这个东西把雪怪引到炸药储藏室的

132
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:31,178
It's obviously been reprogrammed as a homing device,
and you've given it to me!
很显然它被改成了一个发出归巢信号的装置, 而你居然把它给了我！

133
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,949
Here! You don't think I had anything to do with these Yeti, do you?
嘿, 你不是认为我跟这些雪怪有什么关系吧, 是吗？

134
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,675
Doctor! The other models - they've gone!
博士！其它的模型呢, 不见了！

135
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:44,404
Well don't look at me!
I didn't want to come down here in the first place
别看我啊！我一开始就不想下到这里来

136
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:47,304
I shouldn't be down here at all, really. Driver, I am, see.
我根本就完全不该到这里来, 真的, 我只是个司机, 对不

137
00:34:47,372 --> 00:34:50,304
You'd better have this, before you say I've nicked it.
你最好拿走这个, 免得你又说我藏匿了它

138
00:34:50,694 --> 00:34:51,533
Thank you.
谢谢你

139
00:34:51,795 --> 00:34:53,753
And I'll have the tin back, when you've finished with it.
而且等你用完了, 我还要把铁盒拿回来的

140
00:34:54,378 --> 00:34:58,034
Don't look so unhappy - we're all under suspicion,
you know, including me.
别那么不高兴 - 我们所有人都有嫌疑, 你知道的, 包括我

141
00:34:58,275 --> 00:34:58,948
Hmm!
哼！

142
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:01,373
What's in the tin, Doctor?
铁盒里面有什么, 博士？

143
00:35:01,777 --> 00:35:05,907
It's the fungus from the tunnel. I thought if
we examined it, it might give us a clue.
是在隧道里面采集的真菌, 我想如果我们研究一下它的话, 也许会有点线索

144
00:35:05,977 --> 00:35:10,007
I must get this dismantled. It's like holding a time bomb.
我得把这个破解掉, 感觉像拿着一颗定时炸弹似的

145
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:16,962
So my party will get above ground and approach
Covent Garden by Neal Street. Is that clear?
我的人会到地面上去, 从尼尔街往科文特花园站靠拢, 清楚了吗？

146
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,586
Now Staff here will be taking the trolley through the tunnel,
Staff 现在就把推车从这里弄到隧道里面去

You picked your two men, Staff?
跟我们到达的时间应该一样, 我期望．你选两个你的人带上, Staff？

Yes, sir. Lane and Evans.
是, 头儿, 就 Lane 和 Evans 吧

148
00:35:25,772 --> 00:35:29,099
Right. Now as soon as we get there,
we shall be looking for a police box.
好．等我们一到那里, 就开始寻找一个警察亭

149
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:30,432
A police box, sir?
一个警察亭吗, 头儿？

150
00:35:30,594 --> 00:35:34,936
Yes, a police box. Now I want that box either out of the station/
or onto the trolley as quickly as possible. Is that understood?
是的, 一个警察亭．现在我想要的是尽快将它弄出站外或者弄到推车上, 清楚了吗？

151
00:35:35,114 --> 00:35:35,670
Yes, sir.
是, 长官

152
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:36,572
Right. Any questions?
好, 还有问题吗？

Yes, sir, this, um... police box. Is it important?
有, 长官．这个, 嗯... 警察亭, 它重要吗？

154
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:42,410
Corporal Blake, we'd hardly be going to this trouble if it weren't.
Blake 下士, 如果它不重要我们就不用费这个事了

155
00:35:43,158 --> 00:35:45,017
Who's going to look after the civilians, sir?
谁来照看这几个平民, 长官？

156
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:47,813
I'd like you to stay behind and look after them, Captain Knight.
我期望你留下来照看他们, Knight 队长

157
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:51,513
The Doctor's got work to do. Right gentlemen, time to go.
博士还有工作要完成．好了先生们, 该行动了

158
00:35:51,657 --> 00:35:52,935

- 啊，博士   - 哦，Jamie，什么事

The Colonel says to tell you he's on his way.

To rescue the TARDIS!

He's wasting his time.

163
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:00,751
Well that's what I told him. And I think that man Chorley must be behind...
我也是这么跟他说的。而且我觉得那个 Chorley 应该在背后...

164

Now look! Get behind me, both of you, and keep clear. Here we go...
来看！到我后面去，你俩都是，别乱动。开始了

00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:14,588
The tin's empty!... Evans!
铁盒是空的！... Evans！

当然，我真不该这么干，知道吗，Staff

169
00:36:19,023 --> 00:36:20,912
Not officially on the strength down here, see. /21.2

What I am really is a driver, you see...

Don't try to come the old soldier with me, lad!

Who, me?

Yes, you! And when we get in the tunnels, don't you try to skive off,
是，你！等我们进了隧道，你别想溜走

队长，他们不见了，我估计 Evans 也跟他们在一起。我哪儿也找不到他

这就奇怪了，博士，真菌不见了

No, not of the right type.

那这种情况下，博士，我就帮不了你了

你觉得他们会将警察亭送到这里来吗, Staff?

唔 - 就看我们能否把这个东西穿过真菌网了

志愿者？ 这词真不好听．我可不干！

202
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:05,510

00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:06,613
What for, Staff?
做什么, Staff?

这样, 如果这个东西需要点帮助才能穿过去到达科文特花园, 我就得自己来...
