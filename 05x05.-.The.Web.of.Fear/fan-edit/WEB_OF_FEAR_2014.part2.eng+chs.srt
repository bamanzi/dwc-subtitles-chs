What do you mean?
你什么意思？

you've encountered the Yeti, you've also come across the Doctor?
你就从来没有觉得奇怪, 你两次遇到雪怪, 你都碰到了博士？

89
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:51,981

Evans? Anybody know him?

00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:28,142
Oh, I'm not one of your lot, sir.

Trying to get out, Sarge!
在找路出去, 中士!

How did you get down here in the first place?
别想跟我开玩笑, 小伙子！你一开始是怎么来这里的？

182
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:40,144
Driver on the ammo truck to Holborn. Got jumped, we did - quite a dust up, there was. /40

183
00:25:40,462 --> 00:25:46,444
Couldn't get past them hairy creatures, see? Been wandering for hours. Lost, I was. /46

184
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:50,644
I tried one way, but there seemed to be some sort of cobweb muck moving down the tunnel.

185
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:52,688
Moving? Are you sure it was moving?
在移动？你确定它是在移动？

我当然确定，长官。听起来有点傻，我知道

but it seemed to be following a Yeti that had a kind of pointed glass thing in its hands.
但它似乎是跟一个雪怪在移动, 雪怪手里有一种玻璃状的尖头器件

Well, I suppose it was, really.
