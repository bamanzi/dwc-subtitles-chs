1
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,184
What are we going to do now, Staff?

2
00:57:17,315 --> 00:57:23,452
The main door should keep the fungus out of the tunnels for a bit. We must warn the others that HQ's had it.

3
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:24,171
Right.

4
00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:25,210
Well, come on, then.

5
00:57:25,422 --> 00:57:26,528
Oh, oh no, not me.

6
00:57:26,846 --> 00:57:28,751
You're not disobeying an order, are you, Evans?

7
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,475
Now look here, Staff. If we go up there, and this stuff breaks out, we'll be trapped!

8
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:42,996
Now look, lad, you're scared, that's understandable.
But you've been in the Army long enough to know that orders is orders.
There's four people up there. If we don't warn them, they're for the chop.

9
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:47,405
So? Four of them's getting the chop - there's no reason to make it six, is there?

10
00:57:47,616 --> 00:57:50,550
I've had enough of your lip for one day. Now come on! Follow me.

11
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,371
Evans! Come back here!

12
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,780
Not on your nelly! Cheerio, Staff!

13
00:57:59,965 --> 00:58:02,698
Right, lad - I'll get you for this!

14
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:09,662
Anne...

15
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:11,732
Hey!

16
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:15,886
Stop! Come back here!

17
00:58:17,787 --> 00:58:26,223
Stop! Anne, I've been thinking. Until we know who else is working for the Intelligence, everyone must be suspect.

18
00:58:26,716 --> 00:58:27,341
Yes?

19
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,596
Well, the fewer people who know this chap's on our side, the better.

20
00:58:29,878 --> 00:58:34,441
Yes... yes, and whoever is the Intelligence is bound to know that you're controlling this Yeti.

21
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:36,957
Mmm... I know.

22
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:45,120
You are to remain here for... Do you think a minute will be enough?

23
00:58:45,364 --> 00:58:45,953
What for?

24
00:58:46,145 --> 00:58:47,051
For us to get clear.

25
00:58:47,269 --> 00:58:48,133
Perhaps.

26
00:58:48,373 --> 00:58:57,080
You are to remain here for ninety seconds, and then resume acting on orders from the Intelligence until you are told otherwise. Is that understood?

27
00:59:01,086 --> 00:59:05,923
Right. Switch off, for ninety seconds, starting from... now.

28
00:59:07,288 --> 00:59:08,197
Come on, Anne.

29
00:59:17,024 --> 00:59:18,218
It is them! Come on!

30
00:59:21,235 --> 00:59:24,093
Am I glad to see you! There's fungus at Warren Street.

31
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:24,904
Yes, I know.

32
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:26,671
Oh. What are you doing down here, anyway?

33
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,128
Well, as a matter of fact...

34
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:31,780
I'll tell you another time. Hello, Colonel.

35
00:59:34,857 --> 00:59:37,874
Glad to see you're both safe. Any luck with your gadgets?

36
00:59:38,153 --> 00:59:39,762
No. No, I'm afraid not.

37
00:59:40,052 --> 00:59:40,810
Pity.

38
00:59:41,084 --> 00:59:42,096
Any news of Victoria?

39
00:59:42,348 --> 00:59:43,816
Yes, she's at Piccadilly Station.

40
00:59:44,005 --> 00:59:44,626
Piccadilly?

41
00:59:44,836 --> 00:59:45,638
Is my father there too?

42
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:46,675
Aye, he's with her.

43
00:59:46,843 --> 00:59:47,506
Are they alright?

44
00:59:47,912 --> 00:59:48,161
Yes.

45
00:59:48,571 --> 00:59:49,447
How do you know?

46
00:59:49,645 --> 00:59:50,561
Ran across Arnold - he saw them.

47
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:51,537
Arnold?

48
00:59:51,932 --> 00:59:54,150
Arnold! But Evans said - the fungus...

49
00:59:54,473 --> 00:59:58,345
Yes, he went into it, alright, but he came out again somehow.
Says he can't remember what happened.

50
00:59:58,753 --> 01:00:00,180
Well we haven't got any time to find out.

51
01:00:00,414 --> 01:00:01,773
No, time's nearly up.

52
01:00:02,185 --> 01:00:03,462
Yes, your twenty minutes.

53
01:00:03,797 --> 01:00:05,442
Well come on, then.

54
01:00:07,715 --> 01:00:08,715
What are you going to do?

55
01:00:08,893 --> 01:00:16,172
We can't do anything until we get back to Headquarters,
and... then, if we've got time, we'll try and increase the range of the control units. Come on!

56
01:00:43,313 --> 01:00:44,341
What is it, Colonel?

57
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:45,688
Something up ahead.

58
01:00:45,954 --> 01:00:47,152
We can't go back!

59
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,813
What, fungus, you mean?

60
01:00:49,003 --> 01:00:49,498
Yes.

61
01:00:49,709 --> 01:00:51,055
Is that you, Colonel?

62
01:00:51,308 --> 01:00:53,534
It's Arnold. Hang on, Staff!

63
01:00:53,707 --> 01:00:55,116
Why isn't he in HQ?

64
01:00:57,084 --> 01:01:00,407
Sir - the fungus. It's swamped HQ.

65
01:01:00,602 --> 01:01:01,266
No!

66
01:01:01,466 --> 01:01:05,438
I'm afraid so, sir. The main doors should keep it out of the tunnels for a bit, but...

67
01:01:05,902 --> 01:01:06,715
Where's Evans?

68
01:01:07,192 --> 01:01:08,091
Scarpered, sir.

69
01:01:18,324 --> 01:01:21,812
Our time's up! We're all together - they've come to fetch us!

70
01:01:49,815 --> 01:01:57,546
H... hello! If you... if you're looking for your friend, he went that way...

71
01:01:59,384 --> 01:02:09,690
Look, you don't want me!... I'm not one of them, see?...
Driver, that's what I am... shouldn't be down here at all, really...

72
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:11,119
Hey, steady on!

73
01:02:12,504 --> 01:02:15,593
Oh, going for a walk, are we? There's lovely.

74
01:02:37,264 --> 01:02:39,051
I'm going to make a break for it, sir.

75
01:02:39,731 --> 01:02:40,672
Think you can?

76
01:02:41,066 --> 01:02:46,968
Well, it's worth a try. On the loose, sir, I might be able to do something. If only you could distract them, sir.

77
01:02:47,725 --> 01:02:48,680
Right, Staff.

78
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:55,057
I think it wants us to go on, sir.

79
01:02:55,812 --> 01:02:57,435
Right. Here we go.

80
01:03:03,494 --> 01:03:06,745
Wait!... Can't you see, he's fallen over!

81
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:11,253
Be careful, be careful!

82
01:03:20,234 --> 01:03:22,136
Where are we being taken, Professor?

83
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,870
Oh, to meet the Intelligence, I suppose.

84
01:03:30,803 --> 01:03:31,971
A pyramid!

85
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:42,977
Yes - but it's different! We... we've never seen one like this before. It's fascinating!
This must be the machine that the Intelligence intends using on the Doctor.

86
01:03:44,225 --> 01:03:46,643
Oh, no no. No, I shouldn't if I was you.

87
01:03:46,863 --> 01:03:48,134
Yes, I think perhaps you're right.

88
01:03:53,203 --> 01:03:55,377
Why didn't you tell me all this before?

89
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:56,691
Him.

90
01:03:56,926 --> 01:03:58,098
You don't think the Colonel...

91
01:03:58,290 --> 01:03:59,466
Well, you never know, do you?

92
01:04:01,852 --> 01:04:03,394
Which one is ours?

93
01:04:04,068 --> 01:04:05,665
I don't know.

94
01:04:06,002 --> 01:04:06,595
What!

95
01:04:06,878 --> 01:04:08,768
Well unfortunately I've lost track of him.

96
01:04:09,077 --> 01:04:10,415
Oh, that's a great help!

97
01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:18,004
Well, never mind, I... I want you to take this microphone and keep on calling our Yeti to you.

98
01:04:18,802 --> 01:04:20,615
How will I know I've got the right one?

99
01:04:21,283 --> 01:04:27,922
Well, you'll soon know if you haven't got the right one, won't you!
Jamie, I hope you don't suffer from claustrophobia!

100
01:04:35,752 --> 01:04:44,091
Sergeant! Oh, oh thank heavens I found you! I've been wondering down here by myself for... for ages!

101
01:04:44,477 --> 01:04:48,279
Well well well, quite forgotten about you, we had, Mr Chorley!

102
01:04:48,803 --> 01:05:02,506
Tried to get out over the surface, but... there were Yeti everywhere!
And there's this... this fungus, and fog, all around, you see, and... it's hopeless!

103
01:05:07,352 --> 01:05:09,031
Where's the control box?

104
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:11,066
Hm?

105
01:05:11,766 --> 01:05:12,993
The control box!

106
01:05:13,644 --> 01:05:14,680
It's in my pocket.

107
01:05:15,089 --> 01:05:19,077
Well, why don't you use it on these Yeti? And then maybe we can escape!

108
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:22,734
Oh, no. I must meet the Intelligence face to face.

109
01:05:23,313 --> 01:05:24,208
Doctor?

110
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:25,380
What is it?

111
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:31,198
Been thinking - the Yeti haven't noticed McCrimmon's disappearance yet.
 Not that I think he'll be able to achieve anything.

112
01:05:31,445 --> 01:05:32,261
Go on...

113
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:37,942
Well, I don't really know how to say this, but, um... there's Miss Travers and Victoria to think of, and, er...

114
01:05:38,247 --> 01:05:40,775
You mean, am I going to give myself up?

115
01:05:41,379 --> 01:05:48,276
Yes. Of course, the decision must be yours, and yours alone. But the Intelligence did promise to release Travers and Victoria.

116
01:05:48,816 --> 01:05:50,192
You believe that?

117
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:51,856
Well, why not?

118
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:54,665
Hello, we've got company.

119
01:05:58,868 --> 01:06:00,050
Hello, sir!

120
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:02,525
Evans, where the devil have you been?

121
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,430
Didn't Staff Arnold tell you, sir?

122
01:06:04,806 --> 01:06:07,475
Yes. Sounded very like desertion to me.

123
01:06:07,747 --> 01:06:17,074
Desertion? Me? Oh, good heavens, no!
No, I... I thought I'd try a single-handed and desperate attempt to rescue Professor Travers and the girl!

124
01:06:18,643 --> 01:06:20,542
Isn't Staff Arnold about?

125
01:06:20,878 --> 01:06:21,643
No.

126
01:06:21,892 --> 01:06:22,590
Good!

127
01:06:23,755 --> 01:06:24,981
Listen!...

128
01:06:25,499 --> 01:06:32,411
Now listen, everyone - when the Yeti come for you, don't struggle. Whatever you do, don't resist them!

129
01:06:33,591 --> 01:06:36,706
Don't struggle, he says! He must be joking!

130
01:06:37,472 --> 01:06:39,985
The Doctor will have to give in. There's no other choice!

131
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:43,758
Aye, aye, time to get fell in!

132
01:07:24,488 --> 01:07:25,571
Thank you!

133
01:07:41,651 --> 01:07:45,232
Father! Oh, father, are you alright?

134
01:07:45,439 --> 01:07:47,014
Yes, I'm alright again... Don't, don't worry, Anne.

135
01:07:47,212 --> 01:07:49,730
Jamie and the Doctor - where are they?

136
01:07:51,398 --> 01:07:52,174
Anne?

137
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:04,048
Come towards me... Like that, that's it... Come to...

138
01:08:09,928 --> 01:08:12,797
Right now. Raise your right arm.

139
01:08:17,387 --> 01:08:19,834
Raise your right arm!

140
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,176
Oh, what's the use?

141
01:08:31,249 --> 01:08:35,058
Well, there's nothing to be afraid of, dear. Just - just be calm.

142
01:08:37,804 --> 01:08:38,541
Doctor!

143
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:39,553
The Doctor!

144
01:08:39,772 --> 01:08:40,329
Doctor!

145
01:08:40,727 --> 01:08:41,705
What are they going to do?

146
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:43,317
Now don't worry, Victoria.

147
01:08:43,526 --> 01:08:44,205
But... I...

148
01:08:44,414 --> 01:08:46,261
Everything's under control. Don't be frightened.

149
01:08:46,578 --> 01:08:47,977
But Doctor, what are they going to do?

150
01:08:48,162 --> 01:08:51,044
Everything is under control. Tell her, Anne, you understand?

151
01:08:51,067 --> 01:08:52,003
Yes... yes, I think so.

152
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:57,834
Now listen, everyone. Don't do anything foolish! I am perfectly alright.

153
01:08:58,071 --> 01:09:06,973
Yes, he is perfectly alright. Thank you, Doctor, for being so cooperative.

154
01:09:07,613 --> 01:09:10,611
Why don't you show yourself? Who are you?

155
01:09:11,952 --> 01:09:17,118
Silence! You will know soon enough.

156
01:09:18,304 --> 01:09:18,864
Chorley!

157
01:09:19,095 --> 01:09:19,608
Good grief!

158
01:09:19,818 --> 01:09:20,404
But that horrible little man...

159
01:09:20,604 --> 01:09:21,282
You, the Intelligence?

160
01:09:21,484 --> 01:09:22,328
No... no!

161
01:09:22,515 --> 01:09:24,721
No no no, he can't be the Intelligence, he can't! It doesn't make sense!

162
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:32,005
It isn't me! It isn't me, don't you understand!
I'm not the Intelligence! The Intelligence is him!

163
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:34,530
It can't be!

164
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:38,870
Oh. Arnold

165
01:09:39,163 --> 01:09:53,015
No. Merely Arnold's lifeless body in which I have concealed myself.
But let us to work. There will be time for discussion later. In fact, all the time in the world.

166
01:09:53,998 --> 01:09:57,435
Oh... so you weren't going to let us go then, afterwards?

167
01:09:57,667 --> 01:09:58,714
Did you think he would?

168
01:09:58,984 --> 01:10:02,471
The last member of the party. Come and join us!

169
01:10:07,414 --> 01:10:08,563
Oh, Jamie!

170
01:10:08,745 --> 01:10:10,206
Victoria, are you alright?

171
01:10:10,435 --> 01:10:14,767
Your solicitude is touching. Nevertheless, it is wasting time.

172
01:10:14,979 --> 01:10:16,995
Frightened that something might go wrong?

173
01:10:18,713 --> 01:10:19,839
Join the Doctor.

174
01:10:21,746 --> 01:10:23,291
Do what he says, Jamie.

175
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:30,439
Take him!

176
01:10:30,677 --> 01:10:31,820
Leave him! Leave him be!

177
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:40,896
I must ensure your complete cooperation, Doctor. Should you prove at all unhelpful, your young friend's neck will be broken.

178
01:10:41,094 --> 01:10:46,458
You gave your word that no one would be harmed. I refuse to submit until you release Jamie!

179
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:49,097
Alright. Release the boy!

180
01:10:50,032 --> 01:10:52,924
But at the first sign of trouble from you...

181
01:10:53,101 --> 01:10:56,030
Don't worry. I will do what you say.

182
01:10:56,699 --> 01:11:00,981
Good. Into the machine, Doctor.

183
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:52,766
Soon your mind will be absorbed by the Great Intelligence. You should be very proud, Doctor - your knowledge of the past will help to shape the future of this planet.

184
01:11:53,068 --> 01:11:54,211
Just get on with it, please.

185
01:11:54,415 --> 01:11:57,311
You seem very anxious suddenly.

186
01:11:58,211 --> 01:11:59,845
I just want it over and done with.

187
01:12:01,949 --> 01:12:27,735
Submission is essential. You must understand, Doctor, that without your complete cooperation,
this transference would be of no value. Should you offer any opposition, either physical or mental, I shall be forced to punish you, or rather your friends.
Prepare for a great darkness to cloud your mind.

188
01:12:28,028 --> 01:12:29,211
Attack now! Attack the Yeti!

189
01:12:29,416 --> 01:12:30,595
Stop it! Stop it!

190
01:12:32,818 --> 01:12:33,753
Get Arnold!

191
01:12:34,598 --> 01:12:36,502
No, Jamie, no!

192
01:12:37,307 --> 01:12:38,456
Come on, get the Doctor out!

193
01:12:46,411 --> 01:12:49,723
No, you don't understand, you'll ruin everything! No!

194
01:12:49,972 --> 01:12:51,752
Professor! Anne! Give us some help!

195
01:12:53,268 --> 01:13:01,390
No! No!... No! Leave me be! You don't understand, I've got to stay here!

196
01:13:34,573 --> 01:13:36,810
Well, that's that then, innit?

197
01:13:37,011 --> 01:13:40,687
You blithering Welsh imbecile! Why can't you do what you're told?

198
01:13:41,093 --> 01:13:44,555
Hey, now just a minute, Doctor! If we hadn't pulled you out of that, you'd have been a heap of dust by now.

199
01:13:44,621 --> 01:13:48,273
You're just as bad. I told you to leave it to me! Now you've gone and ruined everything!

200
01:13:48,495 --> 01:13:51,035
Ruined every - How can we! We... we've won, haven't we?

201
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:51,730
No!

202
01:13:51,967 --> 01:13:52,883
What do you mean, Doctor?

203
01:13:53,052 --> 01:14:06,205
Oh, why didn't they leave it to me? I had crossed those wires on that helmet thing. The Intelligence wouldn't have drained me, I had... would have drained the Intelligence! As it is, all it got was a crossed circuit!

204
01:14:06,392 --> 01:14:11,834
You mean, all we've done is... is cut off its contact with Earth, it's - it's still out there in space somewhere, flying around?

205
01:14:12,045 --> 01:14:13,680
Precisely! Look!

206
01:14:17,852 --> 01:14:18,651
Oh!

207
01:14:19,012 --> 01:14:20,498
Oh, poor fellow!

208
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,455
Do you mean to say that Arnold wasn't the Intelligence?

209
01:14:23,732 --> 01:14:29,772
No. He was just a poor soldier that was taken over. He was probably one of the first to disappear.

210
01:14:30,952 --> 01:14:32,565
You mean it might come back?

211
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:37,167
Well, it's still around, isn't it? I've failed.

212
01:14:37,403 --> 01:14:38,567
Nonsense, man!

213
01:14:38,754 --> 01:14:39,885
You were marvellous.

214
01:14:40,087 --> 01:14:41,040
Yes. Great victory.

215
01:14:41,233 --> 01:14:41,987
I doubt it.

216
01:14:42,181 --> 01:14:45,243
No - you were a hero, and you know it.

217
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:47,180
You don't really think so. Do you?

218
01:14:47,335 --> 01:14:48,127
Yes, yes I do.

219
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:52,551
You've got to face facts, old man. Tomorrow you're going to be a household word, a national figure...

220
01:14:52,584 --> 01:14:53,355
Oh no, oh no!

221
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:55,314
Yeah! I want you on my television programme, and...

222
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:57,147
Jamie! Victoria! Come along, it's time we left!

223
01:14:57,346 --> 01:14:58,275
...but the Press Conference, Doctor!

224
01:14:58,495 --> 01:14:59,103
Goodbye!

225
01:14:59,339 --> 01:15:02,727
But Doctor, Doctor, you... you can't go yet, there are a lot of things I want to discuss with you!

226
01:15:02,896 --> 01:15:04,269
I'm sorry, Travers, we have to go.

227
01:15:04,468 --> 01:15:05,437
Where are you going?

228
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:08,050
Covent Garden! Come along. Come along, Jamie.

229
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:10,864
Bye!... Bye.

230
01:15:13,147 --> 01:15:14,136
Where's he going?

231
01:15:14,887 --> 01:15:17,714
Huh? Oh, er, back to his TARDIS, I suppose.

232
01:15:17,765 --> 01:15:21,112
You mean this, uh, this time machine thing, it really exists?

233
01:15:21,728 --> 01:15:27,625
Y... well I, er... oh, explain it to him, Anne, will you?

234
01:15:27,897 --> 01:15:30,019
Colonel, I think we'd better check up top, don't you?

235
01:15:30,188 --> 01:15:32,072
Right, Professor. Evans!

236
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:33,827
Father - father, I...

237
01:15:34,033 --> 01:15:39,872
Now don't you go, Miss Travers, I'd er, I'd like you to explain all about this, this time machine for me.

238
01:15:40,242 --> 01:15:42,129
Oh dear...!

239
01:15:43,791 --> 01:15:46,447
Well, where do we go? Which is the way to Covent Garden?

240
01:15:46,721 --> 01:15:49,412
Oh, don't ask me. I've completely lost my bearings.

241
01:15:49,704 --> 01:15:51,734
All these tunnels look the same to me.

242
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:53,271
Come on, let's try this way.

243
01:15:53,511 --> 01:15:55,471
Well it doesn't matter, anyway. I mean, there's no danger, is there?

244
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:59,383
Well, not from the Yeti, no, but who knows, they might suddenly start the trains again! Come on!

245
01:15:59,667 --> 01:16:00,204
Trains?

246
01:16:00,402 --> 01:16:00,852
Oh!

247
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:01,635
Come on!

248
02:00:53,014 --> 02:00:53,948
There's someone there...

249
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:54,703
What?

250
02:00:54,912 --> 02:00:55,538
There!

251
02:00:55,736 --> 02:00:59,650
Who's that? Who is it? D'you see who it was?

252
02:00:59,871 --> 02:01:02,283
No. Do you think it could have been...

253
02:01:02,515 --> 02:01:07,868
The Intelligence? If only we could do something!

254
02:01:08,443 --> 02:01:10,799
I'm sure the Doctor will think of something.

255
02:01:11,054 --> 02:01:16,053
No, not this time, Victoria. The Doctor would never risk the chance of the Intelligence harming you.

256
02:01:16,957 --> 02:01:18,644
You mean he'll just give in?

257
02:01:20,123 --> 02:01:24,031
Yes, I'm afraid so. Afraid there's no alternative.

258
02:01:24,273 --> 02:02:00,875
Yes, you're right, Professor. He has no alternative. I am sorry not to be here to welcome you personally, but I am sure you will not be offended. After all, the guest of honour is the Doctor - he, I am sure, will cooperate, as I advise you to do. Any attempt to interfere would be pointless. My Yeti can destroy you so easily.

259
02:02:04,441 --> 02:02:14,857
It's all my fault! If I hadn't tampered with that sphere - people killed, London invaded, all because of my wretched curiosity!

260
02:02:15,155 --> 02:02:16,738
Don't blame yourself, Professor.

261
02:02:16,952 --> 02:02:21,587
Why not? I... I've sacrificed you all! And for what?

262
02:06:04,345 --> 02:06:06,650
My, my, my, we are in a state, aren't we, sir?

263
02:06:10,449 --> 02:06:16,973
Yes... alright... no, I'm fine. I've just been so scared, that's all!

264
02:06:17,181 --> 02:06:19,029
'S alright, sir, nothing to be ashamed of.

265
02:06:19,529 --> 02:06:20,285
Yes.

266
02:06:21,810 --> 02:06:24,678
There's just one thing that puzzles me though, sir.

267
02:06:25,038 --> 02:06:27,728
Oh, what's that?

268
02:06:28,389 --> 02:06:31,877
How you managed to exist all this time - why didn't the Yetis get you?

269
02:06:35,724 --> 02:06:38,027
I'm sorry, what are you suggesting? You're not suggesting that I...

270
02:06:38,309 --> 02:06:44,339
Oh no, sir, I was just wondering, that's all. I think perhaps you'd better come along with me, don't you, sir? Come on, now.
