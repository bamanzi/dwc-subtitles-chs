消灭 消灭
Exterminate  Exterminate 

147
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:32,422
- 有枪声  - 快点儿 我们应该离开这里
- That was gunfire. 
- Quickly! We should get out here.

148
00:13:32,587 --> 00:13:34,384
快点儿 
Quickly!

149
00:13:42,707 --> 00:13:45,983
没什么好担心的 回去吧
There's nothing to worry about.

150

好了 炸药待发
Right, explosive charges primed.

151
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:04,843
那是什么味儿
What is that smell?

152
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:15,877
- 向后退 - 救救我
- Keep back. - Help me!

153
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:17,480
离我远点儿 
Stay away!

154
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:19,683
我怎么了 
What's happening to me?

155
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:40,960
不 
No!

156
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:52,366
解除武装
Disarmed.

157
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:56,240
释放Davros
Release Davros.

158
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,146
那不是Archer上校
That's not Colonel Archer.

159
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:15,664
他把他的枪和腰带给了博士 但是这个还戴着
He gave the Doctor his gun belt,
yet he's wearing one.

160
00:15:17,456 --> 00:15:18,965
你们俩在说什么悄悄话呢
What are you two whispering about? 

161
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:21,865
我在想Tegen的救护车什么时候来
I was wondering when will
the ambulance for Tegen would arrive?

162
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:25,045
- 一会儿就到  - 增援人员呢
- That is in hand.  - The reinforcements?

163
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:28,883
这是军事问题，所以得保密
That is a military matter 
and therefore confidential.

164
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:31,686
我想我们不应该再等救护车了
I don't think we should
wait for the ambulance.

165
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:34,526
仓库处于军事管制中
This warehouse is under martial law.

166
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:37,321
试图离开会被枪决
Attempt to leave and I'll have you shot.

167
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:42,504
我在那里冻了九十年
Ninety years I was frozen in that.

168
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:46,455
九十年的 心烦意乱
Ninety years of mind-numbing boredom.

169
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:49,903
- 那时候你有意识吗  - 每一秒都有
- You were conscious?  - Every second.

170
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:53,696
地球上的那些生物 没兴趣对人执行死刑
The creatures of Earth have no
stomach for judicial murder.

171
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:57,741
他们更喜欢让你 慢慢腐烂直到死去
They prefer to leave you to slowly rot and die.

172
00:15:58,947 --> 00:16:01,415
这就是他们所谓的人道主义
They call it being humane.

173
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,017
那你也以其人之道还治其人之身
Then you must be equally humane in your revenge.

174
00:16:05,227 --> 00:16:09,698
那是一个我应该毁灭的星球 被我优哉游哉地毁灭
It is a planet I shall destroy at my leisure.

175
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:13,701
但是首先 我必须要对付一个爱管闲事的时间领主
But first, I must deal with a meddling Time Lord.

176
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:16,859
- 这我们预料到了  - 你抓到了博士
- That's been anticipated. 
- You have the Doctor?

177
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:19,262
分分钟的事儿
His capture is imminent.

178
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:23,282
就是它了 我已经锁定了Dalek的飞船
That's it. I've located the Dalek ship.

179
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:25,777
等到了仓库我接到Tegan就放你下去
I'll drop you off at the warehouse 
when I collect Tegan.

180
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:28,177
- 我跟你一起去 - 你真好人
- I'll come with you. - Good man.

181
00:16:32,027 --> 00:16:36,418
博士的Tardis 已经被带到时光走廊里了
The Doctor's Tardis has been 
caught in the Time Corridor.

182
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:40,785
- 准备复制车间 - 遵命
- Prepare the duplication room. - I obey.

183
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:53,138
Turlough
Turlough?

184
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,538
Turlough
Turlough?

185
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:02,905
傻孩子...嘘!
Foolish boy...Shh!

186
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:06,826
快点儿! 我们离开这里吧
Quickly! Let's get out of here.

187
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:08,828
不, 博士
No, Doctor.

188
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:12,908
真是疯了
This is madness.

189
00:17:13,077 --> 00:17:16,547
Dalek不会因为感谢你抓住了我 它们会杀了你
The Daleks won't thank you
for capturing me. They'll kill you.

190
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:18,708
我没有完全说实话
I didn't quite tell the truth.

191
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:22,153
我服务于Dalek 我是它们的特工
I serve the Daleks. I'm a Dalek agent.

192
00:17:22,547 --> 00:17:28,417
消灭博士 消灭博士
Exterminate the Doctor!
Exterminate the Doctor!

193
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,544
- 消... - 等等
- Exterm... - Wait!

194
00:17:30,707 --> 00:17:34,939
他是Dalek的敌人 他必须被消灭
He is an enemy of the Daleks. 
He must be exterminated.

195
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:37,581
他必须先被复制
He must be duplicated first.

196
00:17:38,147 --> 00:17:40,581
请跟Dalek元首联系
Confirm with the Supreme Dalek.

197
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:54,420
Dalek元首确认了这项命令
Supreme Dalek confirms the order.

198
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:57,818
我们必须把俘虏 送到复制室
We must take the prisoner to the duplication chamber.

199
00:17:57,987 --> 00:17:59,943
向前走
Proceed.

200
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:10,384
- 他们很冲动 不是吗 - 他们会杀了任何人
- Impulsive, aren't they?
- They'd kill anybody,

201
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,438
就算他们需要他
even if they need them.

202
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:14,975
什么时候轮到你呢
How long before it's your turn

203
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:19,628
蹲下!
Down!

204
00:18:25,517 --> 00:18:27,508
开火!
Fire!

205
00:18:36,757 --> 00:18:38,748
小心点儿.
Careful.

206
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,948
穿上他们的制服!
Uniforms!

207
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,868
穿上他们的制服
Uniforms.

208
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:54,507
我们应该马上离开这儿
We should leave here at once.

209
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:58,107
没Davros,我们没有未来
Without Davros, we have no future.

210
00:18:58,277 --> 00:19:02,190
我们一定要让他相信 我们服务于他
He must be made to believe that we serve him.

211
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:05,967
Dalek和Movellan陷入了僵局
The Daleks and the Movellans
were locked in an impasse.

212
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:08,446
每次他们各自的舰队试图施行一个策略,
Each time their respective fleets 
attempted a stratagem,

213
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:13,054
都会被对方的战争电脑立即识破和进行反击
it was instantly anticipated and countered
by their opponent's battle computer.

214
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,907
后来 Movellan 找到了制胜先机
Then the Movellans found the answer.

215
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:17,468
对不起, 先生
Sorry, sir.

216
00:19:17,517 --> 00:19:19,633
快点, 告诉我
Quickly, tell me.

217
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:23,631
他们发明了一种专门对付Dalek的病毒
They developed a virus which exclusively attacks the Daleks.

218
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:26,206
整个舰队都被摧毁了 幸存的都逃走到了宇宙的各个地方
The fleet was destroyed. Those who survived
went to separate parts of the Universe

219
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:30,556
为了避免进一步感染，也为了寻找治愈方法
to avoid the risk of further
infection and to work on a cure.

220
00:19:30,757 --> 00:19:33,988
- 找到了吗  - 还没有
- Have they succeeded?  - Not yet.

221
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:36,358
你们要拿要我的复制品干什么
What would do you with my duplicate?

222
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:41,203
- 那与你无关  - 我觉得有关我可相当喜欢自己
- That does not concern you. 
- Oh, I think it does. I'm rather attached to myself.

223
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,185
你要保持沉默
You will remain silent.

224
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:47,407
我猜我的脑电波会被传送给Davros
I assume my brain waves are destined for Davros.

225
00:19:47,527 --> 00:19:49,483
你们一定十分需要他
You must need his services very badly.

226
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:54,397
Dalek是高等种族 我们不需要帮助
Daleks are the superior being.
We do not require assistance.

227
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:59,277
高等 你花了一辈子时间把Tardis引入时间走廊吧
Superior? It took you long enough
to ensure the Tardis in the Time Corridor.

228
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:03,565
- 只是一个陷阱 - 嗯 Stien看起来更有效率
- It was but one trap.
- Hm. Stien was more effective.

229
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:06,060
一个活生生有思想的人 而不是一部铁锅机器
A living, thinking being, not some tin-pot machine.

230
00:20:06,347 --> 00:20:11,960
- 别说了 博士  - Stien只是Dalek技术的一个延伸
- Please, Doctor!
- Stien is but an extension of Dalek technology.

231
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,885
- 什么 - 他是个复制品
- What? - He is a duplicate.

232
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:19,244
他是 我们基因工程的产物
He is a product of our genetic engineering.

233
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:24,359
- 你们所有人都是复制品吗 - 是的
- Are you all duplicates? - Yes.

234
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:28,800
真有意思 我想知道你们本人身上发生了些什么
Interesting. I wonder what happened to the real you.

235
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:33,896
这很重要 你早点完成你的研究
It is vital you complete
your researches as soon as possible.

236
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:39,377
- 我需要Movellan病毒的样本 - 等一下会拿给你
- I need a sample of the Movellan virus.
- It will be brought to you.

237
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:42,585
我还需要两个Dalek
I will also need two Daleks

238
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:44,305
来做实验
for experimentation.

239
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:46,304
那不行
That is forbidden.

240
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:50,898
如果要我找到解药 我需要活体Dalek组织
If I am to find a cure, 
I will need living Dalek tissue.

241
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:56,137
- 我们必须要问过Dalek元首 - 那就去问 快点
- We must consult the Supreme Dalek. 
- Do so! But be quick!

242
00:20:56,307 --> 00:21:00,346
自毁系统控制室 被入侵了
The self-destruct chamber has been invaded.

243
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:03,579
敌人必须被消灭
The hostiles must be exterminated.

244
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:06,545
没时间了 放弃空间站
There isn't time. Abandon the space station.

245
00:21:06,707 --> 00:21:09,460
你应该预料到这个
You should have anticipated this.

246
00:21:09,627 --> 00:21:13,666
最初的计划是救出Davros然后离开 而不是跟着他的兴致跳舞
The original plan was to snatch Davros and leave, not dance to his every whim

247
00:21:13,827 --> 00:21:17,217
不能让Davros有任何危险
Nothing must endanger Davros.

248
00:21:17,387 --> 00:21:23,940
敌人必须被毁掉 必须要服从Dalek
The hostiles must be destroyed.
The Daleks must be obeyed!

249

外面  关上门  Dalek军队来了 
That's outside! Close the door! Dalek troopers!

250
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:42,441
他们肯定看到我们了 端掉那个摄像头

设个障碍物 可以用来保护我们

00:21:47,727 --> 00:21:51,486
- 仓库的士兵们已经被复制了吗 - 是的

been duplicated?  - Yes.

253
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:53,683
真聪明 告诉我是怎么搞定的
It's very clever. Would you care to tell me how it's done.

254
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:55,838
- 不  - 我想你不会的
- No.  - Thought you wouldn't.

255
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,325
Tegan怎么办
What about Tegan?

256
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:03,443
- 她是我们的犯人 - 她不会害人 你们必须放了她

258
00:22:20,487 --> 00:22:23,047
- 为什么 - 没有同伴的博士

259
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:26,677
- 看起来一无是处 - 你为什么要这样做
- would be rather incongruous.
- Why are you doing this?

260
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,998
你的复制品会回到Gallifrey
Your duplicates will return to Gallifrey.

261
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:35,719
在我们的控制下 你要去刺杀 高等议会的成员
At our command, you will assassinate
the members of the High Council.

262

00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:45,898
我们是被  Dalek元首派来的
We have been sent by the Supreme Dalek.

264
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,945
我们要帮你完成试验
We are to assist in your research.

265
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:54,744
- 我需要的是Dalek组织,不是帮助 - 你可以从我们身上提取组织
- I need Dalek tissue, not help.
- You may remove tissue from us.

266
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:56,825
很好
Excellent.

267
00:22:57,987 --> 00:23:01,821
我的实验绝不会有害
In no way will my experiment harm.

268

你们服从谁

非常好
Excellent.

现在我需要的是Movellan病毒的样本
Now all I require is a sample of the Movellan virus.

could c-cloud my mind at any time.

去, 把病毒释放到Dalek飞船上
