我提到过的时间走廊 它是存在的 它是真实的 我们可以利用它逃生
The Time Corridor I mentioned. It exists. It's real. We could use it to escape.

141
01:08:25,107 --> 01:08:28,861
- 你觉得怎么样  - 你可以去看看
- What do you think? - You could check it out

142
01:08:29,027 --> 01:08:32,178
在我试着启动这东西的时候
while I try and find a way into this thing.

143
01:08:32,347 --> 01:08:33,666
好的
Right.

144
01:08:33,907 --> 01:08:36,899
你必须合作 必须躺下
You must co-operate. You must lie down.

145
01:08:39,547 --> 01:08:42,698
Davros怎么不在这儿  他应该想看到这一切
Why isn't Davros here? He'd want to see this.

146
01:08:42,867 --> 01:08:45,825
- 他停留在别处 - 这么说来他确实在这儿
- He is otherwise detained. - So he IS here.

147
01:08:49,227 --> 01:08:50,899
这和你无关

-不错 -但是它能骗过他们吗 
-Not bad. -But would it convince?

151
01:09:06,987 --> 01:09:10,502
如果你看起来不是很生硬...也许可以
If you didn't look too hard... Perhaps.

152
01:09:12,707 --> 01:09:15,540
事实是 你不得不装作看不见
The truth is, you'd have to be blind.

153
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:17,346
快点 
Quickly!

154
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:29,935
- 你们可以停止假装了 - 你说什么
- You can stop pretending. - What?

155
01:09:30,987 --> 01:09:34,184
- 你们将被送上Dalek的飞船 - Tegan很不舒服
- You will board the Dalek ship. - Tegan is sick.

156
01:09:34,347 --> 01:09:36,542
不用太久了
Not for much longer.

157
01:09:40,507 --> 01:09:42,623
无论如何 我们俩死定了
One way or another, we're both dead.

欢迎
Welcome!

162
01:10:07,707 --> 01:10:11,097
- 军队怎么办  - 杀了他们
- What about the troopers? - We kill them.

163
01:10:13,787 --> 01:10:18,303
Dalek呢 我们必须先设好自毁设备
And the Daleks? We must set the self-destruct device first.

164
01:10:15,347 --> 01:10:18,100
谢谢 Zena
Thanks a lot. Zena?

165
01:10:18,507 --> 01:10:20,179

01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:27,421
- Lt Mercer将进行安全检查 - 那很重要 给他接通无线电
- Lt Mercer will have security clearance. - That's a point. Get him on the radio.

168
01:10:27,587 --> 01:10:32,377
- Dalek能够追踪信号 - 试试高频范围
- The Daleks could trace the signal. - Try a high-frequency range.

169
01:10:28,387 --> 01:10:31,424
- 走吧 - 不 我留在这儿
- Let's go. - No. I should stay.

170
01:10:31,587 --> 01:10:34,943
- 他们会杀了你的 - 不会的 如果你找到了援兵
- They'll kill you. - Not if you get help quickly.

171
01:10:32,547 --> 01:10:34,936
Dalek无法监视所有的
The Daleks can't monitor them all.

172
01:10:35,107 --> 01:10:38,816
必须有人在这儿骗他们久一点
We need someone here to help the deception along.

173
01:10:38,987 --> 01:10:41,581
你是在浪费时间 走吧 快走 
You're wasting time. Go. Go!

174
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:51,059
- 祝你好运 - 你也一样 我会尽快的
- Good luck. - And you. I'll be as quick as I can.

175
01:10:51,707 --> 01:10:54,301
我们可以在墙上打个洞吗
Can we blow a hole in the wall?

176
01:10:59,467 --> 01:11:00,786
可以
Could.

177
01:11:01,627 --> 01:11:03,618
那我们就可以两面夹击了
Then we attack on two fronts.

178
01:11:22,187 --> 01:11:24,985
我的部队在持续增长
My army continues to grow.

179
01:11:38,187 --> 01:11:40,018

200
01:29:50,787 --> 01:29:55,144
真是疯了 Dalek不会因为你抓到我而感谢你的 他们会杀了你
This is madness. The Daleks won't thank you. They'll kill you.

201
01:29:56,467 --> 01:29:59,937
我没有完全讲实话 我服务于Dalek
I didn't quite tell you the truth. I serve the Daleks.

202
01:30:00,187 --> 01:30:02,098
我是它们的特工

不然他可以睡好几个小时
He'd have slept for hours.

217
01:35:06,347 --> 01:35:08,815
我们就可以从这儿出去了
We've got to get out of here.

218
01:35:10,587 --> 01:35:12,737
我们可以给这些重新接上线吗
Could we rewire these?

219
01:35:12,947 --> 01:35:15,177
我觉得可以
I should think so.

220
01:35:27,867 --> 01:35:29,266
朝前走
Proceed.

221
01:35:28,067 --> 01:35:30,820
- 你什么也做不了 - 我不该留下他们的
- There's nothing you can do. - I left them.

222
01:35:31,027 --> 01:35:34,144
你做的对 现在看你的了

223
01:35:34,307 --> 01:35:37,105
我们必须返回地球.

224
01:35:40,387 --> 01:35:42,742
- 他们知道了 - 我们怎么做

225
01:35:42,387 --> 01:35:43,979
相信我
Trust me!

226
01:35:43,867 --> 01:35:46,176
Dalek会通知我们
The Daleks will instruct us.

227
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,260
我们来的正是时候
Just in time.

228
01:35:54,467 --> 01:35:57,425
你的迟到给Dalek带来了风险
Your delay put the Dalek plan at risk.

229
01:35:57,627 --> 01:36:00,095
我们胜利了 这就够了
We won. That's all that matters.

230
01:36:00,267 --> 01:36:03,065
空间站 差点儿被摧毁
The space station could have been destroyed.

231
01:36:03,267 --> 01:36:06,464
我要向Dalek元首报告
I must report this to the Supreme Dalek.

232
01:36:13,867 --> 01:36:17,860
- 对不起 我尽力了 - 他们要把我们送到Dalek飞船上
- I'm sorry. I tried. - They're sending us to the Dalek ship.

233
01:36:15,707 --> 01:36:18,380
我已经很不耐烦了
Already I grow impatient.

234
01:36:23,587 --> 01:36:25,578
从哪里开始
Where do we start?

235
01:36:29,187 --> 01:36:30,506
Lytton
Lytton.

236
01:36:30,867 --> 01:36:33,540
Dalek元首在这儿
This is the Supreme Dalek.

237
01:55:59,467 --> 01:56:04,143
现在没啥好失去的了 我该对你们做些什么 
Now there's nothing to lose, what can I make of you?

238
01:57:48,907 --> 01:57:51,421
- 我们必须要做点儿什么 - 他们会杀了我们的
- We must do something. - They'll kill us.

239
01:57:51,587 --> 01:57:55,102
- 我必须要做点什么 - 想想
- I have to do something. - Think!

240
01:57:55,947 --> 01:57:57,983
Dalek有飞船,
The Daleks have a ship,

241
01:57:58,147 --> 01:58:02,140
为什么他们要闯进自毁系统控制室 为什么不离开
so why break into the self-destruct chamber? Why not leave?

242
01:58:02,347 --> 01:58:05,464
- 让你的朋友们炸掉他们 - 跟我说
- Let your friends blow themselves up. - Tell me.

243
01:58:06,347 --> 01:58:09,896
因为不管Dalek想要什么 那东西还在这里
Because whatever the Daleks want is still on board.

244
01:58:10,107 --> 01:58:11,586
Davros
Davros!

245
01:58:12,147 --> 01:58:15,901
你可能没办法帮你的朋友 但是你可以杀掉他
You may not be able to help your friends but you could kill HIM.

246
01:59:29,027 --> 01:59:31,825
找找延误的原因
Find out the cause of the delay.

247
02:00:02,507 --> 02:00:04,623
- 我们来晚了 - 他不可能离得很远
- Too late. - He can't be far.

248
02:00:04,787 --> 02:00:07,665
我们可能要花几个小时徒劳的搜寻
We could spend hours searching fruitlessly.

249
02:00:07,827 --> 02:00:10,785
这里满是Dalek
The place is crawling with Daleks.

250
02:00:10,947 --> 02:00:14,826
我必须要找到他... 你要跟我一起来
I have to find him... And you're coming with me.

251
02:00:34,947 --> 02:00:38,257
- 快准备好了 - 犯人有安保
- Nearly ready. - The prisoner is secured.

252
02:00:38,427 --> 02:00:43,342
你必须独自行动  我们被传唤去做其它事情
You must proceed alone. We have been summoned to other duties.

253
02:00:43,547 --> 02:00:47,665
- 不是待到最后 多让人失望呀 - 当你要死的时候,
- Not staying to the bitter end? - When it is time to die,

254
02:00:47,827 --> 02:00:52,821
你会非常痛苦的 要记得跪下来求Dalek
you will, in your agony, beg to pay homage to the Daleks.

255
02:00:54,827 --> 02:00:57,022
你在外面等着
You will wait outside.

256
02:01:07,587 --> 02:01:09,976
他们自视甚高
They take themselves so seriously.

257
02:01:10,187 --> 02:01:13,384
激怒他们只会让你处境更坏
Provoking them only makes it worse for you.

258
02:01:13,547 --> 02:01:17,017
动手吧 我不需要你的同情
Get on with it. I can do without your pity.

259
02:01:17,787 --> 02:01:23,305
你就认为我这样做是因为我喜... 我这样做是因为没有选...选...选择
Do you think I do this because I enj...? That I do this out of ch...ch...choice?

260
02:01:23,547 --> 02:01:26,061
我有...有...有选...选...选择吗
D...D...Do I have a ch...ch...choice?

261
02:01:28,387 --> 02:01:31,299
我没得选
I have no choice.

262
02:02:08,507 --> 02:02:11,385
Davros在用Styles的实验室
Davros is using Styles's laboratory.

263
02:02:17,827 --> 02:02:19,226
我们快做到了
We're nearly there!

264
02:02:20,867 --> 02:02:24,576
我为什么这么激动 这是我最不想做的
Why am I so excited? It's the last thing I'll ever do.

265
02:02:55,387 --> 02:02:57,776
丢了一个收集器
One of the cylinders disappeared!

266
02:03:03,067 --> 02:03:06,059
她去哪儿了 哪儿
Where is she? WHERE?

267
02:03:06,787 --> 02:03:08,220
她走不远的
She won't get far.

268
02:03:08,427 --> 02:03:09,906
啊
Aaaaagh!

269
02:03:37,947 --> 02:03:39,266
喂
Hey!

270
02:03:58,747 --> 02:04:00,066
不
No!

271
02:04:59,067 --> 02:05:01,786
- 他们正分头包抄我们的机械 - 我快弄好了
- They're bypassing the mechanism! - I'm almost there.

272
02:07:04,027 --> 02:07:06,495
你一定不要动这些设备
You must not touch the equipment.

273
02:07:07,627 --> 02:07:10,983
我没有死亡的威胁 你们显得好无力
Without the threat of death, you're quite powerless.

274
02:07:11,147 --> 02:07:12,978
服从
You will obey!

275
02:07:13,227 --> 02:07:18,824
- 激怒Dalek是很不明智的 博士 - 任何反应都会被视为挑衅
- It is unwise to provoke the Daleks Doctor - Any response is deemed provocative.

276
02:07:18,987 --> 02:07:24,186
我知道Dalek已经雄风不在了 还有Davros  我猜他已经是那样了
I know the Daleks of old. And Davros. I assume he's about.

277
02:07:24,387 --> 02:07:26,503
质疑只会引来麻烦
Questions only invite trouble.
