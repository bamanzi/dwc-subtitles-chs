他应该被毁灭

把他当作诱饵更好

64
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:28,783
这是军事秘密

65
00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:31,586
我想我们不应该再等救护车了
I don't think we'll wait for the ambulance.

66
00:15:31,787 --> 00:15:34,426
仓库处于军事管制中
This warehouse is under martial law.

67
00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:37,221
试图离开会被枪决
Attempt to leave and I'll have you shot.

我在那里冻了九十年

九十年的 心烦意乱
Ninety years of mind-numbing boredom.

70
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:49,803
- 那时候你有意识吗 - 每一秒都有

71
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:53,596
地球上的那些生物 没兴趣对人执行死刑

他们更喜欢让你 慢慢腐烂直到死去

73
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:01,315
这就是他们所谓的人道主义
They call it being humane.

74
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,917
那你也以其人之道还治其人之身
Then you must be equally humane in your revenge.

75
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:09,598
那是一个我应该毁灭的星球 被我好整以暇的毁灭
It is a planet I shall destroy at my leisure.

76
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:13,601
但是首先我必须要对付 一个爱管闲事的时间领主
But first, I must deal with a meddling Time Lord.

77
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,759
- 那是众望所归的 - 你抓到了博士
- That's been anticipated. - You have the Doctor?

78
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:19,162

就是它了 我已经锁定了Dalek的飞船

快点儿! 我们离开这里吧
Quickly! Let's get out of here.

88
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:08,728
不, 博士
No, Doctor.

89
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,808
真是疯了
This is madness.

90
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:16,447
Dalek不会因为你抓到我就感谢你的  它们会杀了你
The Daleks won't thank you for capturing me. They'll kill you.

91
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:18,608
我没有完全说实话
I didn't quite tell the truth.

92
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:22,053
我服务于Dalek 我们它们的特工
I serve the Daleks. I'm a Dalek agent.

93
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:19,528
卧倒!

00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,408
开火!
Fire!

95
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,648
小心点儿.
Careful.

96
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,848
穿上他们的制服!
Uniforms!

97
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:49,768
穿上他们的制服
Uniforms.

98
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,407
我们应该马上离开这儿
We should leave here at once.

99
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:58,007
没Davros,我们没有未来
Without Davros, we have no future.

100
00:18:58,177 --> 00:19:02,090
我们一定要让他相信 我们服务于他
He must be made to believe that we serve him.

101
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:05,867
Dalek和Movellan陷入了僵局
The Daleks and the Movellans were locked in an impasse.

102
00:19:06,037 --> 00:19:08,346
每次他们各自的舰队试图施行一个策略,
Each time their respective fleets attempted a stratagem,

103
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:12,954
都会被对方的战争电脑立即识破和进行反击

104
00:19:13,177 --> 00:19:14,807
后来 Movellan 找到了制胜先机
Then the Movellans found the answer.

105
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:17,368
对不起, 先生
Sorry, sir.

106
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:19,533
快点, 告诉我
Quickly, tell me.

107
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:23,531
他们发明了一种专门对付Dalek的病毒
They developed a virus which exclusively attacks the Daleks.

108
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:26,106
整个舰队都被摧毁了 幸存的都逃走到了宇宙的各个地方
The fleet was destroyed. Those who survived went to separate parts of the Universe

109
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:30,456
为了避免进一步感染，也为了寻找治愈方法
to avoid the risk of further infection and to work on a cure.

110
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:33,888
- 找到了吗 - 还没有

111
01:04:59,857 --> 01:05:03,372
我离不开我的冷冻室
I must remain close to my cryogenic chamber.

112
01:05:03,537 --> 01:05:05,528
我可能需要重新被冷冻
I may need to be re-frozen.

113
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:09,656
这儿有时间因素 空间站发送了一个遇险信号
There is a time factor. The space station transmitted a distress call.

114
01:05:09,817 --> 01:05:12,377
军队要花好几天时间 到达这里
It will take days for troops to arrive.

115
01:05:12,537 --> 01:05:15,529
如果信号被巡逻舰拦截就不会到达
Not if the signal's been intercepted by a patrol ship.

116
01:05:15,697 --> 01:05:20,725
那你把它射中吧 我动不了
Then you will shoot it down  I cannot be moved 

117

找个工程师来维修Davros
Order an engineer to attend Davros.

118
01:05:34,057 --> 01:05:40,087
所以...他们回到了 他们的创造者这里
So...they have returned to their creator.

119
01:05:40,257 --> 01:05:46,651
就像犯了错的孩子, 他们再一次回家了.
Like an errant child, they have come home once more.

120
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:51,971
不过这次, 他们不能再虐待我了

这次, 我将行使作为他们 君主的权利,

122
01:05:57,777 --> 01:06:04,012
在我的控制下Dalek 会再一次天下无敌

I cannot risk an accident. If the virus escaped on the Dalek ship...

可以逼Davros离开

01:07:50,737 --> 01:07:56,130
到那时候, 你必须供给他 所要求的一切
Until then, you must supply him with everything he demands.

146
01:07:56,297 --> 01:08:00,609
让他进入空间站 的实验室
Allow him access to the space station's laboratory.

147
01:07:57,817 --> 01:08:00,536
- Lytton司令 - 司令
- Commander Lytton. - Commander?

148
01:08:00,697 --> 01:08:06,010
- 我的Dalek不需要部队 - 没有我的话 你还在监狱里
- My Daleks do not need troopsI - You'd be in prison without my men.

149
01:08:06,777 --> 01:08:08,529
一切都听你的
As you command.

150
01:08:06,937 --> 01:08:10,896
你说的好像我的Dalek 再不能战斗了一样
You speak as though my Daleks are no longer capable of war.

151
01:08:10,057 --> 01:08:13,129
- 怎么了 - 小意外
- What happened? - A small accident.

152
01:08:11,097 --> 01:08:13,372
在你服刑期间发生了很多事情
A lot has happened during your imprisonment.

153
01:08:13,577 --> 01:08:16,489
跟Movellans的战争结束了
The war with the Movellans is over?

154
01:08:16,057 --> 01:08:20,255
- 你还好吗 - 我抓到了自己的手 没事
- Are you all right? - I caught my hand. It's nothing.

155
01:08:16,657 --> 01:08:19,535
是的 尽管伤亡惨重
Yes, although casualties were very high.

156
01:08:19,697 --> 01:08:22,006
喜闻乐见
It is to be expected.

157
01:08:20,457 --> 01:08:25,975
不是这儿 我们还没找到时间走廊的入口
It isn't here. We haven't found the entrance to the Time Corridor either.

158
01:08:22,177 --> 01:08:24,850
我说的是Dalek伤亡惨重
I'm talking about Dalek casualties.

159
01:08:26,137 --> 01:08:28,412
Dalek...伤亡惨重
Dalek...casualties?

160
01:08:26,137 --> 01:08:28,128
我想暂时还连接不上
Temporarily disconnected, I would think.

161
01:08:28,617 --> 01:08:31,370
他们输了, Davros. 他们完全被打败了
They lost, Davros. They were totally defeated.

162
01:08:31,697 --> 01:08:33,494
博士...
Doctor...

163
01:08:38,617 --> 01:08:40,926
- 那是什么 - 没有 什么都没有
- What is it? - Nothing. Nothing.

164
01:08:41,097 --> 01:08:43,452
继续找
Go on with the search.

165
01:08:56,137 --> 01:08:59,174
对宇宙的征服者来说这太过了
So much for the conqueror of the universe.

166
01:08:59,337 --> 01:09:01,328
我告诉你它已经走了
I told you it had gone.

167
01:09:06,777 --> 01:09:10,611
我们还是用 适当的程序来对付博士
We will deal with the Doctor in due course.

168
01:09:15,377 --> 01:09:19,973
- 它死了吗  - 你要不要自己去看一下 
- Is it dead? - Would you care to take a look?

169
01:09:20,577 --> 01:09:22,568
他怎么样
How is he?

170
01:09:21,577 --> 01:09:24,569
- 我们要去哪里 - 戴好面罩
- Where are we going? - Keep your mask down.

171
01:09:22,737 --> 01:09:24,728
只是受惊了 身体应该没事
It's more shock than physical.

172
01:09:24,737 --> 01:09:28,889
- 周围可能还有毒气 - 那又怎样 我宁愿快点死掉
- There could still be gas around. - So what? I'd rather die quickly.

173
01:09:24,897 --> 01:09:26,888
过来 孩子 我们带你去楼下
Come on, lad. Let's get you downstairs.

174
01:09:29,097 --> 01:09:31,770
我们在这儿待了多久了
How long are we going to wander around?

175
01:09:29,377 --> 01:09:32,255
- 怎么了 - Dalek还没死透透
- What happened? - The Dalek wasn't quite dead.

176
01:09:31,977 --> 01:09:35,686
据我所知 只有我们四个还活着
As far as we know, there are only four of us still alive.

177
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:34,612
- 拿着 - 帮我一把
- Here. - Give us a hand.

178
01:09:34,777 --> 01:09:36,608
好的
Of course.

179
01:09:35,857 --> 01:09:40,647
- 我们不能孤身对抗Dalek - 你想战斗到底
- We can't fight the Daleks alone. - You wanted to fight to the end.

180
01:09:40,817 --> 01:09:43,615
看看他们所到之处 一堆死人
Look where it got me. A dead crew.

181
01:09:43,817 --> 01:09:46,411
既然这样 那就不要让他们白白牺牲
Then don't let it be for nothing.

182
01:09:48,577 --> 01:09:50,807
我们能做些什么
What can we do?

183
01:09:52,657 --> 01:09:55,933
你忘了这个地方有一套自毁系统吗
Have you forgotten this station has a self-destruct system?

184
01:09:56,457 --> 01:09:59,688
- 我需要个工程师 - 我们必须登上Dalek的飞船
- I require an engineer. - We must board the Dalek ship.

185
01:10:46,777 --> 01:10:48,768
他很安静
He's very still.

186
01:10:56,017 --> 01:10:58,008
他死了吗
Is he dead?

187
01:11:00,897 --> 01:11:02,694
我想没有
I think not.

188
01:11:19,057 --> 01:11:21,048
马上就准备好了
Soon be ready.

189
01:11:21,217 --> 01:11:23,367
我们可以用更强大的东西来做这个
We could do with something stronger.

190
01:11:23,257 --> 01:11:25,248
- 卫兵 - 保卫好他们
- Guards? - An escort.

191
01:11:23,537 --> 01:11:27,450
- 楼上你朋友怎么样了 - 他死了
- How's your friend upstairs? - He's dead.

192
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:27,408
这儿还有大批的工作人员
There are still some crew at large.

193
01:11:28,497 --> 01:11:31,295
这纯粹是一个预防措施
It's purely a precaution.

194
01:11:33,177 --> 01:11:37,693
我很难被杀的 你早应该知道
I am very difficult to kill. You should already know that.

195
01:12:00,737 --> 01:12:02,887
很好
ExcellentI

196
01:12:03,057 --> 01:12:06,936
一旦我榨干他的脑子 获得所有的知识,
Once I have drained his mind of all knowledge,

197
01:12:07,097 --> 01:12:11,056
他就慢慢等死吧 痛入骨髓的死吧
he shall then die slowly and painfullyI

198
01:12:11,497 --> 01:12:15,775
这是他最后一次介入了
He has interfered for the last time.

199
01:12:16,337 --> 01:12:19,170
- 别这样! - 不要看 如果这让你不舒服的话
- Don't! - Don't look if it offends you.

200
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:23,768
- 看, 他什么都不知道 - 他不是船上的人
- Look, he doesn't know anything. - He's not one of the crew.

201
01:12:23,937 --> 01:12:27,566
- 他一定是跟Dalek一起的 - 我来自地球
- He must be with the Daleks. - I'm from Earth.

202
01:12:27,737 --> 01:12:31,810
- 那么 你是怎么到这儿的 - 从Dalek的时间走廊
- Then, how did you get here? - The Daleks' Time Corridor.

203
01:12:31,977 --> 01:12:36,255
- 你们相信吗 - 为什么不 我们知道Dalek无所不能
- Do you believe that? - We know the Daleks are capable.

204
01:12:36,417 --> 01:12:38,851
- 那我们让他进来吧 - 不
- So we're letting him go. - No,

205
01:12:39,017 --> 01:12:43,533
但是我们不能在这儿等着Dalek找到我们
but we're not waiting here for the Daleks to find us, either.

206
01:12:44,177 --> 01:12:46,896
- 有人要喝茶吗  - 不用 谢谢
- Anyone want some tea? - No, thanks.

207
01:12:47,057 --> 01:12:51,494
我好希望上校回来 他还要多久 
I'd rather have the Colonel back. How much longer will he be?

208
01:12:54,097 --> 01:12:56,088
喂 你去哪儿 孩子
Hey, where are you going, lad?

209
01:12:58,537 --> 01:13:01,097
过来 你这样子就不用执行任务...
Come on. You're excused duties...

210
01:13:03,537 --> 01:13:07,815
- 你还好吗 - 是的 你待这儿别动
- Are you all right? - Yeah. You stay there.

211
01:13:09,297 --> 01:13:10,616
他是怎么了
What's that about?

212
01:13:29,937 --> 01:13:31,928
快点儿 孩子
Come on, lad.

213
01:13:32,097 --> 01:13:34,167
不用担心
There's nothing to worry about.

214
01:13:34,337 --> 01:13:36,567
那是Calder警官
It's only Sergeant Calder.

215
01:13:45,897 --> 01:13:49,810
上校去找救护车了 你一会儿就会好的

我们休息一会儿
We'll rest for a moment.

217
01:21:01,697 --> 01:21:06,293
你们都不突发奇想吗 我想拿一切换一杯矿泉水
Don't you get funny ideas? I'd give anything for a glass of spring water.

218
01:44:37,617 --> 01:44:42,372
这是在浪费时间  变异体利用了时间走廊
This is a waste of time. The mutant could have used the Time Corridor.

219
01:44:42,537 --> 01:44:45,609
没错 那你为什么在那里踌躇的寻找 
True. So why be so tentative in your search?

220
01:44:45,777 --> 01:44:50,726
- 我们还不能确切的知道 - 那就是我们寻找的原因
- We don't know for certain. - That's why we're searching

221
01:44:50,897 --> 01:44:54,253
- 它看起来像什么 - 你不会弄错它的
- What does it look like? - You won't mistake it.

222
01:44:54,417 --> 01:44:57,853
当你看到它 它会试图杀了你
The moment you find it, it'll try and kill you.

223
01:45:32,697 --> 01:45:36,656
- 杀了他! - 等等 先审审他
- Kill him! - Wait. Question him first.

224
01:45:36,817 --> 01:45:41,572

- He'd be more comfortable here. - Stay there.

227
01:45:50,257 --> 01:45:52,248
看起来只是破了皮
It looks superficial.

228
01:45:53,377 --> 01:45:57,814
但愿里面没毒 可能是外星人造成的
As long as there's no poison in it. It was caused by an alien.

229
01:45:57,977 --> 01:46:01,811
不知道是什么进入了他的血液
We don't know what may have entered his bloodstream.

230
01:46:01,977 --> 01:46:05,492
上校马上就回来了 我们要把他们俩都送进医院

233
