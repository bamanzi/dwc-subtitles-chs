2
00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:18,464
- You've calculated where we are?
- The instruments are still affected.

3
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:21,858
But I think it's 1984. London.

4
00:00:23,507 --> 00:00:27,341
- Found it!
- Doctor, where are you going?

5
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:32,820
The Time Corridor. I want to
find out what all this is about.

6
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:37,435
Such neglect.

7
00:00:37,607 --> 00:00:40,599
A hundred years ago,
this place would've been bustling.

8
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:45,443
It might be again, if we find out
who's operating the Time Corridor.

9
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:47,784
Come on. The trouble with you, Tegen,
is that you have no imagination.

10
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:51,286
a load of crumbling brickwork!

11
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:03,996
- Don't come in here. Soldiers!
- What?

12
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:11,845
- He'll be all right.
- Look at the way he's dressed

13
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:14,965
He must have come down the Time Corridor.

14
00:01:17,727 --> 00:01:22,437
- You've got to help me.
- What happened?

15
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:27,965
The Time Corridor's on the next level.
Be careful.

16
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:45,165
Dark...isn't it?

17
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:51,119
- Look around.
- I can't see Galloway's body.

18
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:54,597
Look, Doctor.

19
00:01:55,727 --> 00:01:57,046
Bullets.

20
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:01,961
- Recently fired.
- Hardly alien.

21
00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:05,119
Why advertise who you are, huh?

22
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:11,717
Where's Turlough?

23
00:02:12,847 --> 00:02:15,042
Turlough?
Turlough?

24
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:18,317
Where's he gone?

25
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:20,682
Turlough?
Turlough?

26
00:02:26,887 --> 00:02:29,924
- Did you hear that?
- No, sir.

27
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:32,478
I thought I heard voices.

28
00:02:36,347 --> 00:02:38,417
Turlough!
Turlough!

29
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:44,979
May I help you, gentlemen?
This is private property.

30
00:02:45,147 --> 00:02:50,904
I'm sorry about this, this friend of mine wandered
in here by mistake and we're looking for him.

31
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:53,058
I haven't seen him.

32
00:02:53,947 --> 00:02:57,462
- What's going on?
- Precisely what I'm trying to find out.

33
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:02,098
- Who's there?
- Don't harm her, please!

34
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:05,418
- She's a friend.
- Sorry, Doctor.

35
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:10,620
- Look!
- What is it?

36
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:13,347
A Dalek! Take cover!

37
00:03:15,187 --> 00:03:19,499
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!

38
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:23,546
Exterminate! Exterminate!

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,999

40
00:03:58,027 --> 00:04:00,416
- Where did they come from?
- The Time Corridor.

41
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:02,578
- From the ship you were on?
- Must be.

42
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:04,738
- What do they want?
- I hope we never find out.

43
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:07,745
Aim for the eyepiece on the dome.

44
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:16,460
My vision is impaired! I cannot see!

45
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:19,016
My vision is impaired! I cannot see!

46
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:22,338
- Quickly!
- I cannot see

47
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:26,102
I cannot see. Warning! Warning!
My vision is impaired

48
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:30,021
- Open the door!
- I cannot see. I cannot see

49
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,178
Warning! Emergency!

50
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:43,585
She's all right. We should get her downstairs.

51
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:47,820
While you're doing that,
I'd like a hand with the debris outside.

52
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:53,901
The Dalek sent to the warehouse has been destroyed.

53
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:56,302
How is that possible?

54
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:59,863
The Doctor was aided by the Earth soldiers.

55
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:03,702
Seal the warehouse terminal of the Time Corridor.

56
00:05:15,907 --> 00:05:18,467
- How is she?
- She's sleeping naturally.

57
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:22,302
- Tea, sir?
- Thank you.

58
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:24,822
Who discovered these cylinders?

59
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:27,376
Builders converting the warehouse into flats.

60
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:29,538
Thought they were unexploded bombs.

61
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:33,256
- Have you tried to open one?
- Haven't even scratched the casing

62
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:35,941
You think the Daleks anything to do with this?

63
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:40,419
It would be an enormous coincidence if they didn't.

64
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:42,778
Who are you?

65
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:49,616
- How long is your tour of duty?
- Two years.

66
00:05:49,787 --> 00:05:52,745
Captain normally allows new arrivals to settle in,

67
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:57,577
before subjecting them to the
tedium of Officer-of-the-Watch.

68
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:59,939
- What did you do?
- I complained.

69
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,739
Someone should have warned you.

70
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:04,104
I had every right. Have you seen
the state of the defence system?

71
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:06,802
- You fear attack?
- That's not the point.

72
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:12,464
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it. The only ship
we ever see around here is our supply vessel.

73
00:06:12,627 --> 00:06:15,300
I think you may have spoken too soon.

74
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:20,222
Sensors have picked up a ship in the exclusion zone.

75
00:06:20,387 --> 00:06:24,426
- Inform the captain.
- I wouldn't bother him. Not yet.

76
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:28,978
It could be anything.
Let the fighters check it out first.

77
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:32,419
They'll be grateful for the practice!

78
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:43,383
Checklist completed, all systems functioning.

79
00:06:43,547 --> 00:06:45,538
Raise the force shield.

80
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:49,985
All troopers to battle stations.

81
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:52,138
Battle speed!

82
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:58,936
Fighter leader has made visual contact.
It's a battle cruiser!

83
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:01,780
Go to red alert. Inform the captain.

84
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:04,700
Sensors report we're being scanned, sir.

85
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:07,816
Red alert at once!

86
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:15,564
We've been hit!

87
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,366
- What's happening?
- Engineering report...

88
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,486
- What's happening?
- Damage to the generating plant.

89
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:25,286
Cruiser's closing in, sir.

90
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:28,359
I've lost contact with the fighters.

91
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:30,165
Open fire!

92
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:33,205
I said open fire!

93
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:35,244
I can't!

94
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:40,276
We don't have enough power for the
laser cannon. We're defenceless!

95
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:47,106
- Cruiser preparing to dock.
- Which airlock?

96
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,643
Three. Maintenance team's working on it.

97
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,100
I want every available man down there.

98
00:07:52,207 --> 00:07:54,358
Block the corridor with anything they can find.

99
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:05,557
- How long before they dock?
- Three minutes.

100
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:10,202
- We'd better go down to the airlock.
- Right.

101
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:15,281
Should we be boarded, destroy the prisoner.

102
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:17,039
Good luck.

103
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,285
0-3 to HQ? 0-3 to HQ? Over.

104
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:30,517
- Keep trying.
- You must get reinforcements.

105
00:08:30,687 --> 00:08:34,475
I can't conjure them out of the air.
I need a telephone.

106
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:39,243
- I'll go. You're needed here.
- It's more than a military matter.

107
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:45,039
I have to speak to the MOD.
We'll need massive troop involvement.

108
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:49,281
I'll come with you.

109
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:53,884
You're the only one who knows
anything about fighting Daleks.

110
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:56,038
Your duty's here.

111
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:26,664
Gentlemen, you've saved my life.

112
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:30,581
I'm Colonel Archer, Bomb Disposal Squad.

113
00:09:30,747 --> 00:09:34,865
I have to make an urgent call.
May I use your radio?

114
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,664
Please.

115
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:41,218
Thank you.

116
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:46,378
It's dead.

117
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:41,801
- Under attack! Withdraw!
- Withdraw! Under attack!

118
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:43,802
- Regroup! Regroup!

119
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:48,363
Fools! I told you this would happen,
they'd mine the corridor!

120
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:50,920
The attack must continue!

121
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:52,878
Only this time as I planned.

122
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,438
Fire!

123
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:01,721
Masks down! Masks down!

124
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:24,486
Move it!

125
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:31,279
We're finished. It's every man for himself!

126
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:34,245
Destroy the prisoner.

127
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:40,600
It's not working!

128
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:49,978
He is a companion of the Doctor.

129
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:52,263
He should be destroyed.

130
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:55,698
He would be better used as bait.

131
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:59,746
The Doctor is sentimental and emotional.

132
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:02,660
He will come after the boy.

133
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:05,295
This will aid the Dalek plan.

134
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:09,061
Allow the boy to roam freely.

135
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:12,865
We must get back to the TARDIS.
I have to find the Dalek ship.

136
00:12:13,027 --> 00:12:15,700
I'm not going back there.
They'll kill me.

137
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:19,980
- I need your help.
- You don't know how much of a coward I am.

138
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:24,578
You can take this opportunity to show me.
Come along.

139
00:12:42,187 --> 00:12:45,577
Oh! Does nothing work properly?

140
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:51,464
Try here!

141
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:58,257
What's that smell?

142
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:04,177
Activate the exit to the Time Corridor.

143
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,458
We obey.

144
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:17,737
Exterminate! Exterminate!

145
00:13:17,907 --> 00:13:20,182
Exterminate! Exterminate!

146
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:24,022
Exterminate! Exterminate!

147
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:27,941
Exterminate! Exterminate!

148
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:32,322
- That was gunfire.
- Quickly! We should get out.

149
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:34,284
Quickly!

150
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:45,883
There's nothing to worry about.

151
00:13:56,507 --> 00:14:00,182
Right, explosive charges primed.

152
00:14:02,787 --> 00:14:04,743
What is that smell?

153
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:15,777
- Keep back.
- Help me!

154
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:17,380
Stay away!

155
00:14:17,547 --> 00:14:19,583
What's happening to me?

156
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:40,860
No!

157
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:52,266
Disarmed.

158
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:56,140
Release Davros.

159
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,046
That's not Colonel Archer.

160
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:15,564
He gave the Doctor his gun belt,
yet he's wearing one.

161
00:15:17,487 --> 00:15:21,765
- What are you whispering about?
- I was wondering when will the ambulance for Tegen arrive?

162
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:24,945
- That is in hand.
- The reinforcements?

163
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:28,783
That is a military matter
and therefore confidential.

164
00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:31,586
I don't think we'll wait for the ambulance.

165
00:15:31,787 --> 00:15:34,426
This warehouse is under martial law.

166
00:15:34,627 --> 00:15:37,221
Attempt to leave and I'll have you shot.

167
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:42,404
Ninety years I was frozen in that.

168
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:46,355
Ninety years of mind-numbing boredom.

169
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:49,803
- You were conscious?
- Every second.

170
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:53,596
The creatures of Earth have
no stomach for judicial murder.

171
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:57,641
They prefer to leave you to slowly rot and die.

172
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:01,315
They call it being humane.

173
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,917
Then you must be equally humane in your revenge.

174
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:09,598
It is a planet I shall destroy at my leisure.

175
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:13,601
But first, I must deal with a meddling Time Lord.

176
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,759
- That's been anticipated.
- You have the Doctor?

177
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:19,162
His capture is imminent.

178
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:23,182
That's it. I've located the Dalek ship.

179
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:25,677
I'll drop you off at the warehiuse
when I collect Tegan.

180
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:28,077
- I'll come with you.
- Good man.

181
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:36,318
The Doctor's Tardis has been
caught in the Time Corridor.

182
00:16:36,487 --> 00:16:40,685
- Prepare the duplication room.
- I obey.

183
00:16:51,047 --> 00:16:53,038
Turlough?

184
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,438
Turlough?

185
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:02,805
Foolish boy...Shh!

186
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:06,726
Quickly! Let's get out of here.

187
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:08,728
No, Doctor.

188
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,808
This is madness.

189
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:16,447
The Daleks won't thank you
for capturing me. They'll kill you.

190
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:18,608
I didn't quite tell the truth.

191
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:22,053
I serve the Daleks. I'm a Dalek agent.

192
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:28,317
Exterminate the Doctor!
Exterminate the Doctor!

193
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:30,444
- Exterm...
- Wait!

194
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:34,839
He is an enemy of the Daleks.
He must be exterminated.

195
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:37,481
He must be duplicated first.

196
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,481
Confirm with the Supreme Dalek.

197
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:54,320
Supreme Dalek confirms the order.

198
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:57,718
We must take the prisoner
to the duplication chamber.

199
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:59,843
Proceed.

200
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:10,284
- Impulsive, aren't they?
- They'd kill anybody,

201
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:12,438
even if they need them.

202
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:14,875
How long before it's your turn

203
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:19,528
Down!

204
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,408
Fire!

205
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,648
Careful.

206
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,848
Uniforms!

207
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:49,768
Uniforms.

208
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,407
We should leave here at once.

209
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:58,007
Without Davros, we have no future.

210
00:18:58,177 --> 00:19:02,090
He must be made to believe that we serve him.

211
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:05,867
The Daleks and the Movellans
were locked in an impasse.

212
00:19:06,037 --> 00:19:08,346
Each time their respective fleets
attempted a stratagem,

213
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:12,954
it was instantly anticipated and countered
by their opponent's battle computer.

214
00:19:13,177 --> 00:19:14,807
Then the Movellans found the answer.

215
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:17,368
Sorry, sir.

216
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:19,533
Quickly, tell me.

217
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:23,531
They developed a virus
which exclusively attacks the Daleks.

218
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:26,106
The fleet was destroyed. Those who survived
went to separate parts of the Universe

219
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:30,456
to avoid the risk of further
infection and to work on a cure.

220
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:33,888
- Have they succeeded? - Not yet.

221
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:36,258
What would do you with my duplicate?

222
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:41,103
- That does no t concern you.
- Oh, I think it does. I'm rather attached to myself.

223
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,985
You will remain silent.

224
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:47,457
I assume my brain waves are destined for Davros.

225
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:49,583
You must need his services very badly.

226
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:54,497
Daleks are the superior being.
We do not require assistance.

227
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:59,377
Superior? It took you long enough to
ensnare the Tardis in the Time Corridor.

228
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:03,665
- It was but one trap.
- Hm. Stien was more effective.

229
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:07,860
- A living, thinking being, not some tin-pot machine.
- Please, Doctor!

230
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:12,060
Stien is but an extension of Dalek technology.

231
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:15,985
- What? - He is a duplicate.

232
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:19,344
He is a product of our genetic engineering.

233
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:24,459
- Are you all duplicates? - Yes.

234
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:28,900
Interesting. I wonder
what happened to the real you.

235
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:33,996
It is vital you complete
your researches as soon as possible.

236
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:39,477
- I need a sample of the Movellan virus.
- It will be brought to you.

237
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:42,685
I will also need two Daleks

238
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:44,405
for experimentation.

239
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:46,404
That is forbidden.

240
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:50,998
If I am to find a cure,
I will need living Dalek tissue.

241
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:56,237
- We must consult the Supreme Dalek.
- Do so! But be quick!

242
00:20:56,407 --> 00:21:00,446
The self-destruct chamber has been invaded.

243
00:21:00,687 --> 00:21:03,679
The hostiles must be exterminated.

244
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,645
There isn't time. Abandon the station.

245
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,560
You should have anticipated this.

246
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:13,766
The original plan was to snatch Davros and leave.

247
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:17,317
Nothing must endanger Davros.

248
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:24,040
The hostiles must be destroyed.
The Daleks must be obeyed!

249
00:21:30,827 --> 00:21:33,705
That's outside! Close the door!
Dalek troopers!

250
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:42,541
They must have seen us.
Take out that camera.

251
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:47,502
Build a barricade for protection.

252
00:21:47,627 --> 00:21:51,586
- Have the soldiers been duplicated?
- Yes.

253
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:53,783
It's so clever. Do tell me how it's done.

254
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:55,938
- No.
- Thought you wouldn't.

255
00:21:56,707 --> 00:21:58,425
What about Tegan?

256
00:21:58,947 --> 00:22:03,543
- She is our prisoner.
- She's harmless. You must release her.

257
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:05,946
Show him.

258
00:22:20,587 --> 00:22:23,147
- Why?
- A Doctor with no companions

259
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:26,777
- would be rather incongruous.
- Why are you doing this?

260
00:22:26,947 --> 00:22:30,098
Your duplicates will return to Gallifrey.

261
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:35,819
At our command, you will assassinate
members of the High Council.

262
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:38,106
No!

263
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:45,998
We have been sent by the Supreme Dalek.

264
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:49,045
We are to assist in your research.

265
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:54,844
- I need Dalek tissue, not help.
- You may remove tissue from us.

266
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:56,925
Excellent.

267
00:22:58,087 --> 00:23:01,921
In no way will my experiment harm.

268
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:05,360
Releasing locking clamp.

269
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:19,246
In fact, you will become
considerably invigorated.

270
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:27,999
Perfect.

271
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:31,762
Reseal your casings.

272
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:35,766
Now....

273
00:23:36,527 --> 00:23:39,439
Who do you obey?

274
00:23:39,647 --> 00:23:44,323
We obey Davros. He is our Master!

275
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:46,006
Excellent.

276
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:50,726
Now all I require is a sample
of the Movellan virus.

277
00:23:50,827 --> 00:23:57,426
Order a cylinder of Movellan virus
to be transported from Earth.

278
00:23:57,627 --> 00:23:59,424
I obey.

279
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:10,061
Take the cylinder to Davros.

280
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:25,979
Perfect.

281
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:28,578
I have but one more request.

282
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:33,536
I require your co-operation a little longer.

283
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:38,778
A spirited but foolish reaction.
He will make an excellent slave.

284
00:24:40,907 --> 00:24:42,898
And so will you.

285
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:50,458
- Are you ready?
- You ask it as though I have a choice.

286
00:24:50,627 --> 00:24:55,018
Everyone has a ch...oice.
It's in the C-Constitution, 25th Amendment.

287
00:24:55,187 --> 00:25:00,181
- Didn't you go to school?
- Maybe we didn't go to the same school.

288
00:25:00,347 --> 00:25:04,659
- Which school did you go to?
- I-I c-can't remember.

289
00:25:04,827 --> 00:25:09,821
You remember the Amendments!
What was the First? It's important that I know.

290
00:25:09,987 --> 00:25:11,818
And that you remember.

291
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:17,385
Think! Search the area of
your mind that's been shut off.

292
00:25:17,587 --> 00:25:20,055
Resist before it's too late.

293
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:22,383
I must cont...inue.

294
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:24,706
Resist!

295
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,302
I must con...tinue.

296
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:39,079

297
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,779

298
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:42,979

299
00:25:42,979 --> 00:25:43,779

300
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:44,879

301
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:46,880

302
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,379

303
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:50,979

304
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:52,479

305
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:53,779

306
00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:54,979

307
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:59,236
Relax, Doctor. Don't fight it.
You'll only cause yourself...pain.

308
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:56,279

309
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,879

310
00:25:57,879 --> 00:25:58,979

311
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:03,846
I-I know you you feel.
The pain will pass. Relax.

312
00:26:04,007 --> 00:26:05,326
Quickly!

313
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,879

314
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:08,201
Recite the Amendments!

315
00:26:08,407 --> 00:26:12,400
- I must do my duty.
- You must resist.

316
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:14,956
You are destroying my mind.

317
00:26:16,047 --> 00:26:17,639
Stand by.

318
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:20,966
That's it.

319
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:27,763
Aaaagh!

320
00:26:40,027 --> 00:26:43,417
- Get them into the Time Corridor.
- Aaagh!

321
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:47,501
No...! Aaaaaagh!

322
00:26:48,947 --> 00:26:51,336
Into the Time Corridor with her.

323
00:27:04,598 --> 00:27:05,398

324
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:06,198

325
00:27:06,198 --> 00:27:07,098

326
00:27:07,098 --> 00:27:07,998

327
00:27:07,998 --> 00:27:08,898

328
00:27:08,898 --> 00:27:09,798

329
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,798

330
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:13,098

331
00:27:19,947 --> 00:27:22,336
The Daleks have secured the station.
It is safe.

332
00:27:23,347 --> 00:27:24,575
Excellent.

333
00:27:24,747 --> 00:27:28,899
- The Doctor has been taken prisoner.
- Better still.

334
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:35,063
He must be brought to me at once.
Hurry. There is important work to do.

335
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:39,622
I have waited a long time for this.

336
00:28:01,787 --> 00:28:05,018
- What are you doing?!
- She was about to scream.

337
00:28:05,187 --> 00:28:07,178
It's Tegan. She's a friend.

338
00:28:07,347 --> 00:28:12,467
- Turlough... Who's this?
- Never mind. We must get away. Now

339
00:28:12,627 --> 00:28:15,016
- Not without the Doctor. - He's here?

340
00:28:15,187 --> 00:28:17,178
Look behind you.

341
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:20,598

342
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:21,698

343
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:22,798

344
00:28:22,898 --> 00:28:23,898

345
00:28:23,898 --> 00:28:24,898

346
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:26,498

347
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:28,898

348
00:28:31,907 --> 00:28:34,899
I can't stand the confusion in my mind.

349
00:28:43,027 --> 00:28:45,905
Quickly... Release me.

350
00:28:46,987 --> 00:28:51,026
- What about the guards?
- We'll call them in here.

351
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:55,462
You must secure the Tardis for me.
Take the troopers.

352
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,976
We obey

353
00:28:58,627 --> 00:29:00,424
In here!

354
00:29:07,387 --> 00:29:11,699
Now what? Dalek conditioning
could c-cloud my mind at any time.

355
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:17,897
- You'll be safe in the Tardis.
- You don't understand. I could kill you.

356
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:19,946
I'll chance it.

357
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:28,462
- Doctor!
- Don't just stand there. Come and help.

358
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:32,865
The Doctor is free.
Your troopers have failed.

359
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:35,740
And where were your Daleks?

360
00:29:38,387 --> 00:29:41,265
This is Lytton.
Call out my Special Guard.

361
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:48,425
Doctor, look. We should get out of here.

362
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:50,740
Quickly!

363
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:08,302
Lytton grows too arrogant.
His mind resists our control.

364
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:15,498
He must be exterminated as soon as
it is convenient to the Daleks.

365
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:20,897
- Lytton.
- Davros has control of two Daleks.

366
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:26,903
They are in the reception area,
attempting to enter the Doctor's Tardis.

367
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:30,776
- You must exterminate them.
- At once.

368
00:30:30,947 --> 00:30:34,178
You must also destroy Davros.

369
00:30:34,347 --> 00:30:38,818
He is unreliable. He cannot be trusted.

370
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:46,139
Go. Release the virus in the Dalek ship.

371
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:51,218
Davros's Daleks?

372
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:54,697
Destroy them. The Supreme Dalek's order.

373
00:30:54,907 --> 00:31:00,061
The Tardis is not on this level.
We must search elsewhere.

374
00:31:00,747 --> 00:31:03,341
Now!

375
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:18,989
Behind you!

376
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:47,705
Take cover!

377
00:31:52,947 --> 00:31:55,142
We are ready to descend.

378
00:31:55,307 --> 00:32:00,939
Proceed. Everything must be exterminated,

379
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:04,224
including Lytton and his troopers.

380
00:32:04,387 --> 00:32:06,298
We obey.

381
00:32:25,427 --> 00:32:26,860
Stop

382
00:32:27,627 --> 00:32:29,060
Exterminate

383
00:33:06,627 --> 00:33:10,540
We must find the Tardis.
That is our prime mission.

384
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:12,902
We must obey Davros.

385
00:33:23,227 --> 00:33:27,220
- What is happening?
- We are being attacked.

386
00:33:27,387 --> 00:33:30,220
The Supreme Dalek wishes us destroyed.

387
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:33,902
The invading Daleks must be exterminated.

388
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:37,622
Daleks, to the self-destruct chamber.

389
00:33:37,787 --> 00:33:43,862
A hostile has broken in.
Emergency Emergency

390
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:46,621
He must be stopped.

391
00:33:47,307 --> 00:33:52,700
We must find the traitors.
The enemy of the Daleks must be destroyed.

392
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:57,987
We are not traitors.
We serve our creator, Davros.

393
00:33:58,187 --> 00:34:02,897
The Supreme Dalek is your ruler.
He must be obeyed at all times.

394
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:07,817
- Davros must be honoured.
- He must be exterminated.

395
00:34:07,987 --> 00:34:11,582
Nothing must impede
the true destiny of the Daleks

396
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:15,626
You must be exterminated. Exterminated

397
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,539
Exterminated

398
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,137
- Doctor!
- Well done.

399
00:35:06,307 --> 00:35:11,142
She's been trying to open the cylinder.
I warned her she could start an epidemic.

400
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:14,458
The virus attacks only Daleks. Then it will die.

401
00:35:14,627 --> 00:35:17,664
What's happening on the next floor?

402
00:35:18,587 --> 00:35:20,782
Lunch has arrived.

403
00:35:27,747 --> 00:35:29,783
Now for the Daleks.

404
00:35:42,187 --> 00:35:45,145
I did not summon your assistance.

405
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:48,140
We are here to exterminate you.

406
00:35:48,307 --> 00:35:51,617
- By whose order?
- The Supreme Dalek.

407
00:35:51,827 --> 00:35:56,105
Exterminate me, and you abandon
your lives without purpose.

408
00:35:56,307 --> 00:36:00,858
Join me, and I will
make you rulers of the universe!

409
00:36:01,987 --> 00:36:03,466
Malfunction

410
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:05,618
- Emergency!
- Malfunction!

411
00:36:05,827 --> 00:36:08,466
Your lives are over!

412
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:09,946
System failure!

413
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:18,658
Open the doors.

414
00:36:41,027 --> 00:36:43,700
What is happening? I cannot see.

415
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:47,701
- I cannot see!  My vision is impaired!
- Emergency

416
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:50,018
They are dying.

417
00:36:50,747 --> 00:36:52,738
And so are you.

418
00:36:57,267 --> 00:37:01,897
- I cannot see
- Emergency! Emergency!

419
00:37:04,747 --> 00:37:07,136
The Daleks are dead.

420
00:37:08,107 --> 00:37:10,701
Long live the new Daleks!

421
00:37:12,787 --> 00:37:14,186
Oh...!

422
00:37:14,347 --> 00:37:16,338
What is happening?

423
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:18,578
No...! No!

424
00:37:18,747 --> 00:37:23,343
It cannot be! I...am...not...a...Dalek!

425
00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:25,936
I...cannot...die!

426
00:37:26,107 --> 00:37:28,143
I...am...

427
00:37:28,307 --> 00:37:30,901
DAAAAVROSSSS!

428
00:37:46,227 --> 00:37:48,457
- It's over.
- It was horrible.

429
00:37:48,627 --> 00:37:52,618
The Earth is safe, at least
until the Daleks find an antidote.

430
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:54,106
Doctor! Look

431
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:57,100
You have not won, Doctor.

432
00:37:57,307 --> 00:38:01,619
- You won't be able to invade Earth!
- You forget, Doctor.

433
00:38:01,787 --> 00:38:05,302
Daleks do not need to invade.

434
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:08,140
I have my duplicates.

435
00:38:08,307 --> 00:38:15,418
Some have already been placed in
strategic positions around the planet.

436
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:20,103
The collapse of Earth society will soon occur.

437
00:38:20,987 --> 00:38:23,740
Your duplicates aren't stable.

438
00:38:23,947 --> 00:38:26,620
The Daleks will triumph.

439
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:29,176
We cannot fail.

440
00:38:29,347 --> 00:38:34,421
The Daleks' true destiny is to rule the universe.

441
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:43,697
Hello, boys. Just in time for the fun.

442
00:39:06,707 --> 00:39:09,904
- The Dalek ship has been destroyed.
- How?

443
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:13,823
- The self-destruct device on the station.
- Davros?

444
00:39:14,027 --> 00:39:15,540
No, no...

445
00:39:15,707 --> 00:39:19,825
Stien, I would think. He must have
finally decided which side he was on.

446
00:39:21,327 --> 00:39:24,956
- Are all the duplicates unstable?
- Oh, yes.

447
00:39:25,127 --> 00:39:29,279
Yes, given time,
they will be free of Dalek control.

448
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:36,206
- Should we inform Earth's authorities?
- Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Come along.

449
00:39:38,407 --> 00:39:40,796
I'm not coming with you.

450
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:52,124
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm tired of it.

451
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:58,163
- What's the matter?
- A lot of good people died today.

452
00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:01,999
- I'm sick of it.
- You think I want this?

453
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:03,966
No.

454
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,995
I just don't think I can go on.

455
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:13,160
- You want to stay on Earth?
- My Aunt Vanessa said,

456
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:16,799
when I became an air stewardess,

457
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:19,561
- if you stop enjoying it, give it up.
- Tegan

458
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:22,446
It's stopped being fun, Doctor!

459
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,086
Goodbye.

460
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:29,766
Turlough?

461
00:40:30,407 --> 00:40:31,806
Goodbye.

462
00:40:31,967 --> 00:40:33,958
I'll miss you both.

463
00:40:34,887 --> 00:40:38,766
- No! No, don't leave, not like this.
- I must. I'm sorry.

464
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,364
Goodbye.

465
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:50,635
It's, uh, strange.

466
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:53,799
I left Gallifrey for similar reasons.

467
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:56,765
I'd grown tired of their lifestyle.

468
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:00,045
It seems I must mend my ways.

469
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:03,646
Come on.
