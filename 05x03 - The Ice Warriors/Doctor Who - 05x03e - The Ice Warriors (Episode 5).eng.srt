1
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:09,006
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:07,874
Who are you?

3
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,694
I never answer questions
until I'm properly introduced.

4
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:15,249
You will answer now.

5
00:01:17,419 --> 00:01:35,887
Very well. You are standing in the airlock to this spacecraft. Unless you answer my
questions within ten seconds, I will take the atmospheric pressure around you down to zero.

6
00:01:36,212 --> 00:01:38,308
But... but if you do
that my body will explode!

7
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:47,816
One... two... three...

8
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:52,391
Oh alright! Alright! But I don't
think much of your hospitality!

9
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:57,959
Identify yourself.

10
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,074
Me? I... I'm a scientist.
I've come to talk with you.

11
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:05,191
To help you.

12
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,632
A scientist?

13
00:02:08,346 --> 00:02:11,066
Yes, yes you could call me that.

14
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:14,288
You do not look like a scientist.

15
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:15,959
Well looks aren't everything you know!

16
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:23,511
You look more like a
scavenger. We killed him.

17
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:27,850
Well if you kill me, you'll ruin
any chance you may have of escape.

18
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:31,411
Do you think he can help us?

19
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:38,913
He cannot afford to
lie. Allow him to enter.

20
00:02:40,936 --> 00:02:43,132
Ah, thank you very much,
that's very civil of you.

21
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:44,254
Oh, my word!

22
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:46,245
You claim to be able to help us.

23
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:57,195
No... I am sure I can help
you. On certain conditions.

24
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:02,832
You are our prisoner. It
is we who set conditions.

25
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:10,807
On the contrary, it is you who are
the prisoner, and I can help you!

26
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:24,468
Not on your terms. Bring in the
girl. Now we will have two hostages.

27
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:32,386
Well what good will that do? You are buried alive in the heart of this
glacier. Time is desperately short! You've got no time to bargain over hostages.

28
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:44,070
Inside our spaceship, we are safe. And with you here,
your base will dare not use their secret weapon against us.

29
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:49,074
Weapon? But, but the
ioniser is not a weapon!

30
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:50,617
You know how it works?

31
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:54,490
Yes of course! It'll melt
the ice and set you free!

32
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:56,889
You're hurting me!

33
00:03:57,061 --> 00:03:58,030
Victoria!

34
00:03:58,224 --> 00:03:59,108
Oh Doctor!

35
00:03:59,361 --> 00:04:01,005
Victoria.

36
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:04,457
Oh dear but they've got you too.

37
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:06,880
It's alright. We are not beaten yet.

38
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:08,370
Jamie...

39
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:09,662
He's alive!

40
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:16,052
If what you say is true, why
have you not freed us before?

41
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:20,219
Well, there are difficulties.

42
00:04:20,437 --> 00:04:21,722
What are they?

43
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,507
Well...

44
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:26,282
You will tell us.

45
00:05:04,282 --> 00:05:10,613
...Well it's not... it's
not much farther now, lad.

46
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:12,018
How far are we?

47
00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:16,473
Well, we're at the edge of the
woods fringing the camp perimeter.

48
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:18,070
Can we not rest a while?

49
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:22,111
I think so
- but a couple of minutes, no more.

50
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:24,424
Aye, you're right. The
Doctor needs help right away.

51
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:26,562
I wasn't thinking only of the Doctor.

52
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:30,602
Wolves!

53
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:36,546
Yes. Here we're more or less safe,
but the last stretch is open country.

54
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,495
I don't help much, do I?

55
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:44,686
Well I'm not exactly a man of action
myself. Storr should be here now, I miss him.

56
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:45,745
Have you no weapons?

57
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:48,323
Arden's tranquiliser gun, that's all.

58
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:49,663
Aye, it's not much.

59
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:53,607
Storr was a huntsman. An
expert with a bow and arrow.

60
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:54,944
Uhh, it's no good wishing.

61
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:56,970
Well, I'd better carry on.

62
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,245
Aye, lead on McDuff.

63
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:07,827
Keep very still.

64
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:22,281
So, you are afraid of us?

65
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:29,068
No, but of your ship. If the ioniser sets off a
nuclear holocaust, it will all have be in vain.

66
00:06:30,354 --> 00:06:36,762
That is good. In that
case you dare not act.

67
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:43,226
But if you thought there
would be no explosion?

68
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:46,319
Well?

69
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:49,490
Well in that case we'd
have... we'd have no choice.

70
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:52,989
You would use the ioniser.

71
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:55,457
But it wouldn't harm the
ship, it would release it!

72
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:57,631
There would be floods.

73
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,817
Our engines would be useless.

74
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,310
We would be at your mercy.

75
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,352
Why did you come here?

76
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,575
To spy? To betray us?

77
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,230
But you could not hope to
escape to tell the tale.

78
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:17,795
Oh, I always live in hope.

79
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:23,903
You have some kind of communicator.

80
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:27,889
You do realise, don't you, that
after a certain point, my base will...

81
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:31,115
...have to activate the ioniser
regardless of the consequences?

82
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:35,007
And destroy you and themselves as well?

83
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:36,916
Is that what would happen?

84
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:39,553
Give it to me.

85
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:46,180
Ah, they would never know.

86
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:50,645
They would never know.

87
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:58,430
The Doctor. You heard what he said.

88
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:07,070
Regardless of the consequences. Yes.
Yes, he's telling us to take the risk.

89
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:11,681
But we can't give the computer the
information it needs. It can't instruct us.

90
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,972
Can the ioniser hold?

91
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:22,662
Present power it's... steadily losing
ground. But we dare not increase!

92
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:43,497
Summary of orders to all World loniser Stations: The new equation originated from Brittanicus Base will be adopted to conditions prevailing in each
sector. All bases will prepare to use full ioniser attack on the ice in concerted action. Zero hour in six hours exactly. Report readiness one hour.

93
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:47,936
We can't do it.

94
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,676
But if we don't the
whole plan must fail.

95
00:08:50,854 --> 00:09:00,888
But if we act and there is an explosion... apart from
destroying this base, the contamination could easily...

96
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:03,712
We must state our problem
to World Control, now.

97
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:11,346
No wait! We'll give our computer
all the information we have.

98
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:12,494
It isn't enough!

99
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:15,553
It may be. Er, it may be.

100
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:17,236
I know what the computer will say.

101
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:19,737
No no no no no. Let the
computer speak for itself.

102
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:21,524
There's only one answer it can give!

103
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,282
Come on, quickly. Put the
situation to the computer.

104
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,836
Do as you're told!

105
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:30,934
He's sizing us up.

106
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:32,224
Can you not run for it?

107
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,888
I don't intend to leave you here as...

108
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:36,951
Well the gun! Use the gun!

109
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:40,536
I could hit the side of the mountain.
I'm a scientist, not a gladiator.

110
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,019
Well at least you can try!

111
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:47,129
Alright. Cross your fingers. Here goes.

112
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:55,715
Quick get me out of here, I'll tackle him! Get
a hold of yourself man! Quick, he's nearly on us!

113
00:09:57,258 --> 00:10:07,175
Set up all circuits to new equation. And wait. Further information essential
before decision can be taken. Prepare to notify World Control in event of emergency.

114
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:16,971
Of course, the computer's right. We
must be prepared. And we must wait.

115
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:20,561
It is the answer I expected.

116
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:27,134
But you don't realise why
it made this choice, do you?

117
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,199
Because it is the most logical
answer in the circumstances.

118
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:37,379
Of course. And because it's so logical,
it can't gamble, it can't take risks.

119
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:41,696
That is its function. To be totally
impartial. To serve the community.

120
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:48,401
Exactly. And one more aim
in its life: to survive.

121
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,446
It has given us its decision.

122
00:10:54,654 --> 00:11:00,678
It is no decision. The
computer is playing for time.

123
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:18,448
Now listen! All of you! We risk destruction either by a
radioactive explosion, or, by the slow grind of the glaciers.

124
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:29,305
Now there you see that the ice has
advanced 100 metres today. Now either way...

125
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:31,525
The computer is destroyed.

126
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:39,830
So that, by demanding a decision,
we are asking it to commit suicide.

127
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:41,356
It can't do that!

128
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:44,826
Then what is the answer?

129
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:50,152
We can escape. There's
still time to evacuate.

130
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:55,291
Perhaps you could face
world opinionata. I couldn't.

131
00:11:56,536 --> 00:12:00,247
You must notify World Control eventually.
The other bases will be waiting.

132
00:12:00,396 --> 00:12:10,481
I will decide exactly when. For now we do as the computer says. Prepare
the ioniser, and wait. Now, complete data check please, Miss Garrett.

133
00:12:15,724 --> 00:12:28,100
Miss Curtis, report to me the moment _ four
reaches one-five-oh-oh. One-three-seven-nine, now.

134
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:41,747
Well, what do you feel about all this Walters? Bet you didn't think you'd have ice
monsters and things like that to deal with when you volunteered for the job, did you?

135
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,110
Well, did you?

136
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:50,460
I didn't volunteer.

137
00:12:50,947 --> 00:12:54,726
Ah, yes, well... good man, anyway.

138
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:57,023
Penley! Penley, are you alright!

139
00:12:57,322 --> 00:12:58,235
I'll get up...

140
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,959
You sure you're alright?

141
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,558
Well he's clawed me, that's all.

142
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:05,272
Now we better get away quick. He won't
be any friendlier when he wakes up!

143
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:15,907
Close engine room. Well?

144
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:22,086
It's an ion reactor, isn't it? Hmm. It could be
dangerous, but it wouldn't necessarily explode.

145
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:26,693
True. But your friends do not know that.

146
00:13:27,063 --> 00:13:29,046
Now why don't you let us help you?

147
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:34,823
We can get what we
want without your help.

148
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:39,257
But, but what else do you need,
apart from escaping from the ice?

149
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:47,707
We have had enough of your questions.
Now you will give me answers.

150
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:49,904
Well, I've told you all
I can about the ioniser.

151
00:13:50,105 --> 00:13:56,911
That is only a toy. The base
- what is its power source?

152
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,646
Why on earth do you want to know that?

153
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,730
Answer.

154
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:03,391
Oh, so that's what you need is it?

155
00:14:03,564 --> 00:14:05,578
Answer the Commander's questions.

156
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:11,573
Fuel! Fuel for your reactor!
And suppose I don't tell you?

157
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:15,354
The girl dies, now.

158
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:19,702
Doctor, don't tell them!

159
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:27,248
Yes, you'll find what
you need at the base.

160
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:30,549
You shouldn't have!

161
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:34,652
But you, you won't find Leader Clent easy
to persuade. He's a very obstinate man!

162
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:38,286
He will listen to our sonic cannon.

163
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:41,940
We must act quickly, Commander.

164
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:52,077
Isbur and Rintan, wait for me at the entrance
to the cave. Zondal, you will man the sonic gun.

165
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:59,087
You won't succeed! You
can't be so inhuman.

166
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:05,209
We only fight to win.

167
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,384
lon density reading at 1000?

168
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:19,488
74 _.

169
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:20,597
2000?

170
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:22,164
62 _.

171
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:23,481
3000?

172
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,198
43.3 _.

173
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:26,721
4000?

174
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:28,033
39 _.

175
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,373
5000?

176
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:30,438
35 _.

177
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:41,455
Reception check-point to Leader Clent.

178
00:15:41,603 --> 00:15:42,421
Yes, what is it?

179
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:43,345
Two new arrivals, Sir.

180
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:44,705
Well I don't wish to
be disturbed by trifles!

181
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,722
These aren't scavengers Sir. It's the lad
that came with the Doctor and Scientist Penley.

182
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,181
What?

183
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:54,872
Clent, I must talk to you.
I have news of the Doctor.

184
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:57,104
Walters!

185
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,388
Bring the arrivals to me at once.

186
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:02,217
Sir.

187
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,357
Density compensator setting, please.

188
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:17,887
Density compensator setting: zero-three-nine.
Seven-seven-seven. Zero-one. Sequence ends.

189
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:24,231
Take all systems up to this level. Everything
seems to be proceeding satisfactorily.

190
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:25,563
Is it?

191
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,087
What's wrong?

192
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:31,438
Penley's come back.

193
00:16:32,413 --> 00:16:33,411
Of his own choice?

194
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,332
Apparently.

195
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:37,715
Why?

196
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:42,816
We shall soon see. If he
tries to start any trouble...

197
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:45,753
Well, he can't be allowed to interfere
with the program. Not at this stage.

198
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:58,430
No. I no longer need to be tolerant with him. 'Cause he's no longer my equal
- he's an outsider.

199
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:00,767
Come on then.

200
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:02,479
Put him over here.

201
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:03,328
Take it easy.

202
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:05,574
Rest on that Jamie.

203
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:06,410
Thank you.

204
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:07,436
Alright there, lad?

205
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:08,350
Thank you.

206
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:10,807
No stay, Walters. You may be needed.

207
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,720
I'm not liable to be violent.

208
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:15,711
What do you want?

209
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:18,241
Well I brought this lad. He's in
desperate need of medical supervision.

210
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:20,183
We are not a first-aid center.

211
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,427
He's paralysed.

212
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,142
How did it happen?

213
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,034
He was shot down by the warriors' guns.

214
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:32,293
Well thank heavens. Their
weapons don't deal fatal blows.

215
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:33,829
Well they killed Arden.

216
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:36,767
Look you've got to help.

217
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,935
Er, yes of course boy. Um, Walters will
take you to the Medi-Control Centre.

218
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:47,812
No I didn't mean me, I meant Victoria and the Doctor! Look,
they're inside the alien spaceship! You've got to help them.

219
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:49,058
That isn't possible.

220
00:17:49,245 --> 00:17:50,735
Well why not? You've
got to do something!

221
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:56,100
No, we lost contact with the Doctor over
an hour ago. I'm afraid there's no hope.

222
00:17:56,664 --> 00:18:06,430
You mean hope happens to be inconvenient! You've got to stick to your precious schedule, is that it?
You've got to wave your splendid ioniser about to prove that it works and never mind about human beings!

223
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:08,008
The computer has decided!

224
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:13,271
The compu... Override it! Let the ioniser wait. The computer
isn't gonna fall apart because it has to mark time for an hour!

225
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,698
We are marking time. We're not using the ioniser
under instructions from the computer itself.

226
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:17,595
Why?

227
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:22,569
The spaceship may contain a reactor system that could
wipe us off this island if we cause it to explode.

228
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:23,948
So what are you gonna do?

229
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,498
We obey the computer. We will wait.

230
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:32,690
Wait? But that's suicide! The
glacier's practically on top of us!

231
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:38,261
We still have time in hand.

232
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:39,637
Yes, but if the Doctor, if he's...

233
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:40,276
No.

234
00:18:40,426 --> 00:18:42,637
If the Doctor doesn't contact
you, what hope is there?

235
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:43,437
There is hope.

236
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:48,136
Oh don't be a fool, Clent! You're not
a man, you're just a machine's slave.

237
00:18:51,052 --> 00:19:17,951
Don't you spit your stupid liberty in my face, Penley. We know your kind of freedom - freedom to run away - from
responsibilities, from service, from moral judgement. I may be a physical coward, Penley, you're a coward in the mind.

238
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:25,776
Well at least I have a mind and not a _ junction box. I would act, but you
daren't. And so you're going to be destroyed, along with your mechanical master.

239
00:19:25,976 --> 00:19:27,185
Look, you've got to help us man.

240
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:28,222
Jamie, I don't think you're...

241
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:29,378
Jamie, take it easy.

242
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,268
Ahh! Now, get them out of here!

243
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:48,639
You'd better take them to the Medi-Control Centre. Get someone to
look at the boy. Make sure there's a guard for when they come to.

244
00:19:48,993 --> 00:19:53,874
Right. Get two guards to control.

245
00:19:56,719 --> 00:20:01,553
Penley
- he's nothing!

246
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:10,575
Our trust is in the great computer.
With its aid, we cannot fail.

247
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:18,431
They are now outside their base.

248
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:26,402
Stand by, gun control.
Take target readings.

249
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:37,867
Ready.

250
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,622
Vertical bearing: minus point nine.

251
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:52,324
Lateral bearing: three-five.

252
00:20:56,514 --> 00:21:03,973
Prepare to charge to
frequency three-five.

253
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:12,184
Frequency three-five.

254
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:29,436
It's all right Victoria, don't cry.

255
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:32,589
It's alright. There's
nothing to be afraid of.

256
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:45,249
But if Varga Rintan is triumphant,
then you will have cause to cry.

257
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:48,364
Come along, Victoria, blow. Blow.

258
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:52,056
That's better, that's better.

259
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:54,881
We can try and escape with this.

260
00:21:55,145 --> 00:21:55,928
What is it?

261
00:21:56,206 --> 00:21:58,817
Ammonium sulphide.

262
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,298
Ammonium sulphide?
It's only a stink bomb.

263
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:07,562
Yes, you've had the benefits of a classical
education. Yes, it is what you'd call a stink bomb.

264
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:09,092
What use is that?

265
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:14,171
You'd be surprised. Harmless to humans,
but to aliens very possibly deadly!

266
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:19,247
The gun is now ready, Commander.

267
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:32,629
Good Zondal. We will now contact the scientists.
On my command you will fire once. Do you understand?

268
00:22:33,804 --> 00:22:36,833
Yes, Commander.

269
00:22:37,112 --> 00:22:38,335
Good.

270
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:40,483
Zondal! Zondal, look!

271
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:41,728
What is it?

272
00:22:41,947 --> 00:22:42,519
Look!

273
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:45,145
Do not try any tricks.

274
00:22:45,471 --> 00:22:48,321
There's, there's water, seeping
into the ship. Just there.

275
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:51,690
Er, over in the corner there.

276
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:57,436
You tricked me. There is no water.

277
00:22:58,198 --> 00:23:04,199
What is that? Let me have
it. Give it to me at once.

278
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:08,569
Zondal! Zondal fire!

279
00:23:09,437 --> 00:23:22,468
Fire now! Zondal fire!
Zondal fire! Fire now!
