00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:04,296
VICTORIA: Jamie!

2
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:21,433
CLENT: He took just forty five seconds to propose ionisation. No prior knowledge.
他仅仅用了45秒就提出了离子化的建议, 没有任何背景了解。

3
00:01:21,724 --> 00:01:24,003
ARDEN: Well, it took us and the Academy of Scientists years.
啊, 当初可花了我们科学院好几年的时间。

4
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:27,014
GARRETT: The computer took three milliseconds.
电脑用了三毫秒

5
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:28,795
ARDEN: Yes, well, we had to programme it first.
是的, 但我们需要先编程

6
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:34,525
CLENT: Quite. Well, before I make a final decision, I want the computer's assessment on this Doctor.
的确是。在我作最后决定之前, 我想让电脑对博士做一个评估。

7
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:36,454
GARRETT: We must be absolutely sure.
这事我们绝对不能搞错

8
00:01:38,385 --> 00:01:41,005
CLENT: State the work potential and community value of the Doctor.
请评估博士的工作潜力和社区价值

9
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:47,537
COMPUTER: More information is necessary for a full evaluation. High IQ but undisciplined for our needs.
需要更多信息才能做出完整的评估。智商很高, 但不守纪律, 所以不满足我们的需要。

10
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:52,537
Present evaluation, to be used on research projects, but could be obstructive in certain situations.
当前评估：可用于研究项目,但在特定场景下可能造成阻碍

11
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:53,446
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are.
哦, 你在这儿啊

12
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:54,117
CLENT: Doctor, would you mind
博士, 你介意吗

13
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:55,897
DOCTOR: I've been looking everywhere. Why don't you label your doors?
我到处找了个遍, 你们为什么不在门上贴标识呢

14
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:57,597
CLENT: Yes, this is a private meeting.
是的, 这是一个内部会议

15
00:01:57,656 --> 00:01:58,846
DOCTOR: Yes, I realise that, and I'm sorry.
哦, 我意识到了, 不好意思

16
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:00,767
CLENT: And we have not yet completed our business.
我们还没有完成我们的工作

17
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:07,529
DOCTOR: Look, I wouldn't intrude if I didn't think it necessary. What I have to say is extremely important. After all, you did ask me to help you, didn't you?
你看, 如果我觉得没这个必要的话我是不会干涉的。但我要说的非常重要。毕竟, 你的确说过让我帮助你们, 说过吧？

18
00:02:07,617 --> 00:02:08,557
ARDEN: Has something happened to the warrior?
勇士那边发生了什么吗？

19
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:09,696
DOCTOR: Well, it has something to do with that, yes.
嗯, 跟那个相关, 是的

20
00:02:09,736 --> 00:02:11,576
CLENT: We have more serious matters on hand.
我们手头有更正经的事情

21
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:12,387
DOCTOR: This is serious!
这事很正经！

00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,756
ARDEN: Now let him tell us, Clent. Well?
让他说吧, Clent, 怎样?

23
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:18,858
DOCTOR: Thank you. It's the, it's the helmet. It's not what we thought it was.
谢谢你。就是, 就是那个头盔, 并不是我们之前想的那样

24
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:21,498
CLENT: It's a prehistoric drinking cup.
那就是个史前的饮水杯子

25
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:25,226
DOCTOR: No! It has electronic connections.
不！上面有电子链接

26
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:30,017
CLENT: E? What are you talking about?
呃？你在说些什么啊？

27
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,278
ARDEN: But that's impossible. You must be mistaken.
那是不可能的, 你一定搞错了

28
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:35,438
DOCTOR: No, I'm positive. You realise what this means?
不, 我很确定。你知道这意味着什么吗？

29
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:39,637
ARDEN: Well it must mean the civilisation he came from must be more advanced than we thought.
这肯定意味着他来自一个先进的文明, 比我们之前想的要先进得多

30
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,160
DOCTOR: Yes, indeed. They even had astronauts, it appears.
是的, 的确。看起来他们甚至有宇航员

31
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:44,419
CLENT: How do you mean?
这什么意思？

32
00:02:44,638 --> 00:02:50,489
DOCTOR: This headpiece is no warriors tin-hat. It's a highly sophisticated space helmet!
这个头套可不是勇士的帽子, 它是一个非常复杂的宇航头盔！

33
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:54,967
CLENT: Aren't you jumping to conclusions, Doctor, for a scientist?
你这太跳跃了吧？博士, 作为一个科学家...

34
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:56,418
ARDEN: But if this is true?
但如果这是真的呢？

35
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:58,777
DOCTOR: If this is true your project is in danger.
如果这是真的, 你们的项目就危险了

36
00:02:58,907 --> 00:03:02,448
CLENT: In what way? How can one preserved body, however old, effect us?
怎么说？一具这么古老的尸体, 怎么能影响我们？

37
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:07,358
DOCTOR: How did he get here? Well, he didn't walk, did he?
他怎么到这里来的？你看, 他不是走来的, 对吧？

38
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,298
CLENT: Well, if what you say is true, by spaceship.
好, 如果你说的是对的, 是坐飞船来的。

39
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,018
DOCTOR: Yes, and where is that spaceship now?
是的, 飞船现在在什么地方？

40
00:03:11,048 --> 00:03:20,038
ARDEN: In the glacier. Then it must still be intact. He had no signs of mutilation. He couldn't have crashed. He must of landed. Clent, can't you see the importance of such a discovery?
在冰川里面。估计还是完整的。他的身体没有损坏的痕迹, 所以不应该是坠毁的, 而是正常着陆的。Clent, 你看出来没, 我们有了个重大发现？

41
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,332
CLENT: The propulsion unit of the spacecraft is probably
飞船的推进装置很可能是...

42
00:03:23,392 --> 00:03:24,773
GARRETT: Probably atomic powered.
很可能是靠原子能驱动的

43
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:30,063
CLENT: Quite. And, er, if we use the ioniser at full power
很可能。如果我们把离子器功率开到最大

44
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:33,543
DOCTOR: This reactor pile could be exploded or be activated.
反应堆就可能爆炸, 至少也是激活了

45
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:34,005
CLENT: But if we don't
但如果我们没有...

46
00:03:34,065 --> 00:03:35,357
GARRETT: The whole area will be contaminated.
这整个地方都将会被污染

47
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:41,379
CLENT: But if we don't use the ioniser, what then? We are part of a world plan. Now, if we hold back that plan cannot go into operation.
但如果我们不用离子器, 又会怎样？我们是现在是世界级计划的一部分, 如果我们按兵不动整个计划就无法继续了

48
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:43,759
GARRETT: We could hold it at minimal power.
我们可以用最小动力

49
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:44,578
CLENT: Not good enough.
这个方法不够好

50
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:48,588
ARDEN: No, we daren't take the risk. The contamination level would last for five decades or more.
不, 我们承担不了这个风险。核污染可能会影响50年以上

51
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:51,130
CLENT: It merely makes the fine control of the heat level even more vital.
只不过需要需要精心控制好热度, 不超过危险阈值就是了(FIXME)

52
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:53,228
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I thought you ought to know.
是的, 我想你们也应该知道

53
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:57,937
CLENT: Yes, you were right, thank you. I must inform the computer immediately for its decision.
是的, 你是对的, 谢谢你。我得立即找电脑询问该做怎样的决定

54
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,099
ARDEN: Well, we shall need more facts.
不过, 我们应该有更多的证据

55
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,199

就是, 我们那时正在说话, 一转头, 他就正站在我们旁边

67
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:28,248
ARDEN: That's impossible. To be preserved, yes, but to come alive? Impossible.
那不可能。尸身保持完整, 这可能。但复活？不可能

68
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:29,677

DOCTOR: Oh good.
好

137
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:37,385
CLENT: But you must leave immediately, because the sooner we know whether there is a reactor buried inside that glacier or not, the better.
你们得立即出发, 因为越早了解到情况越好, 到底是不是在冰川里面是否埋着一个反应堆

138
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:40,293
JAMIE: Aye, maybe, but Victoria's important too, you know.
是啊, 有可能。但Victoria也很重要, 你知道的

139

你看来还没有明白, 孩子, 这世界的命运已经危在旦夕了。那个女孩就看她自己的造化了

你打算做什么？弄残我？

144
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:08,029

是的, 我觉得你会的。但如果你不按我说的去做, 你很快就会陷入昏迷, 倒可以让我安静一会儿

153

STORR: Ach.

PENLEY: Well, there are advantages to living in a plant museum, even this close to the glacier.
嗯, 住在一个行星博物馆还是有好处的, 虽然离冰川太近了点

162
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:18,620
STORR: Ah, so even a scientist can appreciate it then?
哈, 一个科学及也懂得欣赏这个了？

163
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:30,111

你能从树上摘水果。但现在你们这些烂科学家就... (FIXME)

我已经学了不少了, 足够自己照顾自己。我是去给你个蠢人弄点东西

00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:37,075
PENLEY: I'm going for drugs. And if I don't get them, you're as good as dead.
我只是去弄点药。如果我不弄来, 你就死翘翘了。

177
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:44,455
VICTORIA: It's, it's, it's, it's a

VARGA: Go on.

你将带我去那里, 没有能量设备的话, 我的勇士们就是死的

VARGA: If you call for help.
如果你呼救的话。

187
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,032
VICTORIA: What is that?
那是什么？

188
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:52,833
VARGA: Sonic gun. It will burst your brain with noise.
音速枪。它会用噪音爆掉你的脑袋

189
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,372
JAMIE: There's no one been here. There's not a mark.
这里没有人, 一点痕迹也没有

00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:02,032

我们在路上也没有碰到过。现在, 站一边去好吗, 小伙子

191
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:09,618
JAMIE: We were wrong, then. He's lost out there somewhere, Victoria with him.
我们搞错了, 他肯定在哪里迷路了, 带着 victoria

192
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:21,663
ARDEN: I can't get a reading. There's something inside there, but all it's doing is creating havoc with this radiation sensor.
没有任何读数, 这里面有什么东西在干扰辐射检测仪。

那不是你们任务的目的, 请按任务报告情况

197

带着这些设备没法进去

JAMIE: A nice boss you've got there.
你有个不错的老板

206
00:14:12,414 --> 00:14:20,353
ARDEN: Yes. The trouble with Clent is that he's not a proper scientist, he's an organiser. He should've been born a robot.
Clent的麻烦是他不是一个科学家, 他是个管理者。他可能生下来就是个机器人

CLENT: Good...Well?
好...怎样?

217

这是我经历过的最重要的任务。我经手过的其它项目都很容易, 没有任何失败。之所以选我来, 就是我从来没有失败过。

I was chosen because I never fail. When I handpicked the team, I made one vital mistake.
但我在挑选团队成员的时候, 我犯了一个重大的错误

219
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:25,236
DOCTOR: This chap Penley.
Penley那个家伙

220
00:16:26,588 --> 00:16:31,267
CLENT: Best man in Europe for ionisation studies. As it turned out, hopelessly temperamental.
欧洲离子化研究的第一人。但到头来, 很情绪化, 让人失望

221
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:37,582
DOCTOR: Temperamental or individual? Creative scientists have to be allowed some head you know.
情绪化还是有个性？对有创造力的科学家得宽容一点, 是吧

222
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:44,422
CLENT: Creative? Poppycock. When he walked out of here he proclaimed himself to be criminally, criminally irresponsible.
有创造力？胡说, 他从这里走出去的时候他就宣称他不再承担任何责任(FIXME)

223
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:46,833
DOCTOR: It couldn't have been just a simple gesture of protest?
可能只是简单地表示抗议吧？

224
00:16:46,944 --> 00:16:52,284
CLENT: He was always protesting. This is a team, a team with a mission. If we fail, others cannot succeed.
他总是在抗议。这是一个团队, 有任务目标的团队。如果我们失败, 其它人也不能成功

225
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:54,704
DOCTOR: And your name will suffer. That's important.
然后你的名声就坏了, 这很重要

226
00:16:54,793 --> 00:17:02,174
CLENT: I lead the team. I depend on the experts I picked. My judgement was sound. Others won't see it that way.
我带领这个团队, 我依赖于这些我挑出来的专家, 我相信我的判断。其他人可能不会这样看

227
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:03,654
DOCTOR: So you do need Penley.
所以你需要 Penley

228
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:12,534
CLENT: No, I do not need Penley. But I do need an equivalent brain. But it would be months before anyone else could pick up the knowledge that Penley acquired here.
不, 我不需要 Penley, 但我需要一个与他相当的大脑。不过仅仅是捡起Penley在这里了解到的那些情况就需要好几个月

229
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:14,734
Just isn't time, that's the pertinent issue.
现在不是时候, 这是最要命的问题

230
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:21,113
DOCTOR: Well, I'll try and help you, but I do think you might try trusting human beings instead of computers.
这样, 我会尽量帮你。但我真的觉得你应该试着相信这些人, 而不是电脑

231
00:17:21,203 --> 00:17:28,973
CLENT: I trust no one, Doctor. Not any more. Human emotions are unreliable.
我谁也不信, 博士。不再信了。人的情感太不可靠的了。

232
00:17:29,203 --> 00:17:36,973
I'll just go and see that the working area reserved for you in the Medi-Control Centre is ready.
我现在去看看媒体控制中心那边给你准备的工作区是否准备好了

你得跟我来, 到冰山去

237
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:25,711

不, 求你了

238
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:34,394

我, 呃, 我正打算把这个给他

242
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:22,787
DOCTOR: Oh, that's disgusting. It's just the thing. Did you do this?
哦, 这很难闻。正是这个。这是你干的吗？

243
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:26,967
PENLEY: I've come very close to it at times. I've never seen him look so peaceful.
事情发生的时候我离得不远, 我倒从来没见过他这么平和

244
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:30,576
DOCTOR: Oh, he'll be all right. Did you see who did do it?
哦, 他会没事的。你看到是谁干的了吗？

245
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:34,397
PENLEY: Yes. A monstrous looking creature. I didn't like the look of him at all.
是的, 一个怪物一样的家伙, 我一点也不喜欢他的样子

246
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,768
DOCTOR: Was there a girl there?
是不是还有一个女孩？

247
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:37,649
PENLEY: Yes, she seemed scared stiff.
是的, 她看来了吓坏了

248
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:39,027
DOCTOR: Well, why didn't you try and stop them?
那你怎么不试着阻止他们？

249
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:42,707
PENLEY: Well, I came here to get some drugs for a man who is sick. I couldn't run the risk of getting caught.
