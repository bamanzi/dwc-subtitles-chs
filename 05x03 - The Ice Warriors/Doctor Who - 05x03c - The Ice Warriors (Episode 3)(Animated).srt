1
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:30,224
VARGA: See, it is working. Zondal is coming to life. Zondal. Zondal. Zondal.

2
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:38,843
JAMIE: Wish me luck, Doctor.

3
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:45,440
DOCTOR: You take care of yourself, Jamie, and keep an eye on Arden. I don't think he quite realises how dangerous this creature is.

4
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:47,689
JAMIE: After what's happened here? He must be blind.

5
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:51,240
DOCTOR: Well, he's a scientist and a bit inclined to have his head in the air. You know what they're like.

6
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,750
JAMIE: Aye, I certainly do.

7
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,390
ARDEN: Are you all ready, lad?

8
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,461
JAMIE: Aye, let's away.

9
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,180
DOCTOR: Good luck.

10
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,781
ARDEN: Now we don't know how many of them there are, so we'll have to tread carefully.

11
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:03,159
CLENT: You will not expose yourself to any unnecessary violence, Arden?

12
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:14,841
ARDEN: Now listen, Clent, we both know that I'm responsible for what has happened. If I hadn't brought that creature back here in the first place, none of this would have occurred. I also caused the death of Davis. I can't forget that, either.

13
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:22,217
CLENT: Well, you just remember your mission, that's all. And no wild sorties after the girl. It's vital that you get your information back to us immediately.

14
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:26,489
JAMIE: Look, we'll not leave Victoria to the warriors, if that's what you mean. If there's half a chance of us two

15
00:02:26,558 --> 00:02:32,099
CLENT: You will take your orders from Scientist Arden! Act according to your priorities, Arden.

16
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,089
ARDEN: Come along, boy.

17
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:33,989
CLENT: Arden?

18
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:34,589
ARDEN: Yes?

19
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:56,825
CLENT: Don't be to too hard on yourself. Scientists must question, you know. I mean, if I'd been in your shoes I think I'd have done the same. I'd have, I'd have brought it back. So, anyway, good luck.

20
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:58,676
DOCTOR: Good luck, Jamie!

21
00:02:58,676 --> 00:02:59,267
JAMIE: And you, Doctor.

22
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:04,393
CLENT: Well, Doctor, let's see you go into action. I'll just get Miss Garrett to take you over the set-up here.

23
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:09,261
DOCTOR: Miss Garrett? Oh, no, no. There's no need to go into formalities.

24
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:13,363
CLENT: Miss Garrett? I like things done properly. Where is she?

25
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:19,841
DOCTOR: Now Clent, just remember I am not a member of your staff. I'm just a working guest, as you might say.

26
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:22,673
CLENT: Yes, of course. But this is a formal establishment, and our regulations

27
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:27,543
DOCTOR: Your regulations do not apply to me. I work in my own way, freely.

28
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:35,883
CLENT: I see. Like Penley. Regulations seemed to bother him, too. Probably caused his eventual breakdown, in fact.

29
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:38,353
DOCTOR: Breakdown? I thought you said he defected?

30
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:47,363
CLENT: Did I? Well, one thing lead to another, naturally. He was under a great deal of pressure. Just too much for him, that's all.

31
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,903
DOCTOR: Oh, I see.

32
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:54,093
STORR: A creature growing out of the ice! Bah!

33
00:03:54,262 --> 00:03:57,864
PENLEY: I assure you that what I saw was very real. And terrifying.

34
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:04,004
STORR: You've been out on the mountain too long. It takes some people that way. Especially the brainy ones.

35
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:07,613
PENLEY: Hmmm. Very well, don't believe me, but I still intend to find out.

36
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:13,844
STORR: Ah well, you can leave me out of your fun and games. I've got enough troubles of my own.

37
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:18,494
PENLEY: You're fit enough now. To do the cooking, at least. Thanks to science.

38
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:31,554
STORR: Science! Och, it wasn't science, it was just good plain doctoring. And if you smirk again like that, I'll crack your head open with this.

39
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:36,236
PENLEY: Yes, you're definitely back to your normal witty self. What's the matter?

40
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:38,511
STORR: Someone's outside.

41
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:52,344
PENLEY: They must have tracked me here from the base. Hide yourself. We don't want you carted off to Africa yet. You!

42
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:57,564
GARRETT: I followed you. It's all right, I'm alone.

43
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:00,857
PENLEY: What do you want?

44
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:06,247
GARRETT: Elric, we're in desperate trouble at the base. You're the only one who can help us.

45
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:09,858
PENLEY: Clent doesn't need me. All he wants is a mirror. Preferably rose-tinted.

46
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:13,180
GARRETT: He does need you to make the ioniser work again.

47
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:15,340
PENLEY: Is that all?

48
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:20,838
GARRETT: No. He's faced with having to report the full situation to World Control.

49
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:25,908
PENLEY: Oh well, now we're coming to it, aren't we? The great Clent would have to admit failure. That's it, isn't it? Poor old Clent. He never could face the music. Here, what about this creature at the glacier?

50
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,997
GARRETT: That's only part of our trouble. The real problem is the ioniser. Will you come?

51
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,051
PENLEY: It's typical of him to send you, instead of armed guards.

52
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:52,109
GARRETT: He doesn't know I'm here. I'm asking you.

53
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:54,779
PENLEY: I won't come.

54
00:05:55,749 --> 00:06:04,109
GARRETT: But you can't just step aside. A man like you, living like a scavenger? It's utterly wrong. Civilisation needs you.

55
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:18,910
PENLEY: Jane, I chose this existence. I chose it because I refuse to be sucked into that computerised ant-heap you call a civilisation. I'm a man, not a machine. I will not return.

56
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:20,719
GARRETT: Not even to save the world?

57
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:50,255
PENLEY: Save the world? Well, that has a fine Clentian ring to it. No thanks, no. It'll take more than me to do that. But don't you worry, you don't get rid of my sort all that easily. Machines corrode and rust, but mankind goes on. You'll find Clent one of these days in a museum, like that ancient stove, with an inscription round him. Robotised human mark two, now extinct. But you'll find others like me still alive.

58
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:54,786
GARRETT: Surely, Elric, that's all the more reason to come back. To change things.

59
00:06:54,786 --> 00:07:14,073
PENLEY: Don't you understand, Jane? Clent's just a talker. He's a glib political animal. Even if I did change things, the Clent's of this world would still come out on top. Running things according to their own whims and indulgences. And the pity of it is, they believe they're right.

60
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:19,632
GARRETT: Then you leave me no alternative. You will come, and now!

61
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:27,350
PENLEY: You must be desperate. But tranquillising me isn't going to make it any easier. You'd never be able to carry me all that way.

62
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,352
STORR: Oh no you don't!

63
00:07:28,392 --> 00:07:29,482
GARRETT: Who's this?

64
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:31,974
PENLEY: Just a friend. Now what are you going to do?

65
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:36,577
GARRETT: Return to base and wait for the inevitable disaster.

66
00:07:36,678 --> 00:07:41,917
STORR: Oh no, you don't. I'm not having you set the dogs on me. I'd as soon put an end to her game. Give me that.

67
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:43,387
PENLEY: Storr, no. She won't put us away.

68
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:45,507
GARRETT: No, I won't.

69
00:07:45,727 --> 00:07:47,167
STORR: I don't trust any of them.

70
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:52,756
GARRETT: Please trust me enough to come with me to safety. Apart from the danger of the glacier, these creatures.

71
00:07:52,817 --> 00:08:09,902
PENLEY: Oh yes, your ice warriors. Well, we shall just have to take our chance. No, I won't return. And now you must go. But if Sir Genius does have trouble with the ioniser, look up my notes on the Omega factor.

72
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:13,614
GARRETT: Thank you for that at least.

73
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:19,841
STORR: This ice warrior. It's real then.

74
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:22,682
PENLEY: Oh yes. And I'm going up there again.

75
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:23,871
STORR: But why, man?

76
00:08:24,648 --> 00:08:30,218
PENLEY: Because I must know. Now, put this knife to more sensible use.

77
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:39,374
VARGA: If you value life, obey, and do not anger us.

78
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:42,766
VICTORIA: I want to go back to my friends.

79
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:50,985
VARGA: Perhaps later. For the moment, you are useful to us. Zondal.

80
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,364
ZONDAL: Commander.

81
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:59,166
VARGA: You will locate our buried spaceship without delay.

82
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:02,285
ZONDAL: That will not be difficult.

83
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:08,006
VARGA: You will excavate sufficient space to form a cave.

84
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:10,167
ZONDAL: A cave.

85
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:12,007
VARGA: To act as a trap.

86
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:15,717
VICTORIA: A trap? Who for?

87
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:21,146
VARGA: Do not interfere. Your friends may attack us.

88
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:25,028
VICTORIA: But they don't want to attack you. They could help you.

89
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:27,247
VARGA: We do not need help.

90
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,406
VICTORIA: You'd still be frozen and dead if it wasn't for us.

91
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:32,878
VARGA: You are a child.

92
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,419
VICTORIA: Oh, why won't you listen?

93
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:40,826
VARGA: Commence.

94
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:44,105
VICTORIA: What are you going to do with me?

95
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:51,145
VARGA: Bait. Bait for the trap.

96
00:09:55,355 --> 00:10:05,617
ZONDAL: Activate direction sensors. Steady. Sonic stalls ready. Set to wide impact. Take aim. Continuous fire!

97
00:10:36,280 --> 00:11:08,861
DOCTOR: If I was to reverse the sequence to give a density ratio. Where did I? Yes, here we are. If I reverse the sequence to give a density ratio. Excuse me. Excuse me! Yes.

98
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:15,891
CLENT: Genius at work, I see. Good morning Doctor.

99
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:18,451
DOCTOR: Mmm? Yes.

100
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:23,511
CLENT: Well, this is all very impressive, Doctor, but don't you think it'd be simpler to use a computer?

101
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:25,330
DOCTOR: Four. What computer?

102
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,621
CLENT: The base computer.

103
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:38,912
DOCTOR: Six. Yes, they're useful for digital analysis, but I very rarely use them, except when I have to. There is one thing you could do for me which would be very important.

104
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,192
CLENT: Yes, yes, anything. What is it?

105
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:46,532
DOCTOR: Lend me a pencil. Oh, that would be even better.

106
00:11:47,622 --> 00:11:50,682
CLENT: Doctor, would you mind explaining just what it is that you are

107
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,133
DOCTOR: Now, this is wrong, this is wrong. It's not right. There's something missing.

108
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,604
CLENT: Would these figures help?

109
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:57,782
DOCTOR: Supposing I? What are they?

110
00:11:57,822 --> 00:11:59,163
CLENT: Data readings from the other bases.

111
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:00,413
DOCTOR: Oh, computer checked, I hope?

112
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:01,383
CLENT: Of course.

113
00:12:01,383 --> 00:12:02,634
DOCTOR: Oh, thank heavens for that.

114
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,032
GARRETT: Doctor, I've found something here that I think you might

115
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:07,447
CLENT: Where have you been, Miss Garrett? Your instructions were to help the Doctor, were they not?

116
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:14,379
GARRETT: Yes, Leader Clent. I have been looking up Scientist Penley's notes. These. Could these help?

117
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:47,442
DOCTOR: What are they? Omega. Well, what does he mean? Omega. What does he? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Yes! Yes, of course. The Omega Factor! There and here and there. Yes! Ha ha! Your friend Penley is very clever.

118
00:12:47,512 --> 00:12:48,573
CLENT: Is that it?

119
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:49,633
DOCTOR: Yes, that's it!

120
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:50,834
CLENT: That's fantastic.

121
00:12:50,923 --> 00:12:53,333
DOCTOR: Oh, when you've been at it as long as I have it's nothing.

122
00:12:53,402 --> 00:12:55,723
GARRETT: Do you think it could possibly work?

123
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:56,742
CLENT: It's very possible.

124
00:12:56,787 --> 00:12:59,123
DOCTOR: Possible? It's perfect! Well, it's nearly perfect.

125
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:00,928
CLENT: We shall see.

126
00:13:01,018 --> 00:13:02,177
DOCTOR: Oh, it'll work, all right.

127
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:04,027
CLENT: The computer will confirm that, I'm sure.

128
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,528
DOCTOR: Computer?

129
00:13:05,628 --> 00:13:06,997
GARRETT: Well, everything's checked.

130
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:09,322
DOCTOR: I resent that!

131
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:11,261
CLENT: Just normal practice, Doctor.

132
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:12,981
DOCTOR: It should be the other way round.

133
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:23,856
CLENT: We have to be quite sure. It'll only take a matter of seconds. Copy all this down, Miss Garrett, and then we can feed it through the computer and do a simulator run. I'll just go and set it up.

134
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:27,986
DOCTOR: I shall demand an apology, you know.

135
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:30,561
GARRETT: We may not have time for that.

136
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:33,400
DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad you had time to look up Penley's notes.

137
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:35,271
GARRETT: I thought it might be useful.

138
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:38,413
DOCTOR: Pity that he turned traitor.

139
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:42,894
GARRETT: Oh, Clent might call him that, but he's still the most brilliant scientist we have.

140
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:47,723
DOCTOR: Oh? Oh, it's nice to see he still has some friends in the base.

141
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:57,597
ARDEN: Glacier task unit. Leader Clent, please. Leader Clent, please.

142
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:00,526
CLENT: Clent here. Report.

143
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,647
ARDEN: We've arrived at the glacier site. There's something strange.

144
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:05,476
CLENT: What is?

145
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:09,986
ARDEN: The ice face. It's been excavated into a cave.

146
00:14:10,107 --> 00:14:11,007
DOCTOR: How?

147
00:14:11,076 --> 00:14:12,946
ARDEN: By some kind of tool, I think.

148
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,777
CLENT: Is there any sign of a spacecraft?

149
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:15,937
ARDEN: Yes.

150
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:17,296
DOCTOR: There is? Where?

151
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,718
ARDEN: Well, at the back of the cave, there's what looks like a metal door in the ice.

152
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,491
ARDEN: The place is apparently deserted.

153
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,421
DOCTOR: Well make sure you don't go too near.

154
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,970
CLENT: Excuse me. Take the necessary readings, and leave quickly, Arden.

155
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:37,351
ARDEN: I'll take care.

156
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:40,475
JAMIE: What readings?

157
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:43,415
ARDEN: Radiation, magnetic field and ion density. Won't take long.

158
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:46,267
JAMIE: I don't fancy this place.

159
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:52,326
ARDEN: There's never been such a discovery as this. All my life

160
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:11,586
VICTORIA: No! Oh Jamie, no! What have you done to him? You killed them!

161
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:14,575
VARGA: It was necessary.

162
00:15:14,676 --> 00:15:16,926
VICTORIA: Oh, you're monsters!

163
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:19,005
VARGA: Remove her inside.

164
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:31,110
VICTORIA: Oh, leave me alone! Oh, please. Haven't you done enough? Please, leave me alone! I want to go back! Please!

165
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:41,241
ZONDAL: There may be more of them.

166
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:55,266
VARGA: If more of them come, we will destroy them. If no more of them come, we will know there are not enough of them to resist us.

167
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:58,323
ZONDAL: Let us destroy the girl now.

168
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:06,190
VARGA: They came after her. She is obviously of some value to them.

169
00:16:06,338 --> 00:16:08,848
ZONDAL: Then they will try again.

170
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:31,169
VARGA: We shall be ready for them. But first, Zondal, you have a task to complete. The propulsion unit. It must be made to function. Time is vital. You must succeed.

171
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:32,971
ZONDAL: Yes, Commander.

172
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,982
VARGA: Come.

173
00:17:05,785 --> 00:17:08,535
CLENT: We've just finished programming the computer. We shall have the result very quickly.

174
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:11,096
DOCTOR: Isn't it about time that Arden and Jamie reported again?

175
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:18,154
CLENT: Yes, that's true. But you know what Arden is, with his scientific curiosity.

176
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:19,873
DOCTOR: Yes, very human. I'm worried about them too.

177
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:28,743
CLENT: Yes, I'll do it if you don't mind. Leader Clent calling Scientist Arden. Arden? Do you receive me?

178
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:34,245
DOCTOR: He's not answering. Perhaps something has happened to them.

179
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:39,714
CLENT: It looks as if he's. Arden. For heaven's sake man, come in!

180
00:17:41,254 --> 00:17:56,493
DOCTOR: Jamie, answer me! Jamie, what's happened? Jamie! Jamie!

181
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:21,628
DOCTOR: I will never forgive myself if anything's happened to Jamie.

182
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:23,625
CLENT: What about this project with Arden missing?

183
00:18:23,655 --> 00:18:25,667
DOCTOR: Oh, your ioniser will work all right.

184
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:30,579
CLENT: I hope so. I'm not sure that I trust your judgement yet, Doctor.

185
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:33,016
DOCTOR: What do you mean, I'm only human? Well as a matter of fact

186
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:33,505
GARRETT: It works!

187
00:18:33,555 --> 00:18:33,947
DOCTOR: I told you it would.

188
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:34,346
GARRETT: The equation works!

189
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:35,491
DOCTOR: I told you it would.

190
00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:47,879
CLENT: Good. Good. Jolly good. Success is at last possible. Inform all ioniser bases, Miss Garrett. Thank you, Doctor. It's a triumph.

191
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:54,221
DOCTOR: Very likely. But somewhere, out on that ice face, are two young people for whom I have considerable affection. That is no triumph!

192
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:57,561
CLENT: I appreciate your feelings. I, too, have lost a colleague.

193
00:18:57,632 --> 00:18:59,029
DOCTOR: They're not colleagues, they're friends.

194
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:04,939
CLENT: We cannot be sentimental in this situation, Doctor. Our mission continues. We must all play our part.

195
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,362
DOCTOR: I've played mine. It's finished.

196
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:19,124
CLENT: What a triumph. Europe saved. Science the victor over nature, and it happened in my sector. Well, it's not the first time.

197
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:22,191
GARRETT: Now we can go ahead. It only needs programming.

198
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,662
DOCTOR: Aren't you forgetting something?

199
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:25,520
CLENT: I'm sorry, but some lives are bound to be lost.

200
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:31,292
DOCTOR: No, no, I don't mean that. Arden. He's not yet completed his mission.

201
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:37,461
GARRETT: Oh yes, of course. The spaceship reactor. We daren't proceed until we've heard from Arden.

202
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:42,298
CLENT: Where is he? Where is he? Where is he?

203
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:53,587
STORR: What did you have to bring him back here for? Another mouth to feed.

204
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:56,996
PENLEY: You may hate scientists, Storr, but there's no need to hate all human beings.

205
00:19:57,057 --> 00:19:59,615
STORR: I don't trust anyone from Clent's base.

206
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:03,515
JAMIE: Who are you? Where's Arden? What happened?! Oh, my head.

207
00:20:03,546 --> 00:20:06,666
PENLEY: Now you must rest. You're suffering from severe shock. Now just lie still.

208
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:08,787
JAMIE: Well, where am I?

209
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:11,037
STORR: Ah, never you mind. Somewhere safe.

210
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,107
JAMIE: Well, what happened to me and Arden?

211
00:20:13,137 --> 00:20:16,736
PENLEY: Arden's dead. You were both shot down by the warriors.

212
00:20:16,797 --> 00:20:18,217
JAMIE: Arden dead?

213
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:20,247
PENLEY: They used some sort of ray gun.

214
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:22,187
JAMIE: So we failed.

215
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:25,600
STORR: You came to rescue the girl? Is that it?

216
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,338
JAMIE: You've seen Victoria? Is she still alive?

217
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:28,378
PENLEY: Yes, she is alive.

218
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:29,908
JAMIE: Then we can still save her! You will help me, please!

219
00:20:29,908 --> 00:20:32,169
PENLEY: Now you're not yet well enough. We'll discuss it later.

220
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:42,791
JAMIE: No, it'll be to late then. They might. Oh, my head. No, you must help me save Victoria. It'll be too late.

221
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:29,578
VICTORIA: Doctor, if only I could make this thing work. This is Victoria calling the Doctor or Leader Clent. This is Victoria. Please answer me.

222
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:39,072
ZONDAL: The girl, Commander. She will betray us.

223
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:50,822
VARGA: She has courage. But she is also very stupid to think that we would not watch her every move.

224
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:53,533
ZONDAL: She must be stopped.

225
00:22:12,826 --> 00:22:15,625
DOCTOR: It's Victoria! Victoria, where are you?

226
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:16,725
VICTORIA: I...

227
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:18,217
VICTORIA: I don't know.

228
00:22:18,577 --> 00:22:20,006
VICTORIA: Some sort of cave.

229
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:21,186
DOCTOR: Are you all right?

230
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:26,235
VICTORIA: Yes, but, oh Doctor, something terrible's happened!

231
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:27,085
DOCTOR: What?

232
00:22:27,116 --> 00:22:29,446
VICTORIA: They, they've shot Jamie and Arden!

233
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:36,348
DOCTOR: What? Well, is he dead? Is, is he wounded? Is he badly wounded?

234
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:39,618
VICTORIA: I don't know.

235
00:22:39,678 --> 00:22:40,649
DOCTOR: What do you mean?

236
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,088
VICTORIA: Well, he's gone.

237
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:53,489
VICTORIA: Arden's body's still here and he's dead, but the warriors are from Mars, and. Oh, Doctor, it's horrible!

238
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:58,578
CLENT: Keep calm, girl. We want facts. Tell us about the spacecraft first.

239
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:05,611
VICTORIA: No, please, please listen to me. Arden's dead, and Jamie's disappeared.

240
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:16,979
VICTORIA: Don't you understand? They're ruthless killers and they'll stop at nothing. Now please, listen to me. There's no time to lose.

241
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,348
ZONDAL: Ready to fire.
