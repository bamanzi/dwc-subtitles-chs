1
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:04,796
VICTORIA: Jamie!

2
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:21,933
CLENT: He took just forty five seconds to propose ionisation. No prior knowledge.

3
00:01:22,224 --> 00:01:24,503
ARDEN: Well, it took us and the Academy of Scientists years.

4
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:27,514
GARRETT: The computer took three milliseconds.

5
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:29,295
ARDEN: Yes, well, we had to programme it first.

6
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:35,025
CLENT: Quite. Well, before I make a final decision, I want the computer's assessment on this Doctor.

7
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:36,954
GARRETT: We must be absolutely sure.

8
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:41,505
CLENT: State the work potential and community value of the Doctor.

9
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:53,037
COMPUTER: More information is necessary for a full evaluation. High IQ but undisciplined for our needs. Present evaluation, to be used on research projects, but could be obstructive in certain situations.

10
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:53,946
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are.

11
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:54,617
CLENT: Doctor, would you mind

12
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:56,397
DOCTOR: I've been looking everywhere. Why don't you label your doors?

13
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:58,097
CLENT: Yes, this is a private meeting.

14
00:01:58,156 --> 00:01:59,346
DOCTOR: Yes, I realise that, and I'm sorry.

15
00:01:59,446 --> 00:02:01,267
CLENT: And we have not yet completed our business.

16
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:08,029
DOCTOR: Look, I wouldn't intrude if I didn't think it necessary. What I have to say is extremely important. After all, you did ask me to help you, didn't you?

17
00:02:08,117 --> 00:02:09,057
ARDEN: Has something happened to the warrior?

18
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:10,196
DOCTOR: Well, it has something to do with that, yes.

19
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:12,076
CLENT: We have more serious matters on hand.

20
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:12,887
DOCTOR: This is serious!

21
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:14,256
ARDEN: Now let him tell us, Clent. Well?

22
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:19,358
DOCTOR: Thank you. It's the, it's the helmet. It's not what we thought it was.

23
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:21,998
CLENT: It's a prehistoric drinking cup.

24
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:25,726
DOCTOR: No! It has electronic connections.

25
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:30,517
CLENT: E? What are you talking about?

26
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,778
ARDEN: But that's impossible. You must be mistaken.

27
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:35,938
DOCTOR: No, I'm positive. You realise what this means?

28
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:40,137
ARDEN: Well it must mean the civilisation he came from must be more advanced than we thought.

29
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,660
DOCTOR: Yes, indeed. They even had astronauts, it appears.

30
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:44,919
CLENT: How do you mean?

31
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:50,989
DOCTOR: This headpiece is no warriors tin-hat. It's a highly sophisticated space helmet!

32
00:02:53,028 --> 00:02:55,467
CLENT: Aren't you jumping to conclusions, Doctor, for a scientist?

33
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:56,918
ARDEN: But if this is true?

34
00:02:57,028 --> 00:02:59,277
DOCTOR: If this is true your project is in danger.

35
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:02,948
CLENT: In what way? How can one preserved body, however old, effect us?

36
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:07,858
DOCTOR: How did he get here? Well, he didn't walk, did he?

37
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:09,798
CLENT: Well, if what you say is true, by spaceship.

38
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,518
DOCTOR: Yes, and where is that spaceship now?

39
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:20,538
ARDEN: In the glacier. Then it must still be intact. He had no signs of mutilation. He couldn't have crashed. He must of landed. Clent, can't you see the importance of such a discovery?

40
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:23,832
CLENT: The propulsion unit of the spacecraft is probably

41
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:25,273
GARRETT: Probably atomic powered.

42
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:30,563
CLENT: Quite. And, er, if we use the ioniser at full power

43
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:34,043
DOCTOR: This reactor pile could be exploded or be activated.

44
00:03:34,123 --> 00:03:34,505
CLENT: But if we don't

45
00:03:34,565 --> 00:03:35,857
GARRETT: The whole area will be contaminated.

46
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:41,879
CLENT: But if we don't use the ioniser, what then? We are part of a world plan. Now, if we hold back that plan cannot go into operation.

47
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,259
GARRETT: We could hold it at minimal power.

48
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:45,078
CLENT: Not good enough.

49
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:49,088
ARDEN: No, we daren't take the risk. The contamination level would last for five decades or more.

50
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:51,630
CLENT: It merely makes the fine control of the heat level even more vital.

51
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,728
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I thought you ought to know.

52
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:58,437
CLENT: Yes, you were right, thank you. I must inform the computer immediately for its decision.

53
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,599
ARDEN: Well, we shall need more facts.

54
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,699
CLENT: Well, furnish me with facts then!

55
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:02,330
JAMIE: Doctor!

56
00:04:02,388 --> 00:04:03,149
DOCTOR: Jamie!

57
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,458
JAMIE: The warrior's come alive!

58
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:05,369
ARDEN: Alive?

59
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:05,979
CLENT, DOCTOR + GARRETT: What?

60
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,390
JAMIE: He's taken Victoria. I couldn't stop him!

61
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,518
ARDEN: Alive. and I found it.

62
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:16,486
CLENT: Alive?

63
00:04:16,546 --> 00:04:17,337
DOCTOR: Strange.

64
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:18,907
CLENT: How did it happen?

65
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:23,506
JAMIE: Well, we were just talking, and I turned, and there he was standing right next to us.

66
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:28,748
ARDEN: That's impossible. To be preserved, yes, but to come alive? Impossible.

67
00:04:28,827 --> 00:04:30,177
DOCTOR: For a human being, maybe.

68
00:04:30,347 --> 00:04:31,466
ARDEN: What, not human?

69
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:32,456
DOCTOR: Look at this table.

70
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:34,098
CLENT: Well, it's been burned.

71
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,958
ARDEN: Well, I used a low voltage especially.

72
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:36,927
DOCTOR: Yes, but a high current.

73
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:37,907
ARDEN: Yes but it was quite safe.

74
00:04:37,997 --> 00:04:40,118
DOCTOR: But if that current passed through a low resistance.

75
00:04:40,188 --> 00:04:41,597
GARRETT: Extremely high temperatures.

76
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:43,818
CLENT: The intense heat must have shocked him back into life.

77
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:48,349
JAMIE: Oh look, I don't know what you're all talking about, but all I know is Victoria's in danger and what are we doing to save her?

78
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:49,716
DOCTOR: Yes Jamie, you're right. Come on. She can't have gone far.

79
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:51,117
JAMIE: Well, come on then.

80
00:04:51,616 --> 00:05:00,050
CLENT: Danger red alert, danger red alert. Intruders within perimeter. Capture and control. Priority one. Repeat to all posts.

81
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,421
JAMIE: But within a perimeter? But supposing they're way out of it?

82
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,521
ANNOUNCER: Danger red alert, danger red alert. Intruders within perimeter. Capture and control. Priority one.

83
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,326
CLENT: Well, that'll be just too bad. Obviously I can't release men for an extensive search outside the base.

84
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:09,525
DOCTOR: But she may be in danger of her life! You can't take that decision!

85
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:17,629
CLENT: Very well. You want an impartial opinion? I shall ask the computer.

86
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,919
JAMIE: Oh, not the computer.

87
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:20,360
DOCTOR: It's a waste of time asking the computer.

88
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:27,149
VICTORIA: Who are you?

89
00:05:28,106 --> 00:05:28,767
VARGA: (hissing) Varga.

90
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:29,956
VICTORIA: Where are you from?

91
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:32,157
VARGA: From the Red Planet.

92
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:42,847
VICTORIA: Mars? We thought you were dead and then you came alive. What happened?

93
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:44,656
VARGA: Too many questions.

94
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:48,256
VICTORIA: I'm curious, that's all.

95
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:51,576
VARGA: I need answers from you.

96
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:54,498
VICTORIA: I don't think I can help you very much.

97
00:05:55,726 --> 00:05:57,006
VARGA: Answers.

98
00:05:58,097 --> 00:05:59,097
VICTORIA: Is that a gun?

99
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,606
VARGA: How long was I in the ice?

100
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:12,407
VICTORIA: I don't know, I. One of the scientists said you must have been there since the first ice age. Thousands of years ago.

101
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:13,798
VARGA: That cannot be true.

102
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:17,168
VICTORIA: Were there others with you?

103
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:31,311
VARGA: Yes. Our spaceship crashed at the foot of the ice mountain. As we came out to investigate, a great avalanche of snow buried us.

104
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:36,501
VICTORIA: Then the others are still trapped in the glacier, then.

105
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:42,361
VARGA: I will free them. Then we will return to the Red Planet.

106
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:46,480
VICTORIA: How? You can't get them out by yourself.

107
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:51,000
VARGA: You will help. How was I brought to life?

108
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:54,080
VICTORIA: Let the scientists here on Earth help you.

109
00:06:54,209 --> 00:07:07,739
VARGA: Tell me! They would not help me. They would keep me as a curiosity, and they would leave my warriors for dead, or destroy them.

110
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:11,199
VICTORIA: No. No, they, they wouldn't.

111
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:19,069
VARGA: But with my men, I can talk from strength. Then we shall decide.

112
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,700
VICTORIA: Decide? Decide what?

113
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,519
VARGA: Whether to go back to our own world, or to conquer this.

114
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,300
CLENT: All relevant factors now presented. How should we act?

115
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:36,670
JAMIE: Och, how's a machine to know?

116
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,301
DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie, have patience. Give it a chance.

117
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:43,350
COMPUTER: Ionisation programme should continue as planned. A limited number of lives are expected to be lost.

118
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:44,680
JAMIE: What about Victoria, though?

119
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,532
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie.

120
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:52,598
COMPUTER: However, the suspected presence of an alien spacecraft must be investigated, in case of potentially fissionable material.

121
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:55,921
JAMIE: Spacecraft! Hey, do you reckon that's where the warrior's gone back to?

122
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,180
DOCTOR: Well, he didn't come by Shetland Pony, Jamie.

123
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,311
COMPUTER: In order to accommodate this priority the workload has been rescheduled to free one scientist investigator.

124
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:05,641
CLENT: Who should be released?

125
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:07,346
COMPUTER: Scientist Arden.

126
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:12,978
CLENT: Well, Arden, do you think you could handle this ice giant single-handed?

127
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:15,547
ARDEN: Well, I shall need at least one guard.

128
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:17,277
JAMIE: Well, what about me then? I could go with him.

129
00:08:17,316 --> 00:08:18,436
DOCTOR: Yes, he's a capable lad.

130
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:19,947
CLENT: Well, the computer said one investigator only.

131
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:22,167
DOCTOR: That was from your staff, Jamie's extra.

132
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:22,756
JAMIE: Aye.

133
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:26,385
GARRETT: The mission must be carried out. The computer has ordered it.

134
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:33,014
CLENT: As the Doctor has agreed to help us with the ioniser. Yes, very well, the boy can go.

135
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:33,585
DOCTOR: Oh good.

136
00:08:33,684 --> 00:08:37,885
CLENT: But you must leave immediately, because the sooner we know whether there is a reactor buried inside that glacier or not, the better.

137
00:08:37,974 --> 00:08:40,793
JAMIE: Aye, maybe, but Victoria's important too, you know.

138
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:49,090
CLENT: You don't seem to realise, boy, the fate of the world could be at stake. The girl must take her chance.

139
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,689
STORR: What ye trying to do? Cripple me?

140
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:58,990
PENLEY: You know the trouble with you. Storr? You're just stupid.

141
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:01,349
STORR: How was I to know it would get infected?

142
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:03,459
PENLEY: If you'd listened to me in the first place.

143
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:08,529
STORR: Aye, you'd have stuffed me to the eyeballs with anti-this and anti-that. I'd have been flat on my back for weeks.

144
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:10,320
PENLEY: Where as now, you're fighting fit.

145
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,979
STORR: Ach, well, someone has to do things.

146
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:15,299
PENLEY: Mmm. Well, that someone isn't going to be you.

147
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,249
STORR: Ach, it's nothing. I'll pull through.

148
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:24,793
PENLEY: Yes, I'm rather afraid you will. But if you don't do what I say you'll soon be in a coma, which at least would give me a bit of peace.

149
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,096
STORR: Don't try scare me with all that scientific guff.

150
00:09:28,204 --> 00:09:33,794
PENLEY: I'm just telling you, Storr. You got a headache?

151
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:35,208
STORR: Ach, it's nothing.

152
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:42,999
PENLEY: What I like about you is if a polar bear got you you'd give him indigestion. Feeling fuzzy in the head, eh?

153
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:50,660
STORR: I will not let it beat me. Is it going to be bad?

154
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,592
PENLEY: You won't know much about it.

155
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:55,081
STORR: My mouth's dry.

156
00:09:56,022 --> 00:10:01,111
PENLEY: Here's a what do you call it? A tomato. It's nearly ripe.

157
00:10:02,712 --> 00:10:07,569
STORR: Ach, you shouldnae have done that. I've been waiting weeks for that to ripen properly.

158
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,849
PENLEY: Take it, it'll do you good.

159
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:10,699
STORR: Ach.

160
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:16,259
PENLEY: Well, there are advantages to living in a plant museum, even this close to the glacier.

161
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:19,120
STORR: Ah, so even a scientist can appreciate it then?

162
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:30,611
PENLEY: Well, there's warmth and food. Selected ancient food plants. Tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, strawberries. A world out of Atlantis.

163
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:46,754
STORR: Aye, helps me picture how it was before they killed off all the plants. There was spring then, and flowers. You could pick the fruit off the trees. Now you rotten scientists (coughs) drop down dead.

164
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:52,985
PENLEY: Even so it's not the nicest way to live.

165
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:53,835
STORR: Aye.

166
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:55,654
PENLEY: An avalanche waiting on your doorstep.

167
00:10:55,903 --> 00:10:57,414
STORR: Not leaving here until I have to.

168
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,444
PENLEY: Granted.

169
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:10,909
STORR: You're not going out after food, are you? You wouldn't know what to do without me. Where are you going, anyway?

170
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,950
PENLEY: Well I've learnt enough from you to take care of myself, and it's for your idiotic sake that I'm going.

171
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,034
STORR: Where to?

172
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:20,165
PENLEY: The base.

173
00:11:21,825 --> 00:11:31,975
STORR: You're going to hand me in to rehabilitation. Africa. Never trust anybody.

174
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:37,575
PENLEY: I'm going for drugs. And if I don't get them, you're as good as dead.

175
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:44,955
VICTORIA: It's, it's, it's, it's a

176
00:11:45,614 --> 00:11:46,644
VARGA: Go on.

177
00:11:46,803 --> 00:11:57,404
VICTORIA: It's a black box with wires. They connected it to you, and you came alive. I, well, I don't know how!

178
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:17,411
VARGA: A power source. Resistance. A great heat and then life. This room we came from. We will go back to it.

179
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,970
VICTORIA: I'll tell you how to get there.

180
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:30,402
VARGA: You will take me there. Without that power unit, my warriors are lifeless.

181
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:36,821
VICTORIA: But we have to go down the corridors. Supposing someone sees you?

182
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:41,761
VARGA: I shall kill them. And you.

183
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:42,760
VICTORIA: Me?

184
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,781
VARGA: If you call for help.

185
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,532
VICTORIA: What is that?

186
00:12:47,752 --> 00:12:53,333
VARGA: Sonic gun. It will burst your brain with noise.

187
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:58,872
JAMIE: There's no one been here. There's not a mark.

188
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:02,532
ARDEN: Well, we didn't pass them on the way. Now, stand aside lad, will you?

189
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:10,118
JAMIE: We were wrong, then. He's lost out there somewhere, Victoria with him.

190
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:32,163
ARDEN: I can't get a reading. There's something inside there, but all it's doing is creating havoc with this radiation sensor. Arden calling Leader Clent. Arden calling Leader Clent, answer please.

191
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:33,973
CLENT: Clent here. Report.

192
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:39,413
ARDEN: There's no sign of the fugitive or the girl. They didn't, couldn't have come this way.

193
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:42,294
CLENT: That was not the purpose of your mission. Please report correctly.

194
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:51,253
ARDEN: No reading obtainable. The sensor is being jammed by some sort of a screening device. I can't make head nor tail of it.

195
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:52,682
CLENT: But something is in there.

196
00:13:54,023 --> 00:13:55,021
ARDEN: Correct.

197
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:57,642
CLENT: Well, come on then, man! Don't waste time. Go in and find out what it is!

198
00:13:57,642 --> 00:14:00,072
ARDEN: Well, not with the equipment I have with me now.

199
00:14:01,312 --> 00:14:04,244
CLENT: Very well then, return at once. The mission will be repeated with the correct equipment.

200
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:07,294
ARDEN: But this is the proper equipment for the job.

201
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:09,943
CLENT: Obviously not. Don't waste time. Return immediately. Out.

202
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,474
JAMIE: A nice boss you've got there.

203
00:14:12,914 --> 00:14:20,853
ARDEN: Yes. The trouble with Clent is that he's not a proper scientist, he's an organiser. He should've been born a robot.

204
00:14:20,914 --> 00:14:22,015
JAMIE: Let's go on.

205
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:04,749
VICTORIA: No, no, it's not in there. It's further down the corridor.

206
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:42,170
VARGA: The black box. Find it, quickly.

207
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,890
GARRETT: It's still on half power, but it's holding well.

208
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:51,240
CLENT: Good. Well?

209
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,812
DOCTOR: Well, I still think you ought to get in an expert. Why can't you get one?

210
00:15:56,812 --> 00:15:57,942
CLENT: I choose not to.

211
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:00,542
DOCTOR: But why?

212
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:03,353
CLENT: You're not here to question me.

213
00:16:03,483 --> 00:16:08,054
DOCTOR: No, I'm here to help you, if I choose.

214
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:24,235
CLENT: This is the most important job I've ever had. Now, every other project I've handled with ease. Nothing has failed. I was chosen because I never fail. When I handpicked the team, I made one vital mistake.

215
00:16:24,427 --> 00:16:25,736
DOCTOR: This chap Penley.

216
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:31,767
CLENT: Best man in Europe for ionisation studies. As it turned out, hopelessly temperamental.

217
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:38,082
DOCTOR: Temperamental or individual? Creative scientists have to be allowed some head you know.

218
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:44,922
CLENT: Creative? Poppycock. When he walked out of here he proclaimed himself to be criminally, criminally irresponsible.

219
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:47,333
DOCTOR: It couldn't have been just a simple gesture of protest?

220
00:16:47,444 --> 00:16:52,784
CLENT: He was always protesting. This is a team, a team with a mission. If we fail, others cannot succeed.

221
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:55,204
DOCTOR: And your name will suffer. That's important.

222
00:16:55,293 --> 00:17:02,674
CLENT: I lead the team. I depend on the experts I picked. My judgement was sound. Others won't see it that way.

223
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:04,154
DOCTOR: So you do need Penley.

224
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:15,234
CLENT: No, I do not need Penley. But I do need an equivalent brain. But it would be months before anyone else could pick up the knowledge that Penley acquired here. Just isn't time, that's the pertinent issue.

225
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:21,613
DOCTOR: Well, I'll try and help you, but I do think you might try trusting human beings instead of computers.

226
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:37,473
CLENT: I trust no one, Doctor. Not any more. Human emotions are unreliable. I'll just go and see that the working area reserved for you in the Medi-Control Centre is ready.

227
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:45,117
VARGA: The power pack.

228
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:47,416
VICTORIA: I'm looking!

229
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:09,403
VICTORIA: Yes, yes, they look like the one. Yes, yes.

230
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:23,952
VARGA: You are coming with me, to the ice mountain.

231
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:26,211
VICTORIA: No, please.

232
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:34,894
CLENT: Who are you?

233
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:39,074
VICTORIA: You killed him!

234
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:43,904
VARGA: Come.

235
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:10,528
PENLEY: I er, I was going to give him this.

236
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:23,287
DOCTOR: Oh, that's disgusting. It's just the thing. Did you do this?

237
00:19:23,677 --> 00:19:27,467
PENLEY: I've come very close to it at times. I've never seen him look so peaceful.

238
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:31,076
DOCTOR: Oh, he'll be all right. Did you see who did do it?

239
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:34,897
PENLEY: Yes. A monstrous looking creature. I didn't like the look of him at all.

240
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,268
DOCTOR: Was there a girl there?

241
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:38,149
PENLEY: Yes, she seemed scared stiff.

242
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,527
DOCTOR: Well, why didn't you try and stop them?

243
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:43,207
PENLEY: Well, I came here to get some drugs for a man who is sick. I couldn't run the risk of getting caught.

244
00:19:43,207 --> 00:19:44,380
DOCTOR: But she's only a young girl!

245
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,590
PENLEY: She's alive. My friend will die if I don't get back.

246
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,779
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I see.

247
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:52,340
PENLEY: Are you going after them? I can take you part of the way.

248
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,870
DOCTOR: No, no, they're searching already. There's a red alarm all over the base.

249
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:56,070
PENLEY: Well, I've got what I want. I'm off.

250
00:19:58,056 --> 00:19:58,924
DOCTOR: Penley?

251
00:20:02,015 --> 00:20:05,776
PENLEY: You know about me then. My escapades in computer-land.

252
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:08,967
DOCTOR: They need you here, you know. They need you desperately.

253
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:12,726
PENLEY: Needing isn't getting. I'm free of their problems for good.

254
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:17,546
DOCTOR: They're your problems too, you know. It's your world.

255
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:23,366
PENLEY: My world is up here. Private and no admittance. Well, I'm going to go then.

256
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:25,765
DOCTOR: I expect you know what you're doing.

257
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:28,776
PENLEY: You know it's nice to meet one that they haven't got at yet.

258
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:30,616
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you.

259
00:20:30,675 --> 00:20:31,531
PENLEY: Goodbye.

260
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:32,286
DOCTOR: Goodbye.

261
00:20:37,957 --> 00:20:38,866
GARRETT: They're in here.

262
00:20:40,843 --> 00:20:41,554
DOCTOR: Where's Victoria?

263
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:42,542
GARRETT: Leader Clent!

264
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:43,073
ARDEN: What's happened?

265
00:20:43,203 --> 00:20:44,233
CLENT: Where are they?

266
00:20:44,324 --> 00:20:48,134
GARRETT: I've just had a message from the perimeter gate. He smashed his way through, taking the girl with him.

267
00:20:48,454 --> 00:20:51,603
CLENT: He knocked me out with a power pack.

268
00:20:51,673 --> 00:20:55,352
DOCTOR: With a power pack? You mean the one that you used to unfreeze him?

269
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:59,443
CLENT: Yes. And he and the girl have many more.

270
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:01,543
ARDEN: To revitalise others like himself.

271
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:05,493
CLENT: Others? What do you mean. We don't know that there are others.

272
00:21:05,553 --> 00:21:07,613
JAMIE: Well now, he'll head for the glacier. Let's get way after him.

273
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:14,522
DOCTOR: No. That's what he wants us to do. That's why he's taken Victoria with him as a hostage. No, we must let him show his hand first.

274
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,834
JAMIE: But we can't just stand around waiting?

275
00:21:15,894 --> 00:21:18,674
DOCTOR: We're not going to. Only until morning. That'll be time enough.

276
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:25,974
CLENT: No, now! Must I remind you of the mission that you have yet to accomplish?

277
00:21:26,074 --> 00:21:31,863
ARDEN: Oh no, Clent, not at night. Not for you or anybody. You've never been out there at night.

278
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:52,527
VARGA: I have located my warriors. When your friends come after us, they will find a surprise.

279
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,836
VICTORIA: What are you going to do?

280
00:21:55,836 --> 00:22:06,005
VARGA: You'll see. Don't try to run away.

281
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:09,466
VICTORIA: I was only going to watch you.

282
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,806
VARGA: You are going to help me.

283
00:22:22,438 --> 00:23:01,676
PENLEY: Twenty four hours and you'll be your old animal-like self again. And while you're undergoing repairs, Storr, old chap, I'm going to do a bit of hunting myself, up on the glacier. Something strange is happening, Elric Penley, honoured sir. That warrior, that girl, that funny, scruffy looking chap. Something strange indeed. Something disturbing. Something to do with the ice. And if what that particular chap has said is true, if they really need me, it may mean the parting of the ways for us.

284
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:23,839
VARGA: It's done. They are free. And now, to bring them back to life.
