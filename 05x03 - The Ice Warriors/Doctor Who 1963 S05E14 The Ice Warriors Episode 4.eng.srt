1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:07,002
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,455
Ready to fire.

3
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:26,716
Not yet.

4
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:33,770
She has betrayed us.
She must be destroyed.

5
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,748
Let her talk first.

6
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:38,447
They will know our numbers.

7
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:44,945
They will also know she
is alive. She is a bait.

8
00:01:45,263 --> 00:01:47,822
Victoria, tell us more
about the warriors.

9
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:49,557
Er, they're from Mars...

10
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:53,755
They're not important. Have you seen the
propulsion unit of the spacecraft, girl?

11
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:55,261
Oh, propulsion unit?

12
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,459
The engines!

13
00:01:56,626 --> 00:01:59,297
Oh yes. They're busy repairing them now.

14
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:03,008
What kind are they?
It's vitally important.

15
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,551
I... I've no idea!

16
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:12,066
Well, reactor turbine? lon
jet? Anti-gravity? Think girl!

17
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,067
Can you describe them
to us, Victoria dear?

18
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:16,580
Yes, yes I think so.

19
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:18,148
Well hurry girl!

20
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,284
Look it isn't easy. Now I
have to have time to think...

21
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:26,635
Victoria? Victoria what's happened?
Are you alright? Answer me!

22
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,353
I'm alright.

23
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:35,838
It's the glacier. It's
moving all the time.

24
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:37,097
You're not hurt?

25
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:39,613
The engines, tell us about the engines!

26
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,299
She has told them enough. Bring her in.

27
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:50,119
Destroy her.

28
00:02:50,382 --> 00:03:06,003
You are wrong Zondal. She must answer some questions first.
Why are they so interested in our engines? Why are they afraid?

29
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,731
There's... there's someone coming!

30
00:03:11,642 --> 00:03:16,017
Victoria... Victoria. Can you
see the base from where you are?

31
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:18,240
Yes. Yes I can.

32
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,837
Do you think you can get back to it?

33
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,653
I can give it a try.

34
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:26,003
Well, get in contact again
as soon as you can! Good luck!

35
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:08,897
Yes.

36
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,897
This is an automatic
chemical dispenser is it not?

37
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:13,644
Yes.

38
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:14,676
How does it work?

39
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:20,577
Well, you choose the category of the article that you want
by, er, indicating it on one of these little chaps here.

40
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:26,121
Jolly good. And er, now you dial the
precise chemical formula that you want there.

41
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:28,584
May I? There's something
I need rather desperately.

42
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:37,240
Oh, what's that?

43
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:38,363
Water.

44
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:39,733
Indeed.

45
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:47,652
Ah, that's better. Now then,
let's see. Jamie has vanished.

46
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:50,997
Victoria's on her way back to the base.

47
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:55,051
And neither of them can help
us with our main problem.

48
00:04:56,138 --> 00:05:00,313
An exact description of the
spacecrafts propulsion unit.

49
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,158
That will?

50
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:03,397
I will.

51
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,171
With the help of ammonium sulphide?

52
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:12,730
We know these creatures come from Mars, don't we? What
do we know about their planet's atmospheric conditions?

53
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:17,119
Chiefly nitrogen with
virtually no oxygen or hydrogen.

54
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,569
Then they're not going to enjoy this
little concoction much, are they?

55
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:24,202
What? You mean you plan to use
it as a kind of... toxic gas?

56
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:28,193
Well, if I'm going to an alien
spaceship it may come in handy.

57
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:33,195
Now don't be ridiculous.
We've lost Arden already.

58
00:05:33,388 --> 00:05:36,023
Arden fell into a trap.
I know what to expect.

59
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:37,991
I, I, I refuse to allow you to go!

60
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:39,273
Splendid! You go instead then!

61
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:41,598
No one can be spared!
Least of all Leader Clent!

62
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:48,410
I can be spared. I've done all I can here. The ioniser
will work without me. I'll start getting ready then.

63
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,194
But if anything goes
wrong with the countdown!

64
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:51,427
Oh, you'll manage.

65
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:52,481
No!

66
00:05:52,905 --> 00:06:03,887
It's as simple as this: someone has to get to the spacecraft, find out what sort of propulsion unit
it has, and bring the information back to you! Or we can't use the ioniser! Now, who better than me?

67
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:19,539
I've come to regard you as Penley's replacement. And,
um... alright, alright! But it's strictly under protest!

68
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:20,529
Thank you.

69
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:21,941
How will you get the
information back to us?

70
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:26,596
Ah. Now I don't suppose you have
a, a, a, a small radio transmitter?

71
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,119
No, our video links are the only communicators
available. Pure sound is no longer in use.

72
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:33,746
Oh, well you won't see
me, but you'll hear me.

73
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:37,781
As soon as I get to the glacier face I'll
switch it on and you'll overhear. I hope.

74
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:40,935
Is that all you're taking?

75
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:42,654
Why, what else do I need?

76
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:44,253
But the Warriors are armed!

77
00:06:44,677 --> 00:06:46,199
But I'm not going to fight a duel.

78
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,992
But you must be in a
position to defend yourself!

79
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:51,121
They'll try to kill you out of hand!

80
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:52,461
Oh, I don't think so.

81
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:53,970
This is my defence.

82
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:57,752
But how can you rely on that? They've already
proved themselves to be utterly ruthless.

83
00:06:58,025 --> 00:06:59,207
I think they'll listen to me.

84
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:03,180
You mean you're going to
let them take you prisoner?

85
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,030
That is exactly what I'm going to do.

86
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:43,925
I think he's gonna wake.

87
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:47,529
Pulse isn't too good.

88
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:50,849
His fever's gone.

89
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,226
Well, his body is young. It will heal.

90
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,002
Then, why you looking so worried?

91
00:08:56,342 --> 00:09:00,651
I don't know yet. The weapons they used on him
- they're curious.

92
00:09:00,846 --> 00:09:03,083
Aye, scientifically designed, of course.

93
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:04,594
This is no time for debates.

94
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:07,583
Aye, it's easily said. I'll
away and fetch a fresh drink.

95
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:11,526
You'll not keep me prisoner!

96
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,145
Stay still!

97
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:12,944
No get away out of it!

98
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:13,516
Storr!

99
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:14,155
Stop fighting!

100
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:14,872
You'll not keep me!

101
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:15,825
We're your friends!

102
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:16,792
We saved your life!

103
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,102
Oh, ooh.

104
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:21,100
Oh my head. Ah.

105
00:09:24,318 --> 00:09:25,048
What you doing to me?

106
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,645
I'm going to try and ease your
pain with this tranquiliser pad.

107
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:28,641
I don't believe you!

108
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,575
Now you must trust us. We know about
your friend. We may be able to help.

109
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,115
Victoria? Well where is she?

110
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,607
In the alien spaceship.

111
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:38,691
Alien?

112
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:42,959
These warriors are not of
our time. Nor of this planet.

113
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:45,667
So, how would you know all that?

114
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,175
Ah, because he's a scientist. He can
produce an explanation for anything.

115
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:51,484
And you?

116
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:53,260
I'm a loyalist.

117
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,642
A loyalist!

118
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:56,807
Ah! They've told you have they?

119
00:09:56,965 --> 00:10:00,268
Aye! But there's no time to talk.
I came here to rescue Victoria.

120
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:01,168
You're in no way...

121
00:10:01,348 --> 00:10:02,623
Oh, just you try me.
Here give me a hand.

122
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,434
He's not as bad as you say Penley.

123
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:05,948
Your scientists aren't always right!

124
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:07,937
Ah ha! You hear that Penley!

125
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:09,750
But, your legs are still weak.

126
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,069
My legs! I can't feel my
- I can't stand!

127
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,163
Oh, is this what your
stupid drugs can do?

128
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,868
Don't be a fool, Storr. Of
course it's not the drugs.

129
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,743
Well what is it then?

130
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:22,363
Well their weapons must have
affected your central nervous system.

131
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:24,177
You mean I'm paralysed?

132
00:10:46,988 --> 00:10:48,714
Where is the girl?

133
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,558
Turoc has not yet returned.

134
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:55,864
He must find her.

135
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:57,293
Why?

136
00:10:57,487 --> 00:11:02,471
We need her to draw an
intelligent being from the base.

137
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:06,629
To find out the kind
of reactor they use.

138
00:11:06,818 --> 00:11:16,883
Yes. Without the _ fuel
elements we are helpless.

139
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:19,138
And if they have them?

140
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,117
We shall take them.

141
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:28,564
Is the fuel completely run down?

142
00:11:33,474 --> 00:11:41,204
If the scientists succeed
in melting the ice?

143
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,147
There will be floods.

144
00:11:44,664 --> 00:11:48,962
No hope for our engines, then?

145
00:11:49,486 --> 00:11:51,681
Or for us.

146
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,394
The gun is our only chance.

147
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:18,783
Help! Oh, somebody help
me! Ugh! Help! Somebody!

148
00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:38,441
Arrgghh! Oh no! No! Oh please!
Help me somebody! Please help me!

149
00:12:41,106 --> 00:12:44,434
Well, there's nothing more I can do for him.
That's the last of the tranquiliser pads.

150
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:46,927
Do ye... understand his illness?

151
00:12:47,122 --> 00:12:49,249
No, and I've no way
of knowing the cause.

152
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:52,454
Well, there's one way we can save him.

153
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:53,474
How?

154
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:55,489
To befriend the aliens.

155
00:12:55,657 --> 00:12:57,004
Oh don't be a fool Storr!

156
00:12:57,141 --> 00:13:00,157
Oh they'll help us. I'll talk
to them. They'll understand.

157
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:02,115
But they're warriors, trained to kill.

158
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:04,443
Ach, only in self-defense, surely.

159
00:13:04,572 --> 00:13:06,908
Oh rubbish no! We've got to
get the boy back to the base.

160
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:07,692
No!

161
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:08,840
For the boy's sake.

162
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:16,773
Oh, ye, ye, ye trying to trap me! There's no return for me to
the civilisation that Clent represents. This is where I stay.

163
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:19,008
Do you think the aliens are
any better? They killed Arden.

164
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:20,519
Ar, they were afraid.

165
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,984
They're ruthless, they
place no value on human life.

166
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,640
Well I'll talk to them. Someone has to.

167
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:29,149
We don't know what they're
capable of, or why they're here.

168
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:31,788
Well, I'll ask questions
first, then act.

169
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,358
It may be too late then.

170
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:35,697
We'll see.

171
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,408
No
- wait! Storr, look, you don't know what you're running into!

172
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:41,943
Now don't try and stop
me! You look after the boy.

173
00:13:52,492 --> 00:14:06,045
Storr! Storr! Storr! Storr!

174
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:18,307
Can you hear me! Help! Oh! I'm trapped!

175
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:42,579
Oh, oh it's you again, is it?

176
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,461
Has anyone passed this way?

177
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:47,000
No. Are you looking for someone?

178
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:48,835
A rather ragged fellow. Like me.

179
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:51,366
No, nobody. Not even like me.

180
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,382
Then I'm too late.
There's nothing I can do.

181
00:14:54,885 --> 00:14:56,149
Can I help you?

182
00:14:56,321 --> 00:15:00,029
Well you've helped me once already. Why didn't
you give me away, or stop me at the base?

183
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,875
Well why should I? I don't
believe everything Clent tells me.

184
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:06,928
This boy. He's your friend.

185
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:11,061
You know where he is? Is he hurt?

186
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:12,769
Come this way.

187
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,008
Help me please!

188
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:31,043
Who are you?

189
00:15:31,902 --> 00:15:33,638
Never mind about that now.

190
00:15:34,203 --> 00:15:35,771
Would you release me please?

191
00:15:36,974 --> 00:15:38,380
Wh, what happened?

192
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:42,377
I run away and the warrior
caught me. The ice fell...

193
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,172
You ran away? But why?

194
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:49,774
The warriors
- they're evil. They killed Arden. I think they want to destroy the base.

195
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,958
They are against the scientists?

196
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:56,123
I know, but they won't listen. They think
the ioniser is a weapon against them.

197
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,275
Ah, it's true. A weapon of destruction.

198
00:15:58,449 --> 00:15:59,840
Only to destroy the ice.

199
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:01,771
Ah, it will destroy civilisation.

200
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:04,000
Anyway, thank you.

201
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:04,972
Uh.

202
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,560
Ah, where were you going?

203
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:08,803
Uh well, your friend, the boy.

204
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:11,848
Jamie! Jamie, he's
alive! Oh, is he alright?

205
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:13,674
Ah, he's desperately
ill. I'm going for help.

206
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,608
But where?

207
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:18,660
We'd better move out of here
- quickly!

208
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:33,100
Is it ready?

209
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:45,270
We are checking the motivator. Realign
harmonic frequencies to target points.

210
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:56,495
When do we attack the base?

211
00:16:56,692 --> 00:17:06,478
Soon, Zondal, soon. Has Turoc returned?

212
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,959
Not yet Sir.

213
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:18,293
The ice, it is alive.

214
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,366
The spaceship!

215
00:17:26,636 --> 00:17:27,328
Aye.

216
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:28,635
You came here on purpose?

217
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:29,461
Of course!

218
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:30,435
I'm not coming with you!

219
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:33,638
Oh, but you must! We must! You'll
- we'll be safe! They'll listen to me.

220
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:36,121
But they won't! You can't trust them.

221
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:39,543
Arh, they're against the scientists and
the ioniser. That's good enough for me!

222
00:17:39,663 --> 00:17:42,450
Is that your reason?
I think that's wicked!

223
00:17:42,638 --> 00:17:43,448
Ar, they'll understand.

224
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,416
Let go of me!

225
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:45,048
Oh!

226
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,221
Where's Turoc?

227
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:54,341
He... he was crushed by the ice.

228
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:56,955
Oh!

229
00:17:57,147 --> 00:18:04,644
I give you your life. You run away.
Because of that, one of my men is dead!

230
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:07,177
Honestly, it wasn't my fault!

231
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:09,523
Take her inside.

232
00:18:09,774 --> 00:18:11,899
You're not going to kill me are you?

233
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:16,593
My name is Storr. I'm
a scavenger. A loyalist.

234
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:18,718
You are from the base?

235
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:20,877
No, I'm against the scientists.

236
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,214
You know nothing of their machines?

237
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:29,962
No, I don't want to. Their intentions are
evil. I want to help you destroy the scientists.

238
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:35,132
You. What good are you to us?

239
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:39,527
Oh well, I know the land around
here. I've lived here all my life.

240
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:45,112
You are not a scientist.
Only a local native.

241
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:50,116
Useless and unnecessary.

242
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,925
Oh, but I want to help you!

243
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:08,980
Now, to question the girl.

244
00:19:13,331 --> 00:19:14,635
There we are!

245
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:17,199
Good to see you again, Doctor.

246
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:19,421
Ah, won't be long before you're
on your feet again, Jamie.

247
00:19:19,571 --> 00:19:20,469
How long?

248
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:25,365
Well, that depends. You've had some sort of shock
to your brain, it's affected your nervous system.

249
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,037
I will walk again, though?

250
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:30,015
Oh, yeah, of course you will. It's
just a matter of time, that's all.

251
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,074
Aye, well I'll take your word on that.

252
00:19:32,393 --> 00:19:34,145
What can we do for him?

253
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,521
Well the base is the only
place he can be treated.

254
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:38,422
Yes I know that, but he
can't get there alone.

255
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:53,053
That's the glacier. It's
moving forward even faster.

256
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,302
Yes. It'll flatten this
place in no time at all.

257
00:19:56,517 --> 00:19:59,013
Alright. I'll help you take him back.

258
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,924
Well that's just it, you see. I, I
can't go, there's something I must do.

259
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:10,118
Well you don't expect me to face Clent alone? That mouth-piece of
the computer? He's got a printed circuit where his heart should be!

260
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:14,755
He's a man with a mission. I don't
think he can afford to reject you.

261
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:16,759
Well that's not the point.
Anyway, what are you gonna do?

262
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,247
I must speak with the warriors.

263
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:19,052
No Doctor!

264
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:20,242
Well what can you do alone?

265
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:28,313
I have to see whether Victoria got away safely, and I must find out whether this
spacecraft is a danger to the ionisation program. I, I admit it won't be easy.

266
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:31,239
Doctor, if you go to the
warriors you'll be their prisoner!

267
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:33,608
Their guest I hope, Jamie.

268
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:49,062
Look Miss Garrett, look. The glacier's moving. That's the
fifth surge today. The ioniser just isn't holding it anymore.

269
00:20:49,402 --> 00:20:51,522
But we daren't increase
power beyond the minimal.

270
00:20:53,502 --> 00:21:02,219
Well I know the risk if the spaceship explodes. _ radioactivity
level. We'd only replace one disaster with an even greater one.

271
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:04,473
But you must make a decision soon.

272
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:14,584
No decision to be made yet! Computer can act only when given adequate
information. We still don't know enough about the alien reactor.

273
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,826
Suppose we never know? Suppose
the Doctor never returns?

274
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,830
We'll face that if and when we have to.

275
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:27,437
But you must have a
plan in mind, surely?

276
00:21:28,707 --> 00:21:34,048
I'm pinning all my hopes on
the Doctor. He must succeed.

277
00:21:34,236 --> 00:21:36,861
Here we go, Clent old
chap. Wish me luck.

278
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,530
Anyone at home?

279
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:40,244
Open up. Come on, open up, I say! Very well,
I shall count to ten. One... two... three... ah!

280
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:47,819
Who are you?

281
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:51,383
I never answer questions
until I'm addressed properly.

282
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:55,943
You will answer now.

283
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:23,568
Very well. You are standing in the airlock of this spacecraft. Unless you answer my
questions, within ten seconds I will take atmospheric pressure around you down to zero.

284
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,651
But if you do that my body will explode!

285
00:23:27,794 --> 00:23:36,034
One... two... three... four...
