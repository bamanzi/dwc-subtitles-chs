Well hurry girl!

这不是太容易, 我得有点时间想想．．．

他们为什么对我们的引擎这么有兴趣？他们为什么会害怕？

这样，你选择你想要的物品种类，在这些小东西上面指定

很好，　然后你就按化学方程式转动这个拨号盘

Victoria's on her way back to the base.

With the help of ammonium sulphide?

主要是氮气, 而氧气和氢气几乎没有

那他们应该不会喜欢这小瓶化合物, 是吧？

56
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:24,202
What? You mean you plan to use it as a kind of... toxic gas?
什么？你是说你打算把它用作一种．．．毒气？

Well, if I'm going to an alien spaceship it may come in handy.
呵, 如果我要上外星人的飞船, 带这个很方便

00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:33,195
Now don't be ridiculous. We've lost Arden already.

63
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:48,410
I can be spared. I've done all I can here. The ioniser will work without me. I'll start getting ready then.
我是多余的, 我在这里能做的都做了．没有我离子器也能工作了, 我现在就开始准备．

64
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,194
But if anything goes wrong with the countdown!

66
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:52,481
No!
不！

67
00:05:52,905 --> 00:05:57,887
It's as simple as this: someone has to get to the spacecraft, find out what sort of propulsion unit it has,
这事很简单：必须得有人到飞船那里去, 弄明白到底用的是哪种推进装置

68
00:05:57,905 --> 00:06:00,887
and bring the information back to you! Or we can't use the ioniser!
并且把信息带回给你．否则我们不敢使用离子器！

69
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:03,887
Now, who better than me?
现在, 谁比我更合适？

我已经把你奉为 Penlay 的继任了．而且．．．

73
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:21,941
How will you get the information back to us?
你怎么把信息带回给我们？

Ah. Now I don't suppose you have a, a, a, a small radio transmitter?
啊, 好像你们并没有一个．．一个微型的无线电传输器吧？

75
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,119
No, our video links are the only communicators available. Pure sound is no longer in use.
没有．我们唯一可用的通讯方式是视频通话．早就没在用纯语音了

76
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:33,746
Oh, well you won't see me, but you'll hear me.
哦, 那到时候你可能看不到, 但可以听到我说话

77
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:37,781
As soon as I get to the glacier face I'll switch it on and you'll overhear. I hope.
我一达到冰山表面就打开它, 你们可以偷听了．期望如此

78
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:40,935
Is that all you're taking?
你就带这些东西去吗？

79
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:42,654
Why, what else do I need?
难道, 还需要别的什么？

80
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:44,253
But the Warriors are armed!
但那些寒冰勇士是有武器的！

81
00:06:44,677 --> 00:06:46,199
But I'm not going to fight a duel.
我又不是去跟他们决斗

82
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,992
But you must be in a position to defend yourself!

They'll try to kill you out of hand!

84
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:52,461
Oh, I don't think so.
哦, 我可不这么想

85
00:06:52,736 --> 00:06:53,970
This is my defence.
这就是我的防御

86
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:57,752
But how can you rely on that? They've already proved themselves to be utterly ruthless.
你怎么能指望那个东西？事实已经证明他们是非常冷血的

87
00:06:58,025 --> 00:06:59,207
I think they'll listen to me.
我想他们会听我的

88
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:03,180
You mean you're going to let them take you prisoner?
你的意思是, 你打算过去做他们的囚徒？

89
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,030
That is exactly what I'm going to do.
那正是我要做的

90
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:43,925
I think he's gonna wake.

His fever's gone.

93
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,226
Well, his body is young. It will heal.

94
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,002
Then, why you looking so worried?
那你为什么看起来还这么焦虑＞

95
00:08:56,342 --> 00:09:00,651
I don't know yet. The weapons they used on him - they're curious.
我也不知道, 可能是他们对他使用的那个武器 - 他们很好奇(fixme)

96
00:09:00,846 --> 00:09:03,083
Aye, scientifically designed, of course.
哈, 科学设计, 当然

97
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:04,594
This is no time for debates.
没时间争论了

98
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:07,583
Aye, it's easily said. I'll away and fetch a fresh drink.
是, 说起来倒是容易．我去拿杯水来

What you doing to me?

I don't believe you!
我不相信你

Don't be a fool, Storr. Of course it's not the drugs.
别傻了, Storr, 当然不是药造成的

133
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,743
Well what is it then?

You mean I'm paralysed?

We need her to draw an intelligent being from the base.

00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:06,629
To find out the kind of reactor they use.

There will be floods.

150
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,394
The gun is our only chance.

啊！不, 不要, 求你了！谁来帮帮我, 救命

153
00:12:41,106 --> 00:12:44,434
Well, there's nothing more I can do for him. That's the last of the tranquiliser pads.
唉, 没什么其它手段我可以帮到他了．这已经是最后一剂镇静剂了．

00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:46,927
Do ye... understand his illness?

No, and I've no way of knowing the cause.

To befriend the aliens.

他们会帮我们的, 我去找他们说．他们会理解的

But they're warriors, trained to kill.

Ach, only in self-defense, surely.

163
00:13:04,572 --> 00:13:06,908
Oh rubbish no! We've got to get the boy back to the base.
胡说八道．我们必须得把这小伙子送回基地去

164
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:07,692
No!
不！

165
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:08,840
For the boy's sake.
为了这孩子着想

166

哦, 是了, 你是想设计陷害我．我是不可能回到 Clent 所代表的那个文明世界的, 我就呆在这里

Do you think the aliens are any better? They killed Arden.

Ar, they were afraid.

我还是要去跟他们谈谈, 得有人去

We don't know what they're capable of, or why they're here.
我们不知道他们能做出什么来, 也不知道他们为什么来这里

不, 停！Storr, 你不知道你会碰到什么！

Storr! Storr! Storr! Storr!

Can you hear me! Help! Oh! I'm trapped!
你能听到我吗？救命！我被卡住了！

182
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:48,835
A rather ragged fellow. Like me.

183
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:51,366
No, nobody. Not even like me.
没人, 跟我差不多的都没有

184
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,382
Then I'm too late. There's nothing I can do.

Can I help you?
需要帮忙吗？

186
00:14:56,321 --> 00:15:00,029

你已经帮助过我一次了．你为什么不把我交过去, 或者在基地就阻止我？

187
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,875
Well why should I? I don't believe everything Clent tells me.
为什么我要那样？并不是 Clent 说的每一个字我都信

188
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:06,928
This boy. He's your friend.

You ran away? But why?
你逃跑？为什么？

The warriors - they're evil. They killed Arden. I think they want to destroy the base.
那些寒冰勇士 - 他们很邪恶, 他们杀死了 Arden, 而且他们好像还想毁灭基地

00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,958
They are against the scientists?
他们是跟科学家作对的？

他们不肯听我的, 他们觉得离子器是用来对付他们的武器

201
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,275
Ah, it's true. A weapon of destruction.
也没错．一种破坏性武器

202
00:15:58,449 --> 00:15:59,840

203
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:01,771

Is it ready?

213
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:45,270

我们正在检查操纵杆, 将谐振频率与目标调整到一致

When do we attack the base?

啊, 他们是跟科学家和离子器作对的, 对我来说这就够了

You. What good are you to us?

这要看情况．你的大脑受了惊吓, 影响了你的神经系统

是的我知道这个, 但他一个人没法单独过去

That's the glacier. It's moving forward even faster.
是那些冰山, 它们移动得越来越快了

261
00:19:56,517 --> 00:19:59,013
Alright. I'll help you take him back.
没事, 我会帮助你把他抬回去

262
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:02,924
Well that's just it, you see. I, I can't go, there's something I must do.
目前的情况是, 你看, 我还不能回去, 还有一点事情我必须得干

263
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,118
Well you don't expect me to face Clent alone? That mouth-piece of the computer?
你没指望我单独去面对 Clent 吧？那个电脑传声筒？

264
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,118
He's got a printed circuit where his heart should be!
他的心脏部位只有一个打印电路

265
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:14,755
He's a man with a mission. I don't think he can afford to reject you.
他是一个有使命感的人．我觉得他没法拒绝你, 他承受不了这个

266
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:16,759
Well that's not the point. Anyway, what are you gonna do?
算了不说这个了． 你打算做什么？

267
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,247
I must speak with the warriors.
我必须跟寒冰勇士们谈谈

268
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:19,052
No Doctor!
不要, 博士

269
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:20,242
Well what can you do alone?
你自己一个人能干什么呢？

270
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:28,313
I have to see whether Victoria got away safely, and I must find out whether this
spacecraft is a danger to the ionisation program. I, I admit it won't be easy.
我必须要去看看 Victoria 有没有安全地逃脱, 我也必须弄明白这个飞船对离子项目是否存在危险．我承认这个并不简单

271
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:31,239
Doctor, if you go to the warriors you'll be their prisoner!
博士, 如果你去找他们你会变成他们的囚徒的

272
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:33,608
Their guest I hope, Jamie.
成为他们的客人, 我期望是．

273
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:42,062
Look Miss Garrett, look. The glacier's moving. That's the fifth surge today.
Garrett 小姐你看, 冰山还在你懂, 这是今天的第五次高峰．

274
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:48,062
The ioniser just isn't holding it anymore.
离子器快要撑不住了

275
00:20:49,402 --> 00:20:51,522
But we daren't increase power beyond the minimal.
但我们不敢让功率超过最小值

276
00:20:53,502 --> 00:21:02,219
Well I know the risk if the spaceship explodes. _ radioactivity
level. We'd only replace one disaster with an even greater one.
我知道飞船爆炸的话风险有多大, ？辐射量．我们只是将灾难换成了一个更大的灾难

277
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:04,473
But you must make a decision soon.
但你必须尽快做出一个抉择

278
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:11,084
No decision to be made yet! Computer can act only when given adequate information.
暂时还不需要抉择．必须要给出足够的信息, 电脑才能做出判断．

279
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:14,584
We still don't know enough about the alien reactor.
我们对于外星人反应器的情况还了解得不够

280
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,826
Suppose we never know? Suppose the Doctor never returns?
假设我们不可能搞清楚呢？假设博士不可能返回呢？

281
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,830
We'll face that if and when we have to.
当且仅当那个时候我们再来面对这个问题

282
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:27,437
But you must have a plan in mind, surely?
但你肯定心里已经有计划了, 对吧？

283
00:21:28,707 --> 00:21:34,048
I'm pinning all my hopes on the Doctor. He must succeed.
我把所有的期望都寄托在博士身上了, 他必须成功

284
00:21:34,236 --> 00:21:36,861
Here we go, Clent old chap. Wish me luck.
我们走吧, Clent 老家伙, 祝我好运

285
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,530
Anyone at home?
有谁在吗？

286
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:40,244
Open up. Come on, open up, I say! Very well, I shall count to ten. One... two... three... ah!
开门, 快啊, 开们． 好, 我数到十．一．．．二．．．三．．．四．．．

287
00:22:45,829 --> 00:22:47,819
Who are you?
你是谁？

288
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:51,383
I never answer questions until I'm addressed properly.
如果不先问侯我的话, 我不回答任何问题

289
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:55,943
You will answer now.
你现在就要回答

290
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:08,568
Very well. You are standing in the airlock of this spacecraft.
很好, 你正站在飞船的减压舱．

291
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:23,568
Unless you answer my questions, within ten seconds I will take atmospheric pressure around you down to zero.
如果你不回答我的问题, 在10秒钟之内我就将你那里的空气压力降到 0

292
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,651
But if you do that my body will explode!
如果那样的话我的身体会爆掉的

293
00:23:27,794 --> 00:23:36,034
One... two... three... four...
一．．．二．．．三．．．四．．．
