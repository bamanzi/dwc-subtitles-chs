00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:12,772
Let me have it. Give it to me at once.
那是什么东西？ 把它给我, 马上把它给我

3
00:01:13,217 --> 00:01:17,239
Zondal. Zondal fire!
Zondal! Zondal 开枪！

4
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:28,736
Fire now! Zondal fire!
Zondal fire! Fire now!
马上开枪！Zondal 开枪！Zondal 开枪！马上开枪！

7
00:01:53,595 --> 00:01:54,501
We're under attack!
我们被攻击了！

8
00:01:57,809 --> 00:01:58,740
Report!
赶紧报告！

9
00:01:59,524 --> 00:02:03,101
Leader Clent, surrender or die!
组长 Clent, 不投降就死

10
00:02:07,314 --> 00:02:08,592
What in the blazes?

11
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:14,348
Surrender now or I will blast your base to fragments.
现在投降, 否则我就把你们的基地轰成齑粉

12
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:17,655
No, I refuse! You can't destroy us!
不, 我拒绝！你们不可能摧毁我们

13
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:25,693
You do not believe me? Very well. Must I fire again?
你不相信？ 好, 必须得我再开一炮？

14
00:02:26,556 --> 00:02:27,697
We must play for time.
我们必须拖延时间

15
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:30,410
The building won't stand much more of this bombardment, Sir!
这栋建筑受不了几次这样的轰击, 先生！

16
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:35,133
Then we must talk. Who am I addressing?
那我们必须谈谈, 我在跟谁对话？

17
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:41,838
My name is Varga. Do you surrender?
我叫 Varga． 你们投降吗？

18
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:51,068
Now frankly, you gain nothing by destroying us, Varga. We both
have urgent needs. I will agree to talk... but nothing more.
坦白地说, 毁灭我们你们什么也得不到, Varga.

19
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:58,451
No treachery? If I come in peace
there must be trust between us.

20
00:02:58,632 --> 00:03:00,934
Very well. There will be
no traps, or conditions.

21
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:05,675
See that you keep to
that, for if you lie...

22
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:13,681
What does he want?

23
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:16,062
Our guards won't stand a chance
against weapons like that, Sir.

24
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:20,810
Ah, you heard what he said
- no treachery, only trust.

25
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:22,650
But can we trust him?

26
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:27,229
I'm afraid we have to. He's got the best argument on his side
- that gun, or whatever it is.

27
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:29,385
We can bluff him though.

28
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:30,995
How?

29
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:37,183
He doesn't know the computer's command to wait. We can
threaten to destroy the glacier, and his ship with it.

30
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,428
Yes, yes. Yes possibly.

31
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:42,201
Well why can't we do it, Sir?
It's our only chance for survival!

32
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:44,427
Because you know the computers decision
- and its reasons.

33
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:47,572
I know all about that! But it doesn't
exactly give much thought to us, does it?

34
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,243
The computer thinks of everything,
considers all the facts.

35
00:03:50,401 --> 00:04:02,864
And it's supposed to come up with all the answers, isn't it? Well a fat lot of good it's doing us now! Wait,
it says, wait! With glaciers on the one hand, and, and warriors on the other! Well what price your computer now!

36
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:03,888
Walters!

37
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:19,049
What we need, is, is someone like, like Penley, or that Doctor! Someone who can think! Not with a machine! And what
good's your precious computer done anyway? Nothing! Nothing but trouble! And it's time somebody put a stop to it!

38
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:30,992
That's Varga's voice.

39
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:34,593
We are going in now.

40
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:36,082
We must escape.

41
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:45,335
It's not just a question of escape, Victoria. We've got to take some action.
Right, this gun that's given Varga control of the base, without it he'd be helpless.

42
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,960
What can we do?

43
00:04:56,527 --> 00:05:08,368
Well now, gentlemen, you, you said no traps. And we for
our part, have made utterly sure, that there are no traps...

44
00:05:08,905 --> 00:05:14,630
I made no promises. I merely
warned you not to trick me.

45
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:16,094
How can we help you?

46
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:21,111
I will tell you what I want
and you will give it to me.

47
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:34,547
Oh, come now Varga, that's not the way to talk. We're, both of us, in a very difficult situation. Under
times like this it beholds us both to proceed with mutual respect and, because the whole world could be...

48
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:48,793
So much for your word.

49
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:53,107
That was, that was not planned.

50
00:05:53,309 --> 00:06:05,415
I have one major requirement: the mercury isotopes
for my ships reactor. You will give them to me.

51
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:07,543
But we don't use mercury isotopes.

52
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:11,027
The Doctor stated
that you had them here.

53
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,405
Well he was wrong, we have none.

54
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,227
You are lying.

55
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:16,020
What good will it do me?

56
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:24,812
Tell me what will happen if we halted your reactor
in order to remove the fuel elements we need.

57
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,060
You can't do that!

58
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:26,985
Why?

59
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:29,043
That reactor gives us
light, heat and power.

60
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:30,443
And it powers the ioniser.

61
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,479
So that without it, you
would be completely helpless.

62
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:39,604
In Arctic conditions like
these... we'd soon perish.

63
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:42,795
Where as we would not.

64
00:06:43,013 --> 00:06:46,526
You'd be wasting your time. This
reactor does not use mercury.

65
00:06:46,755 --> 00:06:49,841
I do not believe you.

66
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,003
But you must.

67
00:06:53,251 --> 00:07:01,997
There is only one way to find out. Where
are the reactor controls? Tell me now.

68
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:05,565
Did you hear that? Making
them shut down the reactor!

69
00:07:05,755 --> 00:07:10,453
Yes. Now this is Varga's main weapon. There's
just a chance that I can turn it against him.

70
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:11,413
What?

71
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:15,423
If I can open these doors...
there we are! Come on.

72
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:19,901
Now careful. Just stay there.

73
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:22,666
How does this gun operate?

74
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:24,665
Oh, hurry Doctor, hurry.

75
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,848
You've got to believe me!

76
00:07:27,105 --> 00:07:29,058
So you say.

77
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:44,171
Listen, Varga, the power source is locked in directly with the ioniser. Now if we cut the
power before it is safe, the feedback effect could blast this building into a state of ion flux.

78
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:57,487
What's its temperature range?

79
00:07:57,669 --> 00:07:59,500
It can melt rock!

80
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,400
Don't interfere with
it! It's fully primed.

81
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:08,156
It can melt rock. What a weapon.

82
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:10,719
It is not a weapon. It is
a scientific instrument.

83
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:13,524
I see it differently.

84
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:15,806
It's still a highly dangerous machine.

85
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:22,878
Then run is carefully down to
safety level. But no tricks.

86
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:27,027
You do it now.

87
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:34,599
It will take some time.

88
00:08:34,823 --> 00:08:39,417
Doesn't matter. You
dare not use it anyway.

89
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:41,571
What?

90
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:53,764
Your Doctor friend talked. I know your fear of my
spaceship. That it will explode if the heat is too great.

91
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:56,711
Would it?

92
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:05,774
Close it down. Or you die.

93
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:08,893
She's the only person qualified
to disconnect the ioniser safely.

94
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,518
What are you qualifications
for existence?

95
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,745
I'm the leader here!

96
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:25,435
You have less value to me than your
colleague, who has certain skills.

97
00:09:25,672 --> 00:09:29,935
But she doesn't know everything. I
have the answers that you require.

98
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:39,392
I know all I need to know. If I killed
you, it would be no great loss to me.

99
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:40,551
No! Please!

100
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:54,774
Then you will do as I say. Run down the machine as
quickly as is safely possible. No more tricks. At once.

101
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:02,420
Ah, ah.

102
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:03,780
What is it you're trying to do?

103
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:09,617
Well it's a little difficult to explain,
Victoria. Oh. Oh dear. Hold this for me, will you?

104
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:17,771
Ah. This gun works on the basis that sound waves
produce reverberations in the objects in their path.

105
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:22,488
The objects vibrate in sympathy.
Well I know, my father told me once.

106
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:26,675
Yes, that's right. Well if you can produce
unsympathetic vibrations, damage results.

107
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,577
Damage? Oh, like a
singer breaking glass.

108
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:38,431
Yes. But I want to be able to get at the warriors without it affecting
the scientists too much. Now, if we change this to frequency seven...

109
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:39,629
What will that do?

110
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:41,321
Well primarily it affects fluids.

111
00:10:41,465 --> 00:10:42,789
What good is that to us?

112
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:48,733
Well I believe that Varga and his warriors have a
far greater fluid content than human-beings. There.

113
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,429
If it works, what happens?

114
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:54,767
That's just it, I don't know.

115
00:10:54,924 --> 00:10:55,807
Oh now look, Doctor.

116
00:10:55,937 --> 00:11:00,221
But I do know that whatever effect it has on the
scientists, it'll have a far greater one on the warriors.

117
00:11:00,474 --> 00:11:01,318
Well how's that?

118
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:05,437
Well apart from the fluid question, their
helmets will trap and intensify the sound waves.

119
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:09,782
You mean, it'll knock them out and leave
the scientists a bit dizzy? Well is that it?

120
00:11:09,944 --> 00:11:15,847
Well that's what I'm hoping, but, there is just a vague
risk that it'll kill everybody. Clent and Penley included.

121
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:19,760
And Jamie?

122
00:11:51,615 --> 00:11:52,334
It's done.

123
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:54,399
It is safe now?

124
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:02,028
Yes. Just ticking over. Not even
holding the ice in check at all.

125
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:06,180
Disconnect it completely, now.

126
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:16,544
Now we must move quickly, before the
glacial surge does too much damage.

127
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:17,996
You'll regret this, Varga.

128
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:27,579
At least I will live to regret it.
Now, the reactor. Shut it down, quickly.

129
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:42,714
Perfectly at home in ice age conditions.
Well, we'll soon change all that.

130
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:52,996
Shut it down at once.

131
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:55,172
Ooh.

132
00:12:55,425 --> 00:13:24,540
The heat. What is happening? There is something wrong.
You are trying to trick me again. For that you will die!

133
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:26,381
No no! It's too dangerous!

134
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:28,323
It's a risk we must take, Victoria!

135
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:28,961
Oh!

136
00:13:29,127 --> 00:13:31,571
Now, cross your fingers. Here we go.

137
00:13:51,749 --> 00:14:10,888
Varga, this is the Doctor. Are you going to retreat, or shall I fire again? Trouble is I dare not use it again,
if it hasn't killed them all already, another firing most certainly will! Varga! Answer me or I fire again!

138
00:14:12,745 --> 00:14:16,470
You will die for this.

139
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,241
What are you doing now?

140
00:14:21,414 --> 00:14:22,604
Get well back, Victoria.

141
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:23,539
What?

142
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:25,689
Stand by for fireworks! Here we go.

143
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:30,228
Now quickly! Let's get out
of here before they come back!

144
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,440
The gun is useless.

145
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:59,362
Victoria, see if you can find Jamie.

146
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:05,795
Doctor, Jamie's in there. He's alive!

147
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,350
Well thanks heavens for that! Now you get
back to the TARDIS, and close the doors!

148
00:15:18,978 --> 00:15:19,764
Sorry about that.

149
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:20,786
Oh.

150
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:23,339
Up you get. Come along. Ah.

151
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,245
What happened? Did you do that?

152
00:15:30,423 --> 00:15:31,715
No time for questions. Come along.

153
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,982
So, you allowed them to trick you.

154
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:47,351
I await your punishment, Commander.

155
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:59,964
We have no time. Everything depends on being ready to
break free from the ice as soon as they evaporate it.

156
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,768
Up you get. Come along
Miss Garrett. There you are.

157
00:16:03,987 --> 00:16:06,647
Clent. The Doctor did something, but
don't ask me what it was. Are you alright?

158
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,157
Oh, the ioniser! They
made me... disconnect it!

159
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:10,066
Then it must be switched
on again immediately!

160
00:16:10,245 --> 00:16:11,412
I don't take orders from you!

161
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:20,121
Miss Garrett, if we are to obey Computer
Control, it must be reconnected. Do so please.

162
00:16:20,622 --> 00:16:21,724
Yes, of course.

163
00:16:21,926 --> 00:16:26,284
Clent! Their spacecraft is
powered by an ion reactor.

164
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:33,932
Well that means we dare not use the ioniser
at full force. That's our last chance gone.

165
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,268
Why, for heavens sake?

166
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,778
Because of the risk, man!
You know what would happen.

167
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:41,543
Of course there's a risk, but it's a
risk we must take! It's the only way!

168
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:42,470
Exactly!

169
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:43,447
The computer says no!

170
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:44,236
The computer...

171
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:47,323
Is our supreme advisor.

172
00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:49,491
And what sort of advice
is that? Do nothing?

173
00:16:49,657 --> 00:16:50,528
We must obey!

174
00:16:50,863 --> 00:16:52,629
And be destroyed? Has the
computer considered that?

175
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,570
The computer considers everything.

176
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:57,324
But that's why in this case you
cannot rely on its judgement!

177
00:16:57,485 --> 00:17:00,561
We trust the computer! It is
our strength and our guide.

178
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:01,503
Not this time!

179
00:17:01,643 --> 00:17:02,349
Well why not?

180
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:10,284
Because Jamie, the computer is faced with an insoluble problem. Either
way it risks destroying itself and this it cannot do. It must play safe.

181
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:12,054
Aye, but if it does
nothing that's just as bad.

182
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,494
I'll explain to you another time, Jamie.

183
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:16,696
There's only one way out.

184
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:17,345
What?

185
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:18,780
We must override the computer.

186
00:17:18,947 --> 00:17:20,892
You can't do that!

187
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:31,915
We must. This is a decision for a man to take, not a machine. The computer isn't
designed to take risks, but that is the essence of mans procrease. We must decide.

188
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:41,953
But if you do that soon ruin the world plan! All the ioniser bases must act together!
Through World Computer Control! If we act too soon it's as bad as being too late!

189
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:49,376
Yes I know that, but the other bases haven't got a glacier right on top of them, and apart
from that, what about these ice warriors? If they live, they threaten our entire civilisation.

190
00:17:49,547 --> 00:17:52,319
A decision must be taken, and quickly!

191
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:55,680
I can't.

192
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:04,444
I daren't.

193
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:06,615
Penley, it's up to you.

194
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,458
Well Clent?

195
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,726
I reserve the right to
consult the computer.

196
00:18:13,902 --> 00:18:14,728
Go ahead.

197
00:18:14,945 --> 00:18:24,179
Problem: alien spacecraft is powered by an ion reactor.
Dare we use the ioniser? What are the alternatives? Answer.

198
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,751
It's as though it's gone mad!

199
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:32,988
Well Penley?

200
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:42,299
We will use the ioniser at full strength to turn back
the glacier. Miss, Miss Garrett, inform World Control.

201
00:18:42,796 --> 00:18:46,472
Er, but the spaceship, if
you release it from the ice?

202
00:18:47,404 --> 00:18:49,707
At full strength the
ioniser will melt rock!

203
00:18:53,779 --> 00:19:02,418
Commander, the glacier is
breaking up. Soon we will be free.

204
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:12,895
What use is our freedom if we are
helpless? Our engines must still dead.

205
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,093
I have not given up yet.

206
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,048
Nor I. There must be some
life left in the elements.

207
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:24,840
Commander, power.

208
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:34,846
What? The ice is our
friend. We still have power.

209
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:37,198
Shall I increase it?

210
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:44,964
Carefully. We must time full
take-off boost perfectly.

211
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:52,368
And when we are free and in
flight, we will be invincible.

212
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:01,569
Instrument readings on the glacier face show a
steady rise in temperature. Now near to maximum.

213
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:02,878
Well how will we know?

214
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:10,909
The instruments on the ice face have the highest heat _ resistance known to
man. When they cease to function, everything about them will be destroyed.

215
00:20:15,693 --> 00:20:19,270
You're wrong! You're
wrong! We'll all be killed!

216
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:21,683
It is a risk I willingly take!

217
00:20:27,291 --> 00:21:00,279
It was not power in the engines, Zondal, it was heat, our
greatest enemy! The heat from the ioniser! The... heeeeeeeeeat...!

218
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:31,199
Only a minor explosion.

219
00:21:31,705 --> 00:21:33,202
We're safe!

220
00:21:34,008 --> 00:21:35,640
Oh. Goodness me!

221
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:53,174
Set all circuits to automatic, Miss Garrett. And tie in with the World loniser instrumentation.
Clent, will you, er, check these readings with me? And you've a report to prepare haven't you?

222
00:21:55,059 --> 00:22:17,147
Yes, yes, yes I have. Penley. You are the most insufferably irritating
and infuriating person, I've ever been privileged to work with.

223
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:18,105
Thank you.

224
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:29,959
Can't write a report though, can you? Something I've got to do for
you. Well don't worry it's something that I've been trained to do.

225
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:31,251
Without the computer?

226
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:44,348
No Penley. I've always written my
own speeches, and my own reports.

227
00:22:45,228 --> 00:22:49,533
Are you going to include...
Well where's the Doctor?
