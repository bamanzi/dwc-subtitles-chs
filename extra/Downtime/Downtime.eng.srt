- The first alien force I
ever came up against. - Sir?

The Great Intelligence.

And?

373
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,918
No physical shape of its own,
so it enslaved humans as pawns.

374

And it deployed a squad of strategic
robots camouflaged like Yeti.

Was this in Tibet, sir?

376

No. London, about 25 years ago.

377
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,749

as its nervous system.

up to town today?

502
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,872
Information, sir,

503
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,874
of a personal nature, you understand?

504

505
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,789

into security files in Geneva.

forthcoming about dealings with UNIT.

more personal details.

about this, too?

Strange you never rose
above Brigadier, wasn't it?

Internal politics.

00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,157

for my memoirs.

You must've picked up
the odd souvenir in your time.

519
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,196
I counted them in
and I counted them all back out.

520
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,914
No particular keepsake?

521
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,713
I mean, things do get mislaid.

522

If you lose things,
you could lose men, too.

523
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,676
Well, it's been good to talk to you,
Cavendish, but I have another appointment.

524
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,440
So soon? I was concerned, Brigadier.

525
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,676
- So was I
- CAVENDISH: So you should be.

527
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,194
Now back off.

528
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,160
I'm leaving.

529
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,559
Get after him!

530
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,594
It's not too late!

531
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,998
I must find it.

All right then.
Quote them the codes, NN and then QQ.

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,837
It's a risk, but we must reach
someone we can trust.

I'd get more sense
from a tea lady. Sorry.

542
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,072
May I ask if you've encountered
anything resembling a Yeti?

543
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,430
- Have I encountered any what?
- A Yeti.

544
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,471
What have Yeti got to do with it?

545
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,477
- You're late.
- I was delayed.

- Oh, I can't complain.

How are you?

549

Look, this is stupid.

550
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,314
I'll just go. I shouldn't have called you.

551
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,558

We could get a meal.

You look tired.

556
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,199
I've had a difficult morning.

557
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,990
Kate, it's been six years.

558
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,315
What's the matter? Is it money?

559
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,794
No, no. Not especially.

560
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,594
- Your mother then?
- No! I don't see her either.

- I'm being harassed.
- Who by?

- There are these Chillys.
- Chillys?

- You know? Children...

00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,509
Two of them.

567
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,551
They just sit
opposite the boat all the time.

- Look, I'm being stupid.
- No.

569

But they just won't go away.

570

You have lit a flame of hope in all of us.

What's his name? Doesn't he help?

585
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,591
I split up with Jonathan two years ago.

586
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,119
I'm sorry.

587
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,833
I'm getting old.

588
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,473
Perhaps you should get off that boat.

589
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,398
It's not the boat. It's them!

590
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,792
- And me too?
- Well,

591
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,194
army families get to live together,
so why didn't we?

592
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,118
Was your career that important?

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,035
I'm afraid I can't explain, Kate.

594
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,674
Mum used to think that
you were some sort of spy.

We used to hope it, because at
least that would be interesting.

call first, police or psychiatrist?

I'm the trap!

I'm warning you, Hinton, stand back!
