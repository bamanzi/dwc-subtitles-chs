The door, it's locked!

00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:52,676
-They're depressurising.
-Listen.

5
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:56,119
Don't you understand, man!
They're pumping out the air!

6
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:59,677
-We're, we're going to suffocate!
-Of course we're not.

7
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:04,442
That's no good.
They...they'll never hear us.

8
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:07,360
Well, they certainly won't
if we don't try.

00:01:07,687 --> 00:01:09,882
DALE: Help! Help! Help!

00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:13,164
Professor, don't shout!
You'll just waste oxygen.

11
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:21,644
Come on, Professor, come on.
Come on, up you get.

Listen! Listen, it worked!

14
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:45,241
I do hope that you're all right, Doctor.

15
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:46,840
(SIGHING) You...

16
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,838
Yes, I might have guessed.

17
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:52,805
I'd hate you to come
to any harm, you know?

18
00:01:56,287 --> 00:02:00,075
It was a deliberate attempt
at cold-blooded murder, Governor.

19
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:01,998
And I demand an enquiry.

20
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:04,043
You were trying to escape.

21
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:06,402
You've only yourselves to blame
for the consequences.

22
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:09,206
I also believe there was a conspiracy
to destroy this man

23
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:10,925
because he's politically dangerous
to you.

24
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:12,122
How dare you!

25
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:14,004
Cross said he would help us to escape

26
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:16,043
and he left spacesuits for us
in the airlock.

27
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,402
With no oxygen in the cylinders.

28
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:19,840
Is there any truth in this?

29
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:21,246
No, sir. They stole the suits.

30
00:02:21,327 --> 00:02:23,522
Must have messed it up
and taken ones with empty cylinders.

31
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:26,167
And I take it that we also locked
ourselves in the air lock

32
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,920
from the outside,
and switched off the air supply, mmm?

33
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:31,123
He does have a point there, you know,
Governor. Had it not been...

34
00:02:31,207 --> 00:02:34,279
Maybe another prisoner did it.
You know, one who had it in for 'em?

35
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:37,245
You are both guilty
of attempting to escape.

36
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:40,285
You will both be placed in solitary
confinement for the next year.

37
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:43,200
Uh,just a moment, Governor.
Do what you will with the old man,

38
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:45,676
but that one comes with me.

39
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,803
Out of the question, I'm afraid.

40
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:52,324
He has committed an internal offence
and is subject to prison discipline.

41
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:54,086
Take them away.

42
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:04,643
Sorry about this, sir.
I'll see it doesn't happen again.

43
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:08,119
Yes, it had better not.
All right, you can go.

44
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:09,322
Sir.

45
00:03:11,247 --> 00:03:14,364
You know, I do wish
that you'd reconsider, Governor.

46
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:17,166
Obtaining custody of that prisoner
is very important to me.

47
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:19,124
And I do have a warrant.

48
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:21,038
It's out of the question, I'm afraid.

49
00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:23,277
You see, he is under punishment.

50
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:26,996
When he's completed his solitary
confinement, I'll reconsider.

51
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:28,315
I see.

52
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:32,964
You know, I have a theory
about this incident.

53
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,083
It's no concern of yours.

54
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:38,762
I think that those two prisoners
were telling the truth.

55
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:42,360
I think that your trusty Cross
was helping them.

56
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:44,278
Why should he do that?

57
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:46,760
On your instructions.

58
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:50,283
-That is an outrageous suggestion...
-Oh, come, Governor!

59
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:52,881
You rid yourself
of a politically dangerous prisoner

60
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:56,516
and foster the legend
that escape is impossible in one go.

61
00:03:56,607 --> 00:03:57,676
I must congratulate you.

62
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,246
You're being very impertinent!

63
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:03,320
Suppose I were to support the Doctor's
demand for an official enquiry?

64
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:05,602
Some very awkward questions
could be asked.

65
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:08,281
-I have nothing to fear.
-Haven't you?

66
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:13,400
Oh, come, Governor.
Hand the Doctor over to me

67
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:17,243
and I promise you
he'll be no further trouble to you.

68
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:22,924
Well, I've no wish to be uncooperative.
What would you do with him?

69
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, take him back to Sirius 4
and see that he stands trial.

70
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:30,160
(EXCLAIMING) You wouldn't believe
the list of crimes he's committed.

71
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:43,445
I'm releasing you into the custody
of this commissioner.

72
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:46,678
He will fly you back to Sirius 4
to stand trial.

73
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:49,407
And may I ask
what I'm supposed to have done there?

that he's shown you are forged.

up. Why not admit defeat?

-Hello, Jo.
-Doctor!

-How are you? All right?
-Well...

00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:07,085
Right, they'll be plenty of time

You can leave them to me now.

Well, Doctor,
this is an interesting reversal.

94
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:38,998
I remember your once visiting me
when I was in prison.

95
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:40,566
You know, I'd very much
like to know why...

96
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:41,966
Why you've been locked up?

97
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:44,686
No, why I'm still alive.

98
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:49,722
Oh, come, your health is very precious
to me, for the moment.

99
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:53,285
You see, my employers
are most interested in you.

-The Ogrons?
-Miss Grant, please! I employ them.

101
00:06:57,407 --> 00:07:00,285
Yes, well, whatever it is you're up to,
you needn't expect any help from me.

102
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:01,846
I don't need any help.

103
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:04,361
Your simple presence
will be quite enough.

104
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:08,401
Oh, by the way, I need hardly warn you
there is no point in trying to escape.

105
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:10,398
This is an interplanetary
police spaceship,

106
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:13,240
specially built for carrying prisoners,
as you can see.

107

Stolen, of course?

108
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:17,638
(SCOFFING) Of course.
Oh, and another thing...

109
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:21,319
There's a closed-circuit television
camera trained on you from up there,

110
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,967
so you will be
under continuous observation.

111
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:25,366
I think that's all.

112
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:27,961
Well, now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some rather complicated

113
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,436
astro-navigational calculations
to work out.

114
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:32,245
May I ask where we're going?

115
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,956
Certainly. To the home of our friends,
the Ogrons.

116
00:07:36,487 --> 00:07:40,002
A barren and uninteresting planet
on the remote fringes of the galaxy.

117
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:41,725
Why are you taking us there?

118
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:45,117
That, Miss Grant,
you will discover when you arrive.

119
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:51,597
Right, now listen to me.
We haven't got much time

120
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:53,325
before he gets back to the flight deck.

121
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,762
Now, the first thing
we've got to do is to escape.

122
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:58,202
Now, they took my sonic screwdriver
from me in the prison

123
00:07:58,287 --> 00:08:00,755
but they didn't get a hold of this.

124
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,964
-A steel file.
-Right, let's go.

125
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:06,197
No, not yet. Let's wait
till he gets back to the flight deck,

126
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:09,597
then he'll set the controls.
Now, this is an automatic spaceship.

127
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:12,042
Once we're underway,
the computers take over, right?

128
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:14,083
-Okay, so what's the plan?
-Now this is what we're gonna do.

that was my business.

137

What about stealing the TARDIS?

138
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:42,761
I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it.

139
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:45,077
I fully intended to return it,
I assure you.

I tell you, I made a complete fool
of that prosecuting council, though.

143
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:54,042
I ridiculed his every argument.

144
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,277
Yes, and I told him

DOCTOR: Then what happened, well,
they found me guilty,

148
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:04,886
changed my appearance

155
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:21,202
<i>After all, I am a Time Lord,Jo,</i>

156
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,359
-JO: <i>Right!</i>
-In reminiscent mood, are you, Doctor?

157
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:26,756
Poor Miss Grant,
you have my deepest sympathy.

158
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:28,200
(CHUCKLING)

159
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:39,122
As I soon realised,
the trouble with Lethbridge-Stewart

160
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:40,606
is that he's got a military mind.

161
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:43,724
Well, he is a brigadier, after all.
I mean, what do you expect?

162
00:10:43,807 --> 00:10:44,876
No, that's just the trouble though.

163
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:48,323
He's hidebound, you see.
He always does everything by the rules.

164
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:50,079
I keep telling him.
I said, "There are times, you know,

165
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:52,601
"when you've simply got to cut
right through the red tape."

166
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:54,643
And you've managed to do that, have you?

167
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:57,958
DOCTOR: Yes, I've managed to cut
right through it.

168
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:03,846
And I'm not going to let authority
stand between me and my freedom.

169
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:08,320
(SIGHING) Lethbridge-Stewart, I...

170
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:13,083
Hey! As far as he's concerned I've been
absent without leave all this time.

171
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,197
I'm always telling people
that you've no idea

172
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:18,562
where you're going
in that TARDIS of yours.

173
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:21,036
I mean, you're supposed to be getting me
back to Earth, right?

174
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:24,802
And we keep landing up in one
terrible situation after the other.

175
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:28,163
I mean, when I get back,
I'll probably be court-martialled

176
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:31,683
and then I'll be put in a cell again.
That's if we do get back,

177
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:34,235
and the way things are going,
it doesn't look like it.

178
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,797
But if we do get back, I'm telling you
one thing, right here and now...

179
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,560
I'm never going up in that TARDIS
with you again.

180
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:43,081
But if we do get back,
I really think you ought to be

181
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,237
a bit more reasonable with the Master.

182
00:11:45,327 --> 00:11:49,718
I mean, he keeps offering you a share
in the galaxy, or whatever's going on,

183
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:53,004
and you keep refusing him
and playing dirty tricks on him.

184
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,601
But, you see,
the trouble is with you is,

185
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:57,962
well, you're so stiff-necked.

186
00:11:58,047 --> 00:12:00,561
I mean,
you've got to realise that, this time,

187
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:02,239
the Master has won.

188
00:12:02,327 --> 00:12:05,603

189
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:08,326

<i>Goodness knows where he's taking us to.</i>

192
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:18,756
<i>I mean,just a few of those Ogrons</i>
<i>is bad enough.</i>

193
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:21,441
<i>Can you imagine, I mean imagine,</i>
<i>a whole planet of them?</i>

194
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:31,405
Still, I suppose it's all my own
fault really.

195
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:35,685
I mean, if I hadn't asked my uncle to
pull those strings and get me that job,

196
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:38,964
I'd never have landed up in this mess
in the first place.

197
00:12:39,047 --> 00:12:43,438
You know, some people think that it's
very romantic working in intelligence.

198
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:45,722
Oh, but, my goodness,
I could tell you it's not.

199
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,923
I mean, they think that I run
around all day

200
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:52,478
with a terrific-looking James Bond star
going to suave dinner parties.

201
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:56,484
Oh, but I don't, you know.
I mean, I dine with the Brigadier

202
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,401
and I'm doing the filing at HQ,
which is very, very difficult,

203
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:04,196
or else I'm running around making tea
and being general dogsbody.

204
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:06,881
I mean, the time's come,

Yes, I can quite understand.

No ill effects, I hope?

Uh, yes, I'm most apologetic about that,

Uh, here is my warrant of authority.

Now, don't believe this man, he's lying.

I'm not concerned in disputes
between Earthmen.

273
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:44,561
Owing to the many insults and outrages

274
00:20:44,647 --> 00:20:47,320
committed against the empire
of Draconia,

275

a state of emergency exists

276

and all diplomatic relations
have been severed.

277
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:59,485
You have violated Draconian space.
The penalty is death.

278
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:02,842
I insist on speaking
to higher authority!

279

You are in Draconian space.
I am the authority here.

Captain, you cannot condemn us
without a trial.

281
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:11,722
Now, I have vital information
for your Emperor.

At least give me the chance
to speak to him?

We shall take them to Draconia.

But you can't do that!

I'm a commissioner

This is my spaceship!
I tell you, you can't do that!

Well, personally I'm quite happy
to be going to Draconia, Jo.

288
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:39,960
Perhaps we can convince the Emperor

00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:41,685
what our friend here
has been trying to do.

290

You really think he'd believe you?

291
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,600
Well, this won't be my first visit
to Draconia, you know?

292
00:21:46,687 --> 00:21:49,360
Many years ago,
I spent quite some time there.

293
00:21:49,447 --> 00:21:52,120
I was able to help them through a period
of very great difficulty.

(SCOFFING) Displaying your usual
sickening lovability, I suppose?

295
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:58,317
So there's a good chance
that they'll believe you, huh?

296
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:00,716
Well, it was a long time ago.
Things may have changed.

297
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:02,718
But I do understand
the Draconian mentality, Jo.

298
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:04,445
It all depends how you approach them.

299
00:22:04,527 --> 00:22:07,837
So, if they do believe the Doctor,
you've had it!

300
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,122

But one never knows
when help may be at hand.

302
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:15,802
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I think that this is going to be

303
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:20,165
rather a long journey,
so, uh, good night.

304
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:23,476
We'll wake you with a cup of tea
in the morning.

305
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:24,886
Thank you.
