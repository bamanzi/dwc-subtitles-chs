(BEEPING)

3
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:09,645
DOCTOR: Well, that's it, then.

4
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:11,558
Come on, we've landed.

5
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:14,923
Oh, hadn't we better wake our cellmate?

6
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:17,680
(CHUCKLING) He's awake already.

7
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:19,723
He's just trying to show us
how unconcerned he is.

8
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,559
(MASTER LAUGHING)

9
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:24,400
How well you know me, Doctor!

10
00:02:24,487 --> 00:02:26,205
Now, come on, smarten yourselves up.

11
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:28,721
We want to look our best
for a royal audience, you know.

12
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:30,559
He's very confident.

13
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:33,639
Well, Miss Grant,
as an Earth poet once said,

14
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:37,037
"My strength is as the strength of ten,
because my heart is pure."
<i> (Alfred Tennyson,Â Sir Galahad, st. 1  1842).</i>

15
00:02:37,127 --> 00:02:41,279
Come on, you fellows, let me out.
Your Emperor is waiting to see me.

16
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:57,356
So, Father, once more
Earthmen have invaded our space.

17
00:02:57,447 --> 00:03:01,156
You will address the Emperor
in a proper manner.

18
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,396
Your pardon.

19
00:03:02,487 --> 00:03:05,445
May I have permission
to address the Emperor?

20
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:09,925
My life at your command.

21
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:13,716
One day, my Son,
you will inherit this throne.

22
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:17,800
Then you will realise
the importance of due formality.

23
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:20,685
Now, what do you wish to say?

24
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:24,203
Surely, now you will declare war
upon the Earthmen?

25
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,437
Let me lead your battle fleets
to crush their...

26
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:29,087
They too, have battle fleets, my Son.

27
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,000
Such a war could
well bring down both empires.

28
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,238
Not if we strike first,
then we shall be the victors!

29
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:38,763
In such a war, there are no victors.

30
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:41,600
The nobles of the court
are demanding action.

31
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,678
They fear for the honour of Draconia.

32
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:49,205
I am the emperor!
The honour of Draconia is vested in me.

33
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:53,200
The throne depends upon
the great families for support.

34
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:56,006
Emperors have been deposed before now.

35
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:59,841
An emperor who does not rule
deposes himself!

36
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,798
Then what will you do, Father?

37
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:05,845
I shall question these Earthmen myself.

38
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:07,963
I have already sent for them.

39
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,720
Why waste time listening to their lies?

40
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:20,364
Majesty, I bring the prisoners.

41
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:23,965
May I have permission
to address the Emperor?

42
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:25,476
Wait!

43
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:27,285
This is an insult!

44
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,803
My life at your command, sire.

45
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:34,445
How dare you address the Emperor

46
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,597
in a manner reserved
for a noble of Draconia?

47
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:38,882
Ah, but I am a noble of Draconia.

48
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:41,197
The honour was conferred on me
by the 15th Emperor.

49
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:45,439
The 15th Emperor reigned 500 years ago.

50
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:46,596
(LAUGHING)

51
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:51,158
Your Majesty, do not be taken
in by this ridiculous story...

52
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:52,760
Be silent!

53
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,399
There is a legend
among our people of a man

54
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:58,718
who assisted the 15th Emperor
at a time of great trouble

55
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:04,165
when we were almost overwhelmed
by a great plague from outer space.

56
00:05:04,247 --> 00:05:09,844
But you could not be that man.
No Earthman lives so long.

57
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:12,487
Your Majesty,
this man that you speak of,

58
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,444
was he not known as the Doctor?

59
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:18,438
And did he not come to this planet
in a spaceship called the TARDIS?

60
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,846
He did.

61
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:21,963
Well, I am that man, sire.

62
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:25,684
And I come from a race of people
that live far longer than any Earthman.

63
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:29,362
Even if I accept your claim,
you have broken our law.

64
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:32,837
Why did you violate Draconian space?

65
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:36,078
Your Majesty, this man was,
and still is, my prisoner.

66
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:37,839
It is true, Your Majesty.

67
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:41,158
I did come here as a prisoner,
but I came willingly,

68
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,363
in order to inform you that
this man is plotting a war

69
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:44,721
between Earth and Draconia!

70
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:46,957
All Earthmen are determined upon war.

71
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,607
Ah, but the Master is not an Earthman.

72
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:52,838
I'm sorry to have to admit it,
but he's a renegade of my own race

73
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:55,521
and he's using creatures called Ogrons

74
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:57,802
to attack your spaceships
and those of the Earthmen.

75
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,720
The Earthmen who attacked
our spaceships,

76
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,843
they have been seen many times.

77
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:04,918
I'm sorry,
but there you are in error, sir.

78
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:06,918
Your people have seen Ogrons,

79
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:09,999
but they appear to them as Earthmen
because of a hypnotic device.

80
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:11,645
It's true, Your Majesty.

81
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:13,797
When the Ogrons attacked
the Earth ships,

82
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:16,037
the Earthmen saw them as Draconians.

83
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:19,483
Silence! Females are not permitted
to speak in the presence of the Emperor.

84
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:23,446
Your Majesty, do not be deceived
by the pathetic ravings

85
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:25,802
of two criminals
trying to evade justice.

86
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:29,641
If what you say is true,
it would explain much.

87
00:06:29,727 --> 00:06:32,287
We lived at peace with the Earthmen
for many years,

88
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:35,404
then suddenly they began
to raid our spaceships.

89
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:38,843
When we protested,
they said that we were attacking them.

90
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:40,883
In order to cover up their own attacks!

91
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:45,245
This is simply a plot of the Earthmen
to lull us into false security.

92
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:49,196
Speak!

93
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:51,518
Your Majesty, a spaceship from Earth

94
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:54,201
seeks permission to land
in the palace spaceport.

95
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:57,438
They say they're on a special mission
from the President of Earth.

96
00:06:57,527 --> 00:06:59,563
This is a trick!
You must not allow them to land!

97
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:01,922
We are not yet at war with Earth.

98
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:05,079
I shall hear what
their president has to say.

99
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,725
I give my permission.

100
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:08,240
Your Majesty.

101
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,363
A wise decision, Your Majesty.

102
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:12,278
For only by Earth and Draconia
working together

103
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,358
can we hope to arrive at the truth.

104
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:16,836
I, too, welcome your wisdom,
Your Majesty.

105
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:20,044
Nobody could be more devoted
to the cause of peace than I.

106
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:22,243
As a commissioner of Earth's
Interplanetary Police,

107
00:07:22,327 --> 00:07:25,524
I have devoted my life
to the cause of law and order.

108
00:07:25,607 --> 00:07:28,644
And law and order can only exist
in a time of peace.

109
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:30,877
You feeling all right, old chap?

110
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:33,686
Only during a period
of social stability,

111
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:36,600
can society adequately
deal with criminals

112
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,279
such as this man
and this unfortunate girl.

(HYPNOTIC PULSE SOUNDING)

114
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:42,001
Doctor, listen! That sound!

115
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:44,195
PRINCE: Silence, female!

116
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:45,515
Quiet!

117
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:48,644
It's the same noise
that I heard on the cargo ship.

118
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:49,921
Doctor, it's the Ogrons!

119
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:52,726
Your Majesty,
I beg of you to be cautious.

120
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,957
Something is seriously wrong here.
This ship that has just landed,

121
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:56,446
I beg you,
place it under guard immediately.

122
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:58,006
Your Majesty, please?

DRACONIAN: (SHOUTING) Earthmen!

124
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:03,398

Ah, you idiots!
Back to the ship, all of you!

00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:11,403
Come on, back to the ship!

128
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,325
Now will you believe
in the treachery of the Earthmen?

129
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:18,558
Your Majesty, look down here
and tell me, what do you see?

130
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:20,239
(HYPNOTIC PULSE SOUNDING)

131
00:08:22,807 --> 00:08:25,480
I see one of your Earth soldiers

132
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:29,003
who attacked my palace
and killed my people.

133
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:31,840
Jo? Jo, can you still hear that sound?

134
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:32,962
(HYPNOTIC PULSE FADING)

135
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:35,515
Yes, it's fading. It's almost gone.

136
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:37,325
Your Majesty, I beg of you, please.
Look again.

137
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:39,602
Why do we delay? Destroy him!

138
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:41,482
Wait!

139
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:47,685
He has spoken the truth.

140
00:08:58,047 --> 00:09:00,197
Great, lumbering idiots!

141
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:04,121
Now you tell me that you've left
one of your fellows in the palace!

142
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:05,879
Do you realise what this means?

143
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:08,481
As soon as the effect
of the hypno-sound wears off,

144
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:11,479
the Draconians will know
who it really was who attacked them.

145
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:12,716
You've ruined everything!

146
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:14,286
What shall we do now?

147
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:17,962
Do? There's only one thing we can do.

148
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:20,242
Make sure that the Doctor
and his evidence

149
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,636
is never allowed to reach Earth.

150
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:30,477
Why does the Master want war
between Earth and Draconia?

151
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:33,843
Did you attack our spaceships
and those of the Earthmen?

152
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:36,316
Oh, it's no good.
We're not getting anywhere.

153
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:38,796
Let me take him for questioning.
He will answer to me.

154
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:40,400
I shall use the mind probe.

155
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:42,557
You'd only be wasting your time.

156
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:45,525
The Ogrons have got the finest
defence mechanism of all, stupidity.

157
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:46,756
They haven't got a mind
for you to probe.

158
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:50,203
Then remove him.
We will deal with him later.

159
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:58,042
Why did that sound make us see
this creature as a soldier from Earth?

160
00:09:58,127 --> 00:09:59,958
Because you're frightened of Earthmen.

161
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:02,242
Draconians fear nothing, female.

162
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:06,479
Well, of course you do.
You fear them and they fear you.

163
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:09,718
That's why when Earthmen
heard that sound, they saw Draconians.

164
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:11,081
That is true.

165
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:16,287
We do fear the Earthmen
and they fear us.

166
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,801
And fear breeds hatred, Your Majesty.

167
00:10:18,887 --> 00:10:22,197
Fear is the greatest enemy of them all,
for fear leads us to war.

168
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:25,438
We shall tell the Earthmen
what has happened here.

169
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:27,358
They, too, must know the truth.

170
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:29,085
They will not believe us.

171
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:30,805
The Prince is right, Your Majesty.

172
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:33,959
We must mount an expedition at once
and we must take the Ogron as evidence.

173
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,197
The empires are on the verge of war.

174
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,198
A Draconian spaceship in Earth space

175
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:41,723
could be destroyed before it
reaches its destination.

176
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,763
We could use the ship
the Master brought us in.

177
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,166
It's an Earth police spaceship.

178
00:10:45,247 --> 00:10:47,283
Females are not permitted to speak...

179
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:48,766
The female may speak.

180
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,077
-But...
-We must respect

181
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:54,796
the customs of our guests,
strange though they may be.

182
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,798
The suggestion had merit.

183
00:10:56,887 --> 00:10:58,684
Thank you, Your Majesty.

184
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:00,837
You too, will go on this mission.

185
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,646
But it must be headed
by a Draconian of noble rank.

186
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:05,877
I shall send my son.

187
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,515
Here you are. Brought you some food.

188
00:11:23,607 --> 00:11:25,518
And a delicious banana.

189
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:31,318
I think you're supposed
to peel it first.

190
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,125
Oh, well.

191
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:38,120
Hey, you know,
you wanna be very careful of him.

192
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:40,482
He's not as stupid as he looks.

193
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:46,002
(SIGHING) I know, I know,
women aren't allowed to speak.

194
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:51,445
You know, I think it's about time that
women's lib was brought to Draconia.

195
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:03,518
Hello, Jo. How's your Ogron friend?

196
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:07,361
Not too happy.
He seemed to enjoy his banana, though.

197
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:09,119
Doctor, where are we?

198
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:11,596
We're just about to cross
the frontier into Earth space.

199
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,166
Ooh, that's good.

200
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:15,761
Unless your Earth people destroy us.

201
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:18,077
Well, this is an Earth police spaceship,
you know, sir.

202
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,078
Even if it is stolen.

203
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,397
What is that?

204
00:12:22,487 --> 00:12:24,637
DOCTOR: It looks like another spaceship.

205
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,957
It appears to be following us.

206
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:34,360
OGRON: Look!

207
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,964
MASTER: Well, that must be them.

208
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:40,515
No other ship would be on a course
for Earth at a time like this.

209
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:42,279
We are on a course for Earth!

210
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,835
Well, naturally,
because we're chasing them...

211
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,962
(SIGHING IN EXASPERATION)

212
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:48,197
Keep quiet and let me think!

213
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:51,321
Now, soon they'll be
within striking distance.

214
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:53,841
What will you do, Master?

215
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:57,158
I'd like to try and take
the Doctor alive, if possible.

216
00:12:57,247 --> 00:13:02,002
If not, I'll blast him out of space.
Pity, though.

217
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:03,725
You do not wish to kill him?

218
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:05,638
Of course, I do!

219
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:10,596
But I don't know,
rocket fire at long range, it's...

220
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:13,963
I don't know,
somehow it lacks that personal touch.

221
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,118
They're closing in.

222
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:19,880
Perhaps, it's a frontier patrol ship
coming to investigate us.

223
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,276
Well, can't we talk to them
and tell them who we are?

224
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:25,279
We can try.
We should be within audio range.

225
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:30,198

police spaceship 2390,

232
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,837
your ship is one that
has been reported as stolen.

233
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:53,919
You will please reduce speed,
so that we can board you.

234
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:56,957
Hello, Earth police spaceship 142.

235
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:58,719
(SOFTLY) I think there'll
in trouble over this.

236
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:02,720
Hello, we've recaptured this ship
and are taking it back to Earth. Over.

MASTER ON RADIO: <i>Reduce speed</i>
<i>immediately, so that we can board you.</i>

238
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:09,963
Why should we submit to this delay?
Our mission has diplomatic immunity.

239
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:12,402
Yes, but they unfortunately
didn't know that, did they?

240
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:13,886
Hello, Earth police spaceship,

241
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:16,117
we are reducing speed as you request.
Over.

242
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:18,675
Doctor, are you sure?
We don't really know if it's the police.

243
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:22,396
Yes, exactly. That's why I want
to get them into visual scanner range.

244
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:26,526
Right, they've reduced speed.

245
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:29,679
They should be within
striking distance now.

246
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:32,600
That's about it.
Release the first missile!

247
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:47,726

on the visual scanner now.

249

Can we not fire back?

257
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:29,081
No. No, I'm afraid we're outgunned.

258
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,761
This isn't a battle cruiser, you know.

259

-The prisoner?
-Don't worry about him.

329
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:21,004
My dear, Miss Grant, in the climate
of opinion that I have created,

330
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:22,566
do you think that any Earthman

331
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:24,683
is going to believe the word
of a Draconian?

332
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:29,443
Your Highness,
we've heard the Doctor's theory before.

333
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:33,236
And, with respect,
there is still no concrete evidence.

334
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:35,636
I myself would like to believe you
but, as you can see,

335
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:37,797
I need proof to convince my people.

336
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:40,117
Then we must mount an expedition
to the planet of the Ogrons.

The proof we need is there, madam.

338
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,563

how can we divert our forces

I'm not asking for a battle fleet.

342
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:54,157
All I require is one small spaceship.

343
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:55,680
Your request is granted.

344
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:57,246
On the contrary, your request is denied.

345
00:19:57,327 --> 00:19:58,362
My authority...

346
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,119
WILLIAMS: In a purely military
matter of this kind, madam,

347
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:01,560
your authority is limited.

348
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:03,524
I can overrule you.

349
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:05,643
Only with the backing
of the full Earth senate.

350
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:08,195
And do you think they will give it?

351
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:11,958
How can we expect help
from a man such as this?

352
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:15,084
This is the man who deliberately
caused war between our people!

353
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:16,361
That is untrue!

354
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:19,883
Twenty years ago,
you destroyed a Draconian ship

355
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:21,685
that had come in a mission of peace.

356
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:25,123
A ship that was about to open fire on us
when we were damaged and helpless.

357
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:28,358
They came in peace,
as had been arranged.

358
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:30,915
Then why didn't they answer my signals?

359
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:34,886
Their communications equipment
had been destroyed in a neutron storm.

360
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,277
The same neutron storm
that damaged your ship!

361
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:39,800
Is this true?

362
00:20:39,887 --> 00:20:42,526
I have read the records
of my father's court.

363
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:44,199
It is the truth.

364
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:46,564
But why a battle cruiser?

365
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,717
The agreement was that both ships
were to be unarmed.

366
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:50,877
Naturally, we sent a cruiser.

367
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:53,720
How else should a nobleman
of Draconia travel?

368
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:59,086
But its missile banks were empty,
the ship was unarmed.

369
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,236
Well, very soon we shall be landing.

370
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:09,115
I think, Miss Grant, you had better
prepare yourself for a long stay.

371
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:11,323
I'm afraid it's not
a very comfortable place,

372
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:13,079
but as the old song says,

373
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:16,318
"Be it ever so humble,
there's no place like home."

374
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:18,479
Your Highness,

375
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:22,719
please accept my deepest regrets
for the wrong I have done your people.

376
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:26,516
Then, can I take it, sir, that you will
now authorise the expedition?

377
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:28,563
I intend to lead it.

378
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:32,003
If the planet of the Ogrons exists,
we shall find it.

379
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:40,684
Be careful down here.

380
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:45,521
This way.

381
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:53,879
Right, in there.

382
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:17,115
Well, Miss Grant,
welcome to my humble abode.

383
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:18,720
I think you were better off in prison.

384
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:19,956
Oh, temporary quarters, my dear.

385
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,436
I shall soon be changing them
for something better.

386
00:22:22,527 --> 00:22:24,324
Oh, you'll soon be back in jail.

387
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:25,442
When the truth gets out,

388
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:28,280
Earth and Draconia will combine
their forces to attack you.

389
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:31,803
I don't think so.
There's too much distrust between them.

390
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:33,445
The Doctor will find you, eventually.

391
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:37,042
Ah, there I agree with you.
He must find me.

392
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:39,766
Not only to rescue you,

393
00:22:39,847 --> 00:22:43,965
but also to be reunited
with his beloved TARDIS.

394
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:50,646
You know, Miss Grant,
I'm going to set a trap for the Doctor.

395
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:53,803
And you are going to help me.

396
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:55,036
What?

397
00:22:55,727 --> 00:23:00,164
No noble speeches to the effect that
you'd rather die than betray the Doctor?

398
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:02,715
You know I'm not going to help you.

399
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,117
I know that you are.

400
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:12,801
I know that you will obey me.

401
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:19,358
You will obey me! I am the Master...

402
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:21,677
"Mary had a little lamb,
his fleece was white as snow,

403
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:22,882
"and everywhere that Mary went,

404
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,161
-"the lamb was sure to go."
-You will obey me...

405
00:23:24,247 --> 00:23:26,522
"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall..."

406
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:27,960
Stop that, Miss Grant!

407
00:23:28,047 --> 00:23:29,116
It's a form of self-conditioning.

408
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:32,005
You fill your mind with nonsense
and then you can't be hypnotised.

409
00:23:32,087 --> 00:23:33,361
-"See-saw, Margery Daw...
-You will obey me.

410
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:34,641
"Johnny shall have a new master.

411
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:35,955
-"He shall have but a penny a day...
-You will...

412
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,366
-"Because he can't work any faster..."
-Obey me!

413
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:40,280
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

414
00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:43,121
I was never very fond
of nursery rhymes anyhow!

415
00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:46,358
Then you'll just have to give up
all hope of hypnotising me, won't you?

416
00:23:46,447 --> 00:23:48,802
Once was quite enough, thank you.

417
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:49,956
Hmm.

418
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:56,838
In that case,
I shall have to try something else.

419
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,081
You may have heard this
noise before, Miss Grant.

420
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:02,885
(HYPNOTIC PULSE SOUNDING)

421
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:07,677
It works directly on the fear centres
deep in your mind!
