I've been telling you the truth for some considerable time
我一直在告诉你真相, 颇有一段时间了

138
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:07,123
but you just won't believe me.
但你就是我相信我

139
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:10,165
I can't think why you chose to work for the Draconians.
我想不通你为什么选择去为龙族人卖命

140
00:07:10,287 --> 00:07:14,246
But whatever it is, I'll double any offer they've made to you.
不管怎样吧, 他们给你许诺了什么, 我都加倍

141
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:16,204
That's very generous of you, madam,
夫人, 您真是慷慨

142
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:19,563
but you'd only be buying information that doesn't exist.
但这是在买不存在的信息

143
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,404
You leave me no alternative.
你让我没有选择了

144
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:25,638
Under the powers invested in me by the Special Security Act,
根据特别安全法案授权于我的权力

145
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:29,197
I'm sending you to the Lunar Penal Colony.
我现在发配你去月球刑事殖民地

146
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:31,721
What, without a trial?
什么, 不进行审判吗?

147
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:34,640
Without even a chance to state my case?
甚至都不给我一个陈述的机会?

148
00:07:36,327 --> 00:07:41,162
So, you're just tucking me quietly away, are you?
你们就这样把我悄悄地处理了, 是吧?

149
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:43,798
What about my companion?
我的同伴会怎样?

150
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:45,445
She will remain here.
她将留在这里

151
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:47,677
I have hopes that, away from your influence,
我还是有所期待, 远离了你的影响

152
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,235
I might be able to make her see the error of her ways.
我也许能让她看明白她走错了路

153
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:52,841
But you will see that she comes to no harm?
但你可否盯着点, 让她免受伤害?

154
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:55,043
We are not barbarians.

If you want to help her,

why don't you tell me where she comes from?

I'd like to inform her family.

I'd like to, madam.
我也期望如此, 夫人

159
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:07,436
I really would, but there's nothing that I can say
that you'd believe.
我真的这样, 但确实我说不出什么你能相信的东西

160
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,361
May I say goodbye to her?

No! You'll be leaving immediately for the penal colony.
不, 你要立刻出发去刑事殖民地

162
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:17,600
We're putting you where
your Draconian friends will be unable to reach you.
我们要把你放到你那些龙族朋友够不到你的地方

163
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:37,600
Over there.

What did they get you for?

Oh, it's a long story.
哦, 说来话长

You are a political, aren't you?

00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,365
But there's got to be a first time for everything, hasn't there?
但任何事总有个第一次, 对吧

269
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:51,235
Come on, Professor, come and tell me all you know about the layout here.
来吧, 教授, 来跟我说说这里的布局

270
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:56,080
Truly, Madam President, I...
真的, 总统夫人, 我...

271
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,885
I sympathise with your position.
我同情您的处境

272
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:01,198
But my government has sought these criminals throughout the galaxy.
但我的政府在搜索这些罪犯, 把整个星系搜了个遍

273
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:03,801
They are now prisoners of the government of Earth.
他们现在是地球政府的囚犯

274
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:04,922
That's good enough.
这就足够了

275
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:08,204
With the greatest respect, General Williams, I must disagree.
带着极大的敬意, Williams 将军, 我必须不同意

276
00:14:08,287 --> 00:14:10,005
They are citizens of Sirius 4.
他们是天狼星4号的臣民

277
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:11,679
Part of Earth's empire.
那也是地球帝国的一部分

278
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,043
Yes, but it has been granted dominion status.
是的, 但它已经被授权可以自治

279
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:17,561
He has a point, General Williams.
他说得有点道理, Williams 将军

280
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:19,922
Once a colony has been raised to dominion status,
一旦殖民地被授予自治权

281
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:22,316
it enjoys certain autonomous rights,
它就应该享有这份权利

282
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:25,479
including the right to try and punish its own citizens.
这也包括审判和惩罚它自己臣民的权利

283
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:28,559
Exactly. But I feel sure that once these two have come to trial,
正是. 但我很肯定, 一旦这两个人被审判了之后

284
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:30,875
my government will be only too happy to send them back to you
我们政府会很乐意将他们送回来

285
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:32,481
for further interrogation.
以便你们进一步审讯

286
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:35,161
But, meanwhile, my orders are clear.
但与此同时, 我收到的命令也是很清楚的,

287
00:14:35,247 --> 00:14:37,477
I must take them back with me to Sirius 4.
我必须把他们带回天狼星4号

288
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:42,038
I will not hand over vital prisoners to some tin-pot colony!
我不会把这么重要的囚犯交给某个破烂殖民地

289
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:45,477
As the commissioner has pointed out, General Williams,
正如专员所指出的, Williams 将军,

290
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:49,276
Sirius 4 is no longer a colony. It is a dominion.
天狼星4号已经不是一个殖民地了, 它是一个主权国

291
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:51,998
Your request is granted.
你的请求被批准了

292
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:55,238
Madam President, I am most grateful.
总统夫人, 我由衷感激

293
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,285
Heaven help you if you let them escape!
如果你让他们逃跑的话, 让老天帮你吧

294
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,801
You may rest assured, General Williams,
你可以回去休息了, Williams 将军

295
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:02,923
they will be perfectly safe with me.
他们跟我在一起非常安全

296
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:08,325
Right, keep it moving!
好了, 往前走

297
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:10,798
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

298
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:13,916
Is this all we get?
我们就只能得到这个?

299
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:16,965
It contains all the elements to support life.
这东西包含了能支撑生命的所有要素

300
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:20,203
Mmm, and absolutely nothing to make it enjoyable, eh?
唔, 但完全没考虑把它做得讨喜一点, 是吧

301
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,562
You get used to it after a month or two.
你过一两个月就习惯了

302
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:24,080
Anyway, it's all we ever get.
不管怎么说, 我们只能得到这个

303
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,920
- Keep moving! - You heard him, move!
- 继续往前走!  - 你听到了, 走!

304
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:29,715
Not exactly friendly, are they?
他们一点也不友好, 是吧

305
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:31,843
One gets used to it.
早就习惯了

306
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:33,201
What time do we get to bed?
我们什么时候上床呢?

307
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:36,563
Anytime. There's no day or night here.
随时. 这里没有白天黑夜

308
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:39,957
No. Uh, tell me, Professor, when...
不, 嗷. 告诉我, 教授, 什么时候...

309
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,560
When do you plan to escape?
你打算什么时候逃跑?

310
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:43,638
No one escapes from here.
没人能从这里逃跑

311
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:45,479
But you're going to try?
但你还是要试?

312
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:48,286
For all I know, you could be a spy for the Governor.
就我所知的情况, 你可能是监狱长派来的奸细

313
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:51,040
If I were, I'd hardly be drawing attention to myself
如果我是, 我会这么着急地显露自己吗

314
00:15:51,127 --> 00:15:52,640
quite so quickly, now would I?
会吗?

315
00:15:52,727 --> 00:15:56,117
No, a valid point of logic.
不会. 有点道理

316
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:58,323
I wonder if I can trust you?
我在想, 能不能信任你

317
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:00,716
You've little or no alternative, Professor.
你的选择很少, 或者说没有, 教授

318
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:01,876
We're all in this sector together.
我们都在这个片区

319
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,195
Whatever you do, I shall know about it.
不管你做什么, 我都会知道

320
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:05,357
Yes, but we don't know you.
是的, 但我们不了解你

321
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:06,562
Why did they send you here?
他们为什么把你送进来?

322
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:09,115
Oh, I was sent here at the express wish of
a certain General Williams.
哦, 某个 Williams 将军一声令下, 我就被送到这里来了

323
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:10,276
We have no proof of that.
我们没有见到证据

324
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:12,835
We have no reason to tell you anything.
我们没有理由把什么都告诉你

325
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:14,883
I'll tell you something.
我跟你说

326
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:17,959
There is a conspiracy to start a war between Earth and Draconia.
现在有一场阴谋, 要挑起地球与龙族之间的战争

327
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:20,242
There are warmongers on both sides. We are aware of that.
两边都有一些好战分子, 这我们很清楚

328
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:23,285
But there's also a third party, Professor,
但还有一个第三方, 教授

329
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:26,803
who's plotting to set the two empires at each other's throats.
他的阴谋已经让两个帝国相互掐住了咽喉

330
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:34,356
No, I'll see her alone.
不, 我要单独见她

331
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:48,201
Penny for them, Miss Grant?
好久不见 (fixme), Grant 小姐?

332
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:51,677
You! What are you doing here?
你! 你在这里干什么?

333
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:55,420
To coin a phrase, I've come to take you away from all this.
简单地说, 我来带你远离这一切

334
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:56,643
What are you talking about?
你这是什么意思

335
00:16:56,727 --> 00:16:59,046
Well, surely you don't want to
spend the rest of your life in here, do you?
你当然不会期望在这里过完你的下半辈子, 是吧?

336
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:00,799
Well, I'm not going anywhere with you, that's for sure.
这是当然. 但我也不打算同你去任何地方

337
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,639
Oh, but you are, you know.
你会的, 知道吗

338
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:03,796
Believe it or not,
不管你信不信

339
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:07,766
I am a fully accredited commissioner from the planet Sirius 4
我现在是天狼星4号的完全授权的专员

340
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:10,122
and you and the Doctor are two dangerous criminals
而你和博士是两个危险的罪犯

341
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:12,801
being handed over into my custody.
要转交到我的手中

342
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:14,559
So it was you!
原来是你!

343
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:16,842
You ordered those Ogrons to attack the ships
是你命令了那些 Ogrons 来攻击那艘货船

344
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:18,155
and pretend they were Draconians!
还让他们假装是龙族人!

345
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,362
But, of course!
不过, 当然了

346
00:17:19,447 --> 00:17:21,165
Those lumbering idiots could never have thought up
那些愚蠢的家伙是无论如何也想不出

347
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:23,522
such a brilliant scheme by themselves.
如此天才的计划的

348
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:26,679
Why did you want to start a war?
你为什么要挑起一场战争?

349
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:29,367
Now, come on, Miss Grant, be reasonable.
得了, Grant 小姐, 理性一点

350
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,278
You want to see the Doctor again, don't you?
你还想再见到博士的, 对吧?

351
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:33,835
- Where is he? - He's in another prison, on the Moon.
- 他在哪儿?  - 他现在在另外一个监狱, 月球上

352
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,918
We're going to collect him.
我们要去接他

353
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:37,838
How do I know you're telling the truth?
我怎么知道你说的是不是实话?

354
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:39,076
You don't.
你不知道

355
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,965
And the only way you'll find out is by coming with me.
唯一搞明白的方法就是跟我走

356
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:43,162
Well?
怎样

357
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:44,475
(SIGHING)

358
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,727
How did you know we were here in the first place?
你怎么知道我们在这里的?

359
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:51,479
Well, after they'd attacked the cargo ships,
啊, 当那些 Ogrons 攻击了那艘货船之后

360
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:56,083
the Ogrons returned to their planet, taking their loot with them.
他们带着战利品, 回到自己的星球

361
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:59,159
Now imagine my surprise, and my delight,
想想一下我的惊讶, 还有喜悦

362

when I found that they brought me the Doctor's TARDIS.

363
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:03,959
And why are you taking us with you?

364
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:05,400
Oh, need you ask?
哦, 这还需要说?

365
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:08,524
How could I leave two dear friends in such dire straits?

366
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:10,040
Oh, you don't seriously think that
哦, 你才不是这么想的

367
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:11,321
I'm going to believe that you want to help us...

368
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:13,523
Believe what you like, Miss Grant, I have my reasons.
不管你信不信, Grant 小姐, 我有我的理由

369
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:15,006
Now, are you coming,
现在, 你是跟着走呢?

370
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:18,762
or do you really wish to vegetate in
this hole for the rest of your natural?
还是打算真在这个洞里耗完下半辈子?

00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:22,357
Very well. I'll come.
好吧, 我去

372
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:23,846
Excellent!

The prisoner and I are ready to leave now, guard.

Anywhere is better than here.

375
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:39,202
DOCTOR: Well, there you are. There you have it.
诺, 就是这样, 你听到啦

376
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:40,925
That's how I came to be here.
这就是我怎么来到这里的

377
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:42,679
It's fantastic!
太神奇了!

378
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:44,678
I mean, our people seeing Draconians,
你看, 我们的人看见的是龙族人

379
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:48,646
Draconians seeing Earthmen. I can't believe it.
龙族人看见的是地球人, 我简直不敢相信

380
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,797
Well, I can.
不过呢, 我信

381
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:52,320
Good grief.
感谢老天

382
00:18:53,087 --> 00:18:55,237
Do you know, sir, you're the first person who's believed me?
你知道吗, 先生, 你是第一个相信我的

383
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:57,283
It would explain a great deal.
这样很多事情就说得通了

384
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:00,242
After the stupidity of he Draconian war,
那场愚蠢的龙族战争结束之后

385
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:05,276
the bitterness eventually died down and we had many years of peace.
苦痛渐渐退去, 我们有了多年的和平

386
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,561
There were trade treaties, cultural exchanges

387
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,561
and then, for no reason at all, these sudden acts of hostility.
然后, 没有任何缘由, 突然出现了这些敌对行为

388
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,916
(DOOR OPENING)

389
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:16,157
Dale! Over here!
Dale! 过来

390
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:19,080
- Yes, what is it?  - Spot check. You ought to know.
- 好, 什么事?  - 检查, 你自己知道

391
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,126
If you'll excuse me, one of our little prison rituals.
抱歉先离开一会, 有个监狱小仪式

392
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:31,241
This is it. There's a VIP landing on this spaceship
机会来了, 马上会有一艘VIP飞船降落

393
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:32,521
in 10 minutes' time, Bay 7.
只有10分钟了, 7号站

You can pinch it. I've set up two spacesuits for you.
你得抓紧了, 我已经给你们准备好了两套宇航服

395
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:36,075
I can't believe it.

好, 我说到做到, 你也要主动哦傲

397
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,844
When you get back to Earth, don't forget who your friends are.
等你回到地球, 别忘了谁是你的朋友

- 怎样, 有什么事?  - 哦, 只是搜查一下

Come on, Professor. Come on!

You were giving off conspiracy in waves over there.

You can trust me, you know.

啊, 那你真是太慷慨了, 不过...

你不知道, 终于找到盟友对我来说意味着什么

Well, we'd better be going, Doctor.

Take this one?

We can't use the main entrance to the spaceport.

431
00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:38,122
It's too well guarded.

All we have to do is to walk across the Moon's surface,
我们要做的, 就是从月球表面穿过去

Tell me, Professor, why is Cross helping you?

A kind of bribery, I'm afraid.
这算是一种行贿, 恐怕是

I promised to get him a free pardon once we get into power.
我承诺他说, 一旦我们掌权了, 会给他一个赦免

That's extraordinary.
I would have thought he would have wanted something
这很特别啊. 我原以为他想要的东西很难给呢

438
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:58,405
far more positive than promises.
没想到一个承诺就搞定了

DALE: Oh, he's not a bad fellow when you get to know him.
哦, 他倒不是个坏人, 如果你了解他的话

00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:02,244
I appealed to his better self.

clip my cylinder on the back of my suit
and then I'll fix up yours.
在我后背挂一下氧气瓶, 然后我来挂你的

There, look at the gauge.

Yes, and so is this one.

They're both empty, Professor.

00:22:57,327 --> 00:22:59,602
The door, it's locked!

你不明白吗, 朋友, 他们正在往外排空气!
