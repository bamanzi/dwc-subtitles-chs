00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:35,687
But all these charges are false, Your Highness.

6
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:39,163
We are not attacking Draconian ships. We never have!

7
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,284
Our soldiers have seen the Earthmen attack us.

8
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,756
Our cargos have been stolen.

9
00:00:44,847 --> 00:00:49,045
We are Draconians, we do not lie.

10
00:00:49,127 --> 00:00:51,766
The honour of your race is well known, Your Highness.

11
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,838
That is why I cannot understand your actions.

12
00:00:53,927 --> 00:00:55,076
Actions?

13
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:58,557
You attack our ships, you steal their cargoes,

14
00:00:58,647 --> 00:01:02,162
you ignore our protests and just meet them with these counter-charges.

15
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:06,763
Our charges are true but yours are false.

16
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:09,315
We do not attack your ships.

17
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:18,516
Well, I'm never going in that thing again.

18
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:20,757
Oh, come on, Jo, be reasonable.

19
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,998
Only you could manage to have a traffic accident in space.

20
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:26,885
- Well, we didn't hit it, did we? - Didn't we? Where's this then?

21
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:28,878
Well, by a rather brilliant last-minute course correction,

22
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:31,925
I've managed to materialise the TARDIS inside the spaceship.

23
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:33,281
But to avoid hitting it,

24
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:35,562
I've had to make a random jump back into normal space.

25
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:37,717
Terrific, but what do we do now?

26
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:40,446
Well, if I'm to get us back to Earth, I'd better find out where we are.

27
00:01:40,527 --> 00:01:42,199
I'll just go and check the instruments.

28
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:45,077
HARDY: You won't believe this.

29
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:47,601
- Now what? - Maybe it's a wreck.

30
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:49,965
Try and make contact. They may need help.

31
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:53,562
This is Earth cargo ship C982 in close proximity to you.

32
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,319

Are you in need of assistance?

37
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,119

40
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:27,063
- Doctor? - Well, I think I know where we are.

41
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,978
I've got a pretty good idea about when.

42
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,262
- Come and take a look at this. - A look at what?

43
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:32,860
That.

44
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:34,938
Well, it's just a spaceship, Jo.

45
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:38,940
Now, I reckon we must be somewhere in the 26th century.

46
00:02:39,027 --> 00:02:41,939
Well, interstellar travel's pretty routine by now.

47
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:44,825
A moment ago, it seemed to change shape.

48
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:47,944
- Hmm? - It was when I heard that noise.

49
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:49,665
Didn't you hear it?

50
00:02:49,747 --> 00:02:52,136
Well, I did hear something but very faintly.

51
00:02:52,227 --> 00:02:53,501
Come on, Jo. Let's go and find the crew.

52
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:55,855
I want to find the exact date for my calculations.

53
00:02:55,987 --> 00:02:58,342
- HARDY: They're going to attack us! - STEWART: Get the blasters.

54

55
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,500
Get the blasters!

67
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:48,343

I found these two Dragons in the hold.

84
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:41,984
But that's impossible. They... They're only just locking on.

85
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:44,023
Doctor, what's happening? What's going on?

86
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:46,177
I'm not sure, Jo. Something rather intriguing.

87
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:52,385
<i>If you resist, we can destroy you with our neutronic weapons.</i>

88
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:55,256
If you destroy our ship, you won't get the cargo.

89
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:57,298
Oh, so that's what it's all about.

- We refuse. - They can blow us to pieces!

93
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:08,902
I've sent a message to Earth asking for help.

94
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:12,820
This is a transcript of a distress call from one of our ships.

95

"From Earth's cargo ship number C982 on coordinate 8972/6483.

"galaxy class, equipped with neutronic missiles."

98
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:30,906
The treaty between our two empires established a frontier in space.

99
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:33,785
We have never violated that frontier.

100
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:37,896
You have invaded our part of the galaxy many times.

101
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:40,579
In pursuit of your ships when they have raided ours!

102
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,657
We've been very patient, perhaps too patient.

103
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,385
General Williams!

104
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,378
I take it a rescue attempt has been mounted?

105
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:50,503
We've established an automatic procedure,

106
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:52,976
because of the frequency of these attacks.

107
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:55,740
Then I suggest you go and supervise the matter.

108
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:57,146
There's no need.

109
00:05:57,787 --> 00:06:00,142
Please do as I say.

110
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:05,296
As you wish, Madam President.

111
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:16,737
Your general is insolent.

112
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:20,615
We know the hatred he has always felt for our people.

113
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:23,016
Long ago he caused war.

114
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:25,575
Now he wishes to do so again.

115
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:28,864
He's a soldier, Your Highness, and he's angry.

116
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:32,306
The people of Earth are angry.

117
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:36,016
So are the nobles of my father's court!

118
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:39,981
I must ask you to take my personal appeal to your father, the Emperor.

119
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,537
He must put a stop to these attacks.

120
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:46,425
If Draconia has some grievances against Earth,

121
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:49,305
then this is not the way to deal with them.

122
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:55,543
Many of our noblemen felt it was a mistake
to make a treaty with the Earthmen.

123
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:58,701
Perhaps they were right.

124
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:02,063
You attack our ships and when we protest

125
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:05,219
you trick us with lies and evasions.

126
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:08,346
I give you a final warning.

127
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,817
The path you are treading leads only to war.

128
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:16,776
And in that war, Draconia will destroy you!

Doctor, what are you doing?

132
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:33,560
I'm reversing the polarity of my ultrasonic screwdriver's power source,

133
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:36,605
thereby converting it into an extremely powerful electromagnet.

134
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,484
Oh. What good will that do?

135
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:41,035
You wait and see, Jo.

136
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:44,676
Is it working?

138
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:46,922
Yes, I think so.

139
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:49,318
- I'm going to get the prisoners. - What for?

140
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:51,238
We're using them as hostages, remember?

141
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:54,160
You'd better be quick about it. We haven't got much time.

142
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:58,525
- How is it going? - Nearly there.

00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:04,202

145
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:09,363
Oh, how very embarrassing.  Good afternoon.

146
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:13,241
- Out. - That's just where we were going.

147
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,716
We're going to meet your friends.

148
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:20,082
- Come on! Get up there! - Come on, they're almost through.

149
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,806
HARDY: Get in front! If your friends start shooting,
they'll get you first.

150
00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:25,640
- But they're not our friends! - You are part of their boarding party.

151
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:27,877
They haven't boarded yet. They're still breaking through that door.

152
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:30,435
- Now, try and be logical, man. - They're coming through!

153
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:35,241
- Ogrons! - DOCTOR: Back to the TARDIS, Jo. Back!

154
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:41,717
Doctor! Doctor!

155
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:54,485
JO: (SOFTLY) Doctor?

156
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,761
- Jo? - JO: Doctor!

157
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:06,520
- Jo? - JO: Doctor, I'm over here.

158
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,603
All right, Jo, what are you doing in there?

159
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:20,643
Oh, Doctor, thank goodness, you're all right.

160
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,686
I thought they'd killed you.

161
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,564
Come on, come and sit down.

162
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:33,005
Must have been some kind of neuronic stun gun.

163
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:37,715
I wonder why they didn't kill me? What exactly happened, Jo?

164
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:40,924
Well, they took the cargo, threw me in here and...

165
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:42,520
- Doctor? - Hmm?

166
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:46,236
- They also took the TARDIS. - Oh...

167
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:50,320
Oh, we're stranded. What are we going to do?

168
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:51,999
Well, try and get the TARDIS back, of course.

170
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:55,522
Why should the Ogrons attack this ship?

171
00:09:55,607 --> 00:10:00,078
- To steal the cargo. - No. No, there's more to it than that.

172

it's all too sophisticated for the Ogrons.

174
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,684
- Well, they're gone now. - Yeah, the question is, where?

175
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:14,801
Hey, Doctor, last time we met the Ogrons

176
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:16,878
they were working for the Daleks, right?

177
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:20,039
- Well, you don't suppose that that... - No, no, not necessarily.

178
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:22,595
No, the Ogrons are mercenaries.

179
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:25,520
Other life forms use them to do their dirty work.

180
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:29,320
Come on, Jo, let's go and find the crew.

181
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:33,801
<i>(博士与 Jo 上一次碰到 Ogrons 是在09x01 The Day of the Daleks 这集,

182
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:44,598
Take a look at that one.

183
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,157
DOCTOR: It's all right, Jo. We're being rescued.

184
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,566
- What happened? - Well, don't worry, old chap.

185
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,008
You'll be all right now. I think...

186
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:02,062
Draconians! They're boarding!

187
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:06,476
- Stewart? Who are you? - Passengers.

188
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:11,098
I see. Having a fancy dress party? What happened?

189
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:13,621
- Dragons attacked us. - Did they get the cargo?

190
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,425
- I don't know. - Yes, they took everything.

191
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,782
Including some rather valuable property of mine.

192
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:21,064
- Well, tough luck. - Oh, thank you very much.

193
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,742
- Dragons... They attacked us. - Yes, we know.

194
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:27,546
You say you're passengers.
Isn't that a little unusual on a cargo ship?

195
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:29,060
Well, we're here, aren't we?

196
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,739
Where did you pick these two up?

197
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,385
I don't know. I can't seem to remember...

198
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:34,856
Pull yourself together! How did they get on board?

199
00:11:35,507 --> 00:11:38,704
Stowaways... That's it, they were stowaways.

200
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:40,796
- They were sending messages. - That's right.

201
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,398
But that's absolute nonsense.

202
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:47,876
Look, we didn't want to be on this ship. It was an accident.

203
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,639
You said you were passengers.

204
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:53,561
I was merely trying to avoid a lot of tiresome explanations, old chap.

205
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:56,207
Stewart, I'll leave Kemp on board to take your ship back to Earth.

206
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,322
What about these two?

207
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:58,681
Lock them in the hold, put a guard on them.

208
00:11:58,807 --> 00:12:01,321
- But we haven't done anything. - They say you have. Take them away.

209
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,442
Now, if you'll only listen to me...

210
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:03,562
You can talk to Earth Security.

211
00:12:03,647 --> 00:12:04,716
They'll listen, it's their business.

212
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,436
- Put them in the starboard cubicle. - All right, get moving.

213
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:13,999
In there.

214
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,956
Oops. No need to push.

215
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:26,885
Doctor, well, now the Ogrons have gone,

216
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:29,527
why don't the crewmen remember what really happened?

217
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:32,326
Because the true facts have been erased from their minds, that's why.

218
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:34,602
Well, yes, but why did they keep telling lies about us?

219
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,518
Oh, they don't know that they're lying, Jo.

220
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:39,167
They're desperately trying to fit us into their version of things.

221
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:41,477
Well, what are we going to do then?

222
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:43,080
Well, when we get back to Earth,

223
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:46,364
we've got to reach someone in authority
whose mind isn't already closed.

224
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:47,675
Closed to what?

225
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,200
Jo, look, these people believe

226
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:51,278
that the Draconians are attacking their spaceships, right?

227
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,039
- Right. - We know that they're wrong, don't we?

228
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:54,446
Well, yes, it was Ogrons.

229
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:56,279
Oh, we also know that the Ogrons couldn't possibly

230
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:58,198
have created that hallucinatory device

231
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:00,801
that makes the Earthmen think they're Draconians.

232
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:03,526
Oh. Oh, well, that's simple then.

233
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:07,202
I mean, what we've got to is find out what's going on,

234
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,597
who's behind the Ogrons, where they've taken the TARDIS,

235
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:13,247
go and get it back and then we can all go home.

236
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:14,840
- Right? - Right.

237
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:18,124
Oh. I don't know what I've been worrying about.

238
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:21,477
<i>We are now in space port 10.</i>

239
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,958
<i>The ship will land in 15 minutes. The crew are safe.</i>

240
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:29,801
<i>Also aboard, two human stowaways, origins unknown.</i>

241
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:32,560
I want a cordon around the landing area,
the minute that ship touches down.

242
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:34,365
Nobody on, nobody off till I get there.

243
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,482
<i>Sir.</i>

244
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:38,859
I'd better get down there.
I want handle the preliminary interrogations myself.

245
00:13:40,507 --> 00:13:43,146
- Outside. - We want to see somebody in authority.

246
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:45,457
You're going to, but outside.

247
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:51,338
Now then, what's all this about?

248
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:55,318
- Draconian agents? Are you sure? - What else can they be?

249
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:56,840
Their story is obvious nonsense.

250
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:58,679
But why? We...

251
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:00,678
Why would the Draconians leave them on board the ship?

252
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:03,122
The Draconians are preparing for war.

253
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:05,596
You're still only suspecting that. There is no proof.

254
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:07,439
Then they need to plant human agents,

255
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:10,405
traitors, on this planet to sabotage our war effort.

256
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:13,081
But we are bound to suspect them. They must have realised.

257
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:16,045
The Draconians probably thought the crew was dead.

258
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:18,038
We could easily have accepted those two as passengers,

259
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:21,278
two unfortunate refugees from a Draconian attack,

260
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,865
- When did you last eat? - Quite some while ago.

261
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:31,744
Well, I'll see they send you some food.

262
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:34,216
I'd like to get a message through to your president.

263
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,820
Not a chance.

264
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:37,022
I'm going straight back to my ship.

265
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:38,335
Don't want to get mixed up with security.

266
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:40,145
It's not healthy.

267
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:44,426
- Look, I'll give you a piece of advice. - DOCTOR: Yes?

268
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:47,977
Sooner or later, you're going to tell them everything.

269
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,818
They'll use the mind probe. You talk to them now.

270
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:55,500
You'll save yourselves a lot of trouble.

271
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:02,779
PRESIDENT: And you are quite sure it was a Draconian battle cruiser.

272
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:03,902
Of course, Madam.

273
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,500
They locked on and boarded us.

274
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:08,101
We saw them. They were Draconians.

275
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:11,064
Thank you. That will be all.

276
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:14,139
I hope you will soon recover from your ordeal.

277
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:21,186
Well, Your Highness?

278
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,303
These men are your servants.

279
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:26,220
They are saying what they have been ordered to say.

280
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:29,538
On this occasion, we have more than our servants to confront you with.

281
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:31,265
We have captured two of your human agents.

282
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,303
We have no human agents.

283
00:15:33,427 --> 00:15:36,419
Subversion and espionage are expressly forbidden

284
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:38,941
by the treaty of peace between our two empires.

285
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:41,336
A treaty which you have flagrantly broken.

286
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:43,224
I shall return to my embassy.

287
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:46,663
Just a moment please, Your Highness. Bring them in.

288
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:54,306
These people stowed away on the cargo ship.

289
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,581
They transmitted signals

290
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:58,340
which enabled your battle cruiser to home in on its prey.

291
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:00,258
I know nothing of this.

292
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:04,545
Perhaps you do not, but some servant of the Draconian empire employed them.

293
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:08,742
Madam, I can assure that I've never been employed by anybody.

294
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,778
Least of all by the Draconians.

295
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:14,780
Your servants should have been better rehearsed in their lies.

296
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:18,064
Or they're showing a misguided loyalty to their Draconian masters.

297
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:19,944
If we really were working for the Draconians,

298
00:16:20,027 --> 00:16:21,301
why did they leave us in your ship?

299
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:24,618
To act as spies when you were brought back to Earth.

300
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:26,937
Allow me to congratulate you, sir.

301
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,939
You have the most totally closed mind that I've ever encountered.

302
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:32,143
Madam, I beg of you to listen to me.

303
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:35,742
Some third party is trying to provoke war between Earth and Draconia.

304
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:36,942
You are both being duped.

305
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:38,142
Take them away.

306
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:39,455
Just a minute, please.

307
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:40,821
Why should a third party wish to do this?

308
00:16:40,907 --> 00:16:41,976
I've no idea, Madam,

309
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,386
but believe me, that is what is happening.

310
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:44,582
Take them away.

311
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,259
Now please listen to me! If you don't

312
00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:50,977
you'll be involved in a war that could cause the death of millions.

313
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:56,856
Is this the evidence upon which you accuse me?

314
00:16:57,507 --> 00:17:00,624
I must ask you to convey a formal protest to your Emperor.

315
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:05,986
I shall inform him of this latest insult
to the honour of the Draconian empire.

316
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:18,155
But why?

317
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:22,157
Why should they produce such an elaborate lie?

318
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:28,000
The ways of the Earthmen are devious. They're an inscrutable species.

319
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:33,036
Obviously, they are preparing the next stage of their plan.

320
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:38,197
First, the attacks on our ships and now this.

321
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:43,563
Is it possible, Your Highness,
that for once the Earthmen spoke the truth?

322
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:47,925
Some plan of the Emperor of which Your Highness has not been informed?

323
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:51,443
The Emperor would not possibly contemplate such a plan.

324
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:54,087
We do not break the treaty of peace.

325
00:17:57,287 --> 00:18:01,678
Shall I prepare your Excellency's report
to the Emperor on this meeting?

326
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,596
I must have more information.

327
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:11,404
It would be useful to question the humans who were found on the ship.

328
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:16,236
They are supposed to be prisoners.

329
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:21,075
Prisoners have been known to escape, Your Highness.

330
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,205
Not without help.

331
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,759
And that would be a grave act of hostility.

332
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:30,205
I could not possibly countenance such a plan.

333
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:39,922
But, should two escaping prisoners seek sanctuary in this embassy,

334
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:44,759
it would be uncivilised to turn them away.

335
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:52,155
I must not detain you longer.

336
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:57,437
No doubt you have duties demanding your attention?

337
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:14,540
WILLIAMS: Well, Doctor, shall we try again?

338
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,582
You can suit yourself.

339
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,500
But I warn you, you're wasting your time.

340
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:22,863
(MIND PROBE BEEPING)

341
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:25,262
Are you a member of the Draconian Secret Service?

DOCTOR: I didn't.

Your machine can't be working properly. Or else he's controlling it.

00:19:51,507 --> 00:19:54,146
We've checked all the circuits, sir. Those are his thoughts.

355
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:57,060
We know this man is a Draconian agent. He must be lying.

356
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:59,456
Perhaps he's already been brainwashed, sir.

357
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:02,505
But as far as he's concerned, what he's telling us is the truth.

I've been telling you the truth for some considerable time

but you just won't believe me.

406

I can't think why you chose to work for the Draconians.

But whatever it is, I'll double any offer they've made to you.

408
00:22:34,827 --> 00:22:36,704
That's very generous of you, madam,

409
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:40,063
but you'd only be buying information that doesn't exist.

00:22:49,787 --> 00:22:52,221
What, without a trial?

414
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:55,140
Without even a chance to state my case?

415
00:22:56,827 --> 00:23:01,662
So, you're just tucking me quietly away, are you?

416
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:04,298
What about my companion?

00:23:04,387 --> 00:23:05,945

why don't you tell me where she comes from?

I'd like to inform her family.

425

I'd like to, madam.

426
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:27,936

No! You'll be leaving immediately for the penal colony.

But, of course!

446
00:24:39,747 --> 00:24:42,022
such a brilliant scheme by themselves.

447
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:45,179
Why did you want to start a war?

448
00:24:45,307 --> 00:24:47,867
Now, come on, Miss Grant, be reasonable.

449
00:24:47,947 --> 00:24:49,778
You want to see the Doctor again, don't you?

450
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:52,335
- Where is he? - He's in another prison, on the Moon.

451
00:24:52,427 --> 00:24:54,418
We're going to collect him.

452
00:24:54,507 --> 00:24:56,338
How do I know you're telling the truth?

Well, after they'd attacked the cargo ships,

459
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:14,583
the Ogrons returned to their planet, taking their loot with them.

462
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,459
And why are you taking us with you?

463
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:23,900
Oh, need you ask?

464
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:27,024
How could I leave two dear friends in such dire straits?

465
00:25:27,107 --> 00:25:28,540
Oh, you don't seriously think that

466
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:29,821
I'm going to believe that you want to help us...

467
00:25:29,907 --> 00:25:32,023
Believe what you like, Miss Grant, I have my reasons.

468
00:25:32,107 --> 00:25:33,506
Now, are you coming,

469
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:37,262
or do you really wish to vegetate in
this hole for the rest of your natural?

470
00:25:38,627 --> 00:25:40,857
Very well. I'll come.

471
00:25:40,947 --> 00:25:42,346
Excellent!

472
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:47,818
The prisoner and I are ready to leave now, guard.

473
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:11,439
- Hello, Jo. - Doctor!

474
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,918
- How are you? All right? - Well...

475
00:26:17,007 --> 00:26:19,885
Right, they'll be plenty of time
for the exchange of social pleasantries.

476
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:21,480
Put him inside.

477
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:39,923
Thank you, gentlemen.
You can leave them to me now.

478
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:47,556
Well, Doctor,
this is an interesting reversal.

479
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,798
I remember your once visiting me
when I was in prison.

480
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:53,366
You know, I'd very much
like to know why...

481
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:54,766
Why you've been locked up?

482
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,486
No, why I'm still alive.

483
00:26:57,687 --> 00:27:02,522
Oh, come, your health is very precious
to me, for the moment.

484
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:06,085
You see, my employers
are most interested in you.

485
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:10,126
-The Ogrons?
-Miss Grant, please! I employ them.

486
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:13,085
Yes, well, whatever it is you're up to,
you needn't expect any help from me.

487
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,646
I don't need any help.

488
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:17,161
Your simple presence
will be quite enough.

489
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:21,201
Oh, by the way, I need hardly warn you
there is no point in trying to escape.

490
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:23,198

493
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:30,438
(SCOFFING) Of course.
Oh, and another thing...

494
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:34,119
There's a closed-circuit television
camera trained on you from up there,

495
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:36,767
so you will be
under continuous observation.

496
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:38,166
I think that's all.

497
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:40,761
Well, now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some rather complicated

498
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:43,236
astro-navigational calculations
to work out.

499
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:45,045
May I ask where we're going?

500
00:27:45,127 --> 00:27:48,756
Certainly. To the home of our friends,
the Ogrons.

501
00:27:49,287 --> 00:27:52,802
A barren and uninteresting planet
on the remote fringes of the galaxy.

502
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:54,525
Why are you taking us there?

503
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:57,917
That, Miss Grant,
you will discover when you arrive.

504
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,397
Right, now listen to me.
We haven't got much time

505
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:06,125
before he gets back to the flight deck.

506
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,562
Now, the first thing
we've got to do is to escape.

507
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,002
Now, they took my sonic screwdriver
from me in the prison

508
00:28:11,087 --> 00:28:13,555
but they didn't get a hold of this.

509
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:16,764
-A steel file.
-Right, let's go.

510
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:18,997
No, not yet. Let's wait
till he gets back to the flight deck,

511
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:22,397
then he'll set the controls.
Now, this is an automatic spaceship.

512
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:24,842
Once we're underway,
the computers take over, right?

513
00:28:24,927 --> 00:28:26,883
-Okay, so what's the plan?
-Now this is what we're gonna do.

514
00:28:52,427 --> 00:28:54,497
<i>So I told the High Council</i>
<i>of the Time Lords,</i>

515
00:28:54,587 --> 00:28:58,466
<i>I said they had absolutely no right</i>
<i>to put me on trial in the first place.</i>

516
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:01,345
Well, if I chose to go wandering around
the universe in my own time,

517
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:02,496
that was my business.

518
00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:04,179
What about stealing the TARDIS?

519
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:06,861
I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it.

520
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:09,177
I fully intended to return it,
I assure you.

521
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:11,178
Anyway, she wasn't exactly
the latest model, poor old thing.

522
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,144
JO: (LAUGHING) You can say that again.

523
00:29:13,227 --> 00:29:15,866
I tell you, I made a complete fool
of that prosecuting council, though.

524
00:29:15,947 --> 00:29:18,142
I ridiculed his every argument.

525
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:20,377
Yes, and I told him
that I had the complete answer

526
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,946
to every one his charges against me.

527
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,426
JO: And then what happened?

528
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:26,180
DOCTOR: Then what happened, well,
they found me guilty,

529
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:28,986
changed my appearance
and exiled me to Earth.

530
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,705
JO: And that's where you met me!

531
00:29:30,787 --> 00:29:33,460
<i>That's right. That's where I met you.</i>

532
00:29:33,547 --> 00:29:35,902
<i>And that alone</i>
<i>made the exile worthwhile, Miss Grant.</i>

533
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:37,136
JO: <i>Thank you!</i>

534
00:29:37,227 --> 00:29:38,945
<i>Not that there's anything wrong</i>
<i>with Earth.</i>

535
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,541
<i>Well, it's quite a nice, little planet</i>
<i>in its own way, but...</i>

536
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:45,302
<i>After all, I am a Time Lord,Jo,</i>
<i>and I think I've deserve my freedom.</i>

537
00:29:45,387 --> 00:29:48,459
-JO: <i>Right!</i>
-In reminiscent mood, are you, Doctor?

538
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:50,856
Poor Miss Grant,
you have my deepest sympathy.

539
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:52,300
(CHUCKLING)

540
00:30:00,947 --> 00:30:03,222
As I soon realised,
the trouble with Lethbridge-Stewart

541
00:30:03,307 --> 00:30:04,706
is that he's got a military mind.

542
00:30:04,787 --> 00:30:07,824
Well, he is a brigadier, after all.
I mean, what do you expect?

543
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:08,976
No, that's just the trouble though.

544
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:12,423
He's hidebound, you see.
He always does everything by the rules.

545
00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:14,179
I keep telling him.
I said, "There are times, you know,

546
00:30:14,267 --> 00:30:16,701
"when you've simply got to cut
right through the red tape."

547
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:18,743
And you've managed to do that, have you?

548
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:22,058
DOCTOR: Yes, I've managed to cut
right through it.

549
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:27,946
And I'm not going to let authority
stand between me and my freedom.

550
00:30:28,347 --> 00:30:32,420
(SIGHING) Lethbridge-Stewart, I...

551
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:37,183
Hey! As far as he's concerned I've been
absent without leave all this time.

552
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:39,297
I'm always telling people ...

553
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:48,061
Is everything all right, Miss Grant?

554
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,097
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

555
00:30:51,427 --> 00:30:54,624
And how about you, Doctor?
No ill effects, I hope?

556
00:30:56,347 --> 00:30:58,383
Doctor, are you all right?

557
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:01,984
JO: <i>Please don't wake him.</i>
<i>He's...he's fast asleep.</i>

558
00:31:02,747 --> 00:31:07,867
Is he? How very relaxed of him.

559
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:10,262
you come with me, Miss Grant.

560
00:31:11,427 --> 00:31:12,746
Come on!

561
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:21,937
Right, in you go, Miss Grant.

562
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,098
Can you hear me, Doctor?

563
00:31:34,347 --> 00:31:37,862
<i>Are you on the flight deck?</i>
<i>If so, listen to this.</i>

564
00:31:38,707 --> 00:31:40,937
<i>Miss Grant is in the air lock.</i>

565
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,865
Unless you surrender yourself
to me immediately,

566
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:49,303
I shall open the outer door
and hurl her into space.

567
00:31:53,587 --> 00:31:56,420
What an ingenious fellow
you are, Doctor!

568
00:31:57,147 --> 00:31:59,183
Oh, no, you don't!

569
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:03,342
Now hold it, Doctor, hold it!

570
00:32:04,227 --> 00:32:06,661
Get that blaster over to me
or I press this button,

571
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:09,420
and that will be the end of Miss Grant!

572
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:18,179
(DOCTOR EXCLAIMING)

573
00:32:26,547 --> 00:32:27,775
Thank you, Doctor.

574
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:29,778
(THUDDING)

575
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:32,876
Well, we appear to have company.

576
00:32:39,387 --> 00:32:41,742
Would these be your Ogron friends?

577
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,226
Why, no, no.

578
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:47,659
Well, I should try and be
a bit more hospitable, old chap.

579
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:51,740
Come on, put that gun away.
They've probably got us outnumbered.

580
00:32:56,147 --> 00:32:59,378
Welcome on board my ship.
To what do I owe the honour?

581
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:02,379
Why have you violated
the Draconian frontier?

582
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:06,016
Uh, yes, I'm most apologetic about that,
but it was really beyond my control.

583
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:08,575
You see, my prisoners
were trying to escape and my...

584
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,897
-My ship was thrown off course.
-Prisoners?

585
00:33:10,987 --> 00:33:13,455
Yes, I am the commissioner
of Earth's Interplanetary Police.

586
00:33:13,547 --> 00:33:17,142
I'm taking these two people back
to planet Sirius 4 for...for trial.

587
00:33:17,227 --> 00:33:18,819
Uh, here is my warrant of authority.

588
00:33:18,907 --> 00:33:21,023
Now, don't believe this man, he's lying.

589
00:33:21,107 --> 00:33:24,224
I'm not concerned in disputes
between Earthmen.

590
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:27,461
We shall take them to Draconia.
Put them in the cage.

591
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,662
But you can't do that!

592
00:33:28,747 --> 00:33:30,146
I'm a commissioner
of Interplanetary Police!

593
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:33,105
This is my spaceship!
I tell you, you can't do that!

594
00:33:45,227 --> 00:33:48,617
Well, personally I'm quite happy
to be going to Draconia, Jo.

595
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:50,060
Perhaps we can convince the Emperor

596
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:51,785
what our friend here
has been trying to do.

597
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:53,937
You really think he'd believe you?

598
00:33:54,027 --> 00:33:56,700
Well, this won't be my first visit
to Draconia, you know?

599
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:59,460
Many years ago,
I spent quite some time there.

600
00:33:59,547 --> 00:34:02,220
I was able to help them through a period
of very great difficulty.

601
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:04,917
So there's a good chance
that they'll believe you, huh?

602
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:07,316
Well, it was a long time ago.
Things may have changed.

603
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:09,318
But I do understand
the Draconian mentality, Jo.

604
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:11,045
It all depends how you approach them.

605
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:14,437
So, if they do believe the Doctor,
you've had it!

606
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:16,722
Perhaps, Miss Grant, perhaps.

607
00:34:16,927 --> 00:34:19,964
But one never knows
when help may be at hand.

608
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:22,402
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I think that this is going to be

609
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:26,765
rather a long journey,
so, uh, good night.

610
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:30,076
We'll wake you with a cup of tea
in the morning.

611
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:31,486
Thank you.

612
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:59,356
So, Father, once more
Earthmen have invaded our space.

613
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:03,156
You will address the Emperor
in a proper manner.

614
00:35:03,247 --> 00:35:04,396
Your pardon.

615
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:07,445
May I have permission
to address the Emperor?

616
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:11,925
My life at your command.

617
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:15,716
One day, my Son,
you will inherit this throne.

618
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:19,800
Then you will realise
the importance of due formality.

619
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:22,685
Now, what do you wish to say?

620
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:26,203
Surely, now you will declare war
upon the Earthmen?

621
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:28,437
Let me lead your battle fleets
to crush their...

622
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:31,087
They too, have battle fleets, my Son.

623
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:34,000
Such a war could
well bring down both empires.

624
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:37,238
Not if we strike first,
then we shall be the victors!

625
00:35:37,327 --> 00:35:40,763
In such a war, there are no victors.

626
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,600
The nobles of the court
are demanding action.

627
00:35:43,687 --> 00:35:45,678
They fear for the honour of Draconia.

628
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:51,205
I am the emperor!
The honour of Draconia is vested in me.

629
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:55,200
The throne depends upon
the great families for support.

630
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:58,006
Emperors have been deposed before now.

631
00:35:58,087 --> 00:36:01,841
An emperor who does not rule
deposes himself!

632
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:04,798
Then what will you do, Father?

633
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:07,845
I shall question these Earthmen myself.

634
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:09,963
I have already sent for them.

635
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:12,720
Why waste time listening to their lies?

636
00:36:19,247 --> 00:36:22,364
Majesty, I bring the prisoners.

637
00:36:23,007 --> 00:36:25,965
May I have permission
to address the Emperor?

638
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:27,476
Wait!

639
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:29,285
This is an insult!

640
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,803
My life at your command, sire.

641
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:36,445
How dare you address the Emperor

642
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,597
in a manner reserved
for a noble of Draconia?

643
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:40,882
Ah, but I am a noble of Draconia.

644
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:43,197
The honour was conferred on me
by the 15th Emperor.

645
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:47,439
The 15th Emperor reigned 500 years ago.

646
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:48,596
(LAUGHING)

647
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:53,158
Your Majesty, do not be taken
in by this ridiculous story...

648
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:54,760
Be silent!

649
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:57,399
There is a legend
among our people of a man

650
00:36:57,487 --> 00:37:00,718
who assisted the 15th Emperor
at a time of great trouble

651
00:37:00,807 --> 00:37:06,165
when we were almost overwhelmed
by a great plague from outer space.

652
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:11,844
But you could not be that man.
No Earthman lives so long.

653
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:14,487
Your Majesty,
this man that you speak of,

654
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,444
was he not known as the Doctor?

655
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:20,438
And did he not come to this planet
in a spaceship called the TARDIS?

656
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:21,846
He did.

657
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:23,963
Well, I am that man, sire.

658
00:37:24,487 --> 00:37:27,684
And I come from a race of people
that live far longer than any Earthman.

659
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:31,362
Even if I accept your claim,
you have broken our law.

660
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:34,837
Why did you violate Draconian space?

661
00:37:34,927 --> 00:37:38,078
Your Majesty, this man was,
and still is, my prisoner.

662
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:39,839
It is true, Your Majesty.

663
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:43,158
I did come here as a prisoner,
but I came willingly,

664
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:45,363
in order to inform you that
this man is plotting a war

665
00:37:45,447 --> 00:37:46,721
between Earth and Draconia!

666
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:48,957
All Earthmen are determined upon war.

667
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:51,607
Ah, but the Master is not an Earthman.

668
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,838
I'm sorry to have to admit it,
but he's a renegade of my own race

669
00:37:54,927 --> 00:37:57,521
and he's using creatures called Ogrons

670
00:37:57,607 --> 00:37:59,802
to attack your spaceships
and those of the Earthmen.

671
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:02,720
The Earthmen who attacked
our spaceships,

672
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:04,843
they have been seen many times.

673
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:06,918
I'm sorry,
but there you are in error, sir.

674
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:08,918
Your people have seen Ogrons,

675
00:38:09,007 --> 00:38:11,999
but they appear to them as Earthmen
because of a hypnotic device.

676
00:38:12,087 --> 00:38:13,645
It's true, Your Majesty.

677
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:15,797
When the Ogrons attacked
the Earth ships,

678
00:38:15,887 --> 00:38:18,037
the Earthmen saw them as Draconians.

679
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:21,483
Silence! Females are not permitted
to speak in the presence of the Emperor.

680
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:25,446
Your Majesty, do not be deceived
by the pathetic ravings

681
00:38:25,527 --> 00:38:27,802
of two criminals
trying to evade justice.

682
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:31,641
If what you say is true,
it would explain much.

683
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:34,287
We lived at peace with the Earthmen
for many years,

684
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:37,404
then suddenly they began
to raid our spaceships.

685
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:40,843
When we protested,
they said that we were attacking them.

686
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:42,883
In order to cover up their own attacks!

687
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:47,245
This is simply a plot of the Earthmen
to lull us into false security.

688
00:38:50,047 --> 00:38:51,196
Speak!

689
00:38:51,607 --> 00:38:53,518
Your Majesty, a spaceship from Earth

690
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:56,201
seeks permission to land
in the palace spaceport.

691
00:38:56,287 --> 00:38:59,438
They say they're on a special mission
from the President of Earth.

692
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:01,563
This is a trick!
You must not allow them to land!

693
00:39:01,647 --> 00:39:03,922
We are not yet at war with Earth.

694
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:07,079
I shall hear what
their president has to say.

695
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:08,725
I give my permission.

696
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,240
Your Majesty.

697
00:39:10,327 --> 00:39:12,363
A wise decision, Your Majesty.

698
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:14,278
For only by Earth and Draconia
working together

699
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:16,358
can we hope to arrive at the truth.

700
00:39:16,447 --> 00:39:18,836
I, too, welcome your wisdom,
Your Majesty.

701
00:39:18,927 --> 00:39:22,044
Nobody could be more devoted
to the cause of peace than I.

702
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:24,243
As a commissioner of Earth's
Interplanetary Police,

703
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:27,524
I have devoted my life
to the cause of law and order.

704
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:30,644
And law and order can only exist
in a time of peace.

705
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:32,877
You feeling all right, old chap?

706
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:35,686
Only during a period
of social stability,

707
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:38,600
can society adequately
deal with criminals

708
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:40,279
such as this man
and this unfortunate girl.

709
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:41,402
(HYPNOTIC PULSE SOUNDING)

710
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:44,001
Doctor, listen! That sound!

711
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,195
PRINCE: Silence, female!

712
00:39:46,287 --> 00:39:47,515
Quiet!

713
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:50,644
It's the same noise
that I heard on the cargo ship.

714
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:51,921
Doctor, it's the Ogrons!

715
00:39:52,007 --> 00:39:54,726
Your Majesty,
I beg of you to be cautious.

716
00:39:54,807 --> 00:39:56,957
Something is seriously wrong here.
This ship that has just landed,

717
00:39:57,047 --> 00:39:58,446
I beg you,
place it under guard immediately.

718
00:39:58,527 --> 00:40:00,006
Your Majesty, please?

719
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:02,362
DRACONIAN: (SHOUTING) Earthmen!

720
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:05,398
MASTER: Seize them, fool!

721

(ALL GRUNTING)

722
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:11,286
Ah, you idiots!
Back to the ship, all of you!

723
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,403
Come on, back to the ship!

724
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:17,325
Now will you believe
in the treachery of the Earthmen?

725
00:40:17,407 --> 00:40:20,558
Your Majesty, look down here
and tell me, what do you see?

726
00:40:20,647 --> 00:40:22,239
(HYPNOTIC PULSE SOUNDING)

727
00:40:24,807 --> 00:40:27,480
I see one of your Earth soldiers

728
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:31,003
who attacked my palace
and killed my people.

729
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:33,840
Jo? Jo, can you still hear that sound?

730
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:34,962
(HYPNOTIC PULSE FADING)

731
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:37,515
Yes, it's fading. It's almost gone.

732
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:39,325
Your Majesty, I beg of you, please.
Look again.

733
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:41,602
Why do we delay? Destroy him!

734
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:43,482
Wait!

735
00:40:46,887 --> 00:40:49,685
He has spoken the truth.

736
00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:02,197
Great, lumbering idiots!

737
00:41:02,287 --> 00:41:06,121
Now you tell me that you've left
one of your fellows in the palace!

738
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:07,879
Do you realise what this means?

739
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:10,481
As soon as the effect
of the hypno-sound wears off,

740
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:13,479
the Draconians will know
who it really was who attacked them.

741
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:14,716
You've ruined everything!

742
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:16,286
What shall we do now?

743
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:19,962
Do? There's only one thing we can do.

744
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:22,242
Make sure that the Doctor
and his evidence

745
00:41:22,327 --> 00:41:24,636
is never allowed to reach Earth.

746
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:32,477
Why does the Master want war
between Earth and Draconia?

747
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:35,843
Did you attack our spaceships
and those of the Earthmen?

748
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,316
Oh, it's no good.
We're not getting anywhere.

749
00:41:38,407 --> 00:41:40,796
Let me take him for questioning.
He will answer to me.

750
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:42,400
I shall use the mind probe.

751
00:41:42,487 --> 00:41:44,557
You'd only be wasting your time.

752
00:41:44,647 --> 00:41:47,525
The Ogrons have got the finest
defence mechanism of all, stupidity.

753
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:48,756
They haven't got a mind
for you to probe.

754
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:52,203
Then remove him.
We will deal with him later.

755
00:41:55,207 --> 00:42:00,042
Why did that sound make us see
this creature as a soldier from Earth?

756
00:42:00,127 --> 00:42:01,958
Because you're frightened of Earthmen.

757
00:42:02,047 --> 00:42:04,242
Draconians fear nothing, female.

758
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:08,479
Well, of course you do.
You fear them and they fear you.

759
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,718
That's why when Earthmen
heard that sound, they saw Draconians.

760
00:42:11,807 --> 00:42:13,081
That is true.

761
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:18,287
We do fear the Earthmen
and they fear us.

762
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:20,801
And fear breeds hatred, Your Majesty.

763
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:24,197
Fear is the greatest enemy of them all,
for fear leads us to war.

764
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:27,438
We shall tell the Earthmen
what has happened here.

765
00:42:27,527 --> 00:42:29,358
They, too, must know the truth.

766
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:31,085
They will not believe us.

767
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:32,805
The Prince is right, Your Majesty.

768
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:35,959
We must mount an expedition at once
and we must take the Ogron as evidence.

769
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:38,197
The empires are on the verge of war.

770
00:42:38,287 --> 00:42:40,198
A Draconian spaceship in Earth space

771
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:43,723
could be destroyed before it
reaches its destination.

772
00:42:43,807 --> 00:42:45,763
We could use the ship
the Master brought us in.

773
00:42:45,847 --> 00:42:47,166
It's an Earth police spaceship.

774
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:49,283
Females are not permitted to speak...

775
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,766
The female may speak.

776
00:42:50,847 --> 00:42:53,077
-But...
-We must respect

777
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:56,796
the customs of our guests,
strange though they may be.

778
00:42:56,887 --> 00:42:58,798
The suggestion had merit.

779
00:42:58,887 --> 00:43:00,684
Thank you, Your Majesty.

780
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:02,837
You too, will go on this mission.

781
00:43:02,927 --> 00:43:05,646
But it must be headed
by a Draconian of noble rank.

782
00:43:05,727 --> 00:43:07,877
I shall send my son.

783
00:43:14,447 --> 00:43:16,119
Doctor, where are we?

784
00:43:16,207 --> 00:43:18,596
We're just about to cross
the frontier into Earth space.

785
00:43:18,687 --> 00:43:20,166
Ooh, that's good.

786
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:22,761
Unless your Earth people destroy us.

787
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:25,077
Well, this is an Earth police spaceship,
you know, sir.

788
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,078
Even if it is stolen.

789
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,397
What is that?

790
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:31,637
DOCTOR: It looks like another spaceship.

791
00:43:31,727 --> 00:43:33,957
It appears to be following us.

on the visual scanner now.

No, no, it might be possible
to take the Doctor alive after all.

00:46:27,247 --> 00:46:29,761
But he'll get to see the President,
eventually.

848
00:46:29,847 --> 00:46:30,882
She won't believe him.

849
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:34,357
Oh, yes, she will,
when she sees the Ogron prisoner.

850
00:46:34,447 --> 00:46:36,119
He's our evidence.

851
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:40,725
Your evidence is standing
right behind you.

852
00:46:43,527 --> 00:46:47,076
The Draconian Prince knows
the truth and he's with the Doctor.

853
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:51,604
My dear, Miss Grant, in the climate
of opinion that I have created,

854
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:53,166
do you think that any Earthman

855
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:55,283
is going to believe the word
of a Draconian?

856
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:00,043
Your Highness,
we've heard the Doctor's theory before.

857
00:47:00,127 --> 00:47:03,836
And, with respect,
there is still no concrete evidence.

858
00:47:03,927 --> 00:47:06,236
I myself would like to believe you
but, as you can see,

859
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:08,397
I need proof to convince my people.

860
00:47:08,487 --> 00:47:10,717
Then we must mount an expedition
to the planet of the Ogrons.

861
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:11,956
The proof we need is there, madam.

862
00:47:12,047 --> 00:47:14,163
With Earth on the brink of war,
how can we divert our forces

863
00:47:14,247 --> 00:47:16,317
into such a pointless expedition?

864
00:47:16,807 --> 00:47:19,446
My dear chap,
I'm not asking for a battle fleet.

865
00:47:19,527 --> 00:47:21,757
All I require is one small spaceship.

866
00:47:29,687 --> 00:47:34,715
Well, Miss Grant,
welcome to my humble abode.

867
00:47:34,807 --> 00:47:36,320
I think you were better off in prison.

868
00:47:36,407 --> 00:47:37,556
Oh, temporary quarters, my dear.

869
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:40,036
I shall soon be changing them
for something better.

870
00:47:40,127 --> 00:47:41,924
Oh, you'll soon be back in jail.

871
00:47:42,007 --> 00:47:43,042
When the truth gets out,

872
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:45,880
Earth and Draconia will combine
their forces to attack you.

873
00:47:45,967 --> 00:47:49,403
I don't think so.
There's too much distrust between them.

874
00:47:49,487 --> 00:47:51,045
The Doctor will find you, eventually.

875
00:47:51,127 --> 00:47:54,642
Ah, there I agree with you.
He must find me.

876
00:47:54,727 --> 00:47:57,366
Not only to rescue you,

877
00:47:57,447 --> 00:48:01,565
but also to be reunited
with his beloved TARDIS.

878
00:48:03,807 --> 00:48:06,958
Your Royal Highness,
could you convince your people

879
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:08,799
they were not being attacked
by Earthmen?

880
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:11,447
(SIGHING) If only we had proof.

881
00:48:11,527 --> 00:48:14,564
Then I could convince my people
and you could convince yours.

882
00:48:14,647 --> 00:48:16,638
But there's not much time.

883
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:20,356
Madam President, everything is ready.
We shall use my personal scoutship.

884
00:48:20,447 --> 00:48:23,280
We'd better leave at once.
Madam President.

885
00:48:25,847 --> 00:48:29,476
-My life at your command.
-Madam President.

886
00:48:36,287 --> 00:48:38,801
DOCTOR: Right, 34 seconds,

887
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:44,166
a course correction to galactic
coordinates 2349-6784.

888
00:48:44,247 --> 00:48:45,680
You realise where that will take us?

889
00:48:45,767 --> 00:48:47,837
A completely uninhabited sector
of the galaxy.

890
00:48:47,927 --> 00:48:49,918
Well, not completely uninhabited,
General Williams.

891
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:51,360
That's where the Ogron's planet is.

892
00:48:51,447 --> 00:48:53,642
No doubt your information
is better than mine.

893
00:48:53,727 --> 00:48:56,799
-May I ask where you obtained it?
-Certainly. From the Master.

894
00:48:56,887 --> 00:48:59,959
He fed the co-ordinates into his
ship's computer when I was his prisoner.

895
00:49:00,047 --> 00:49:01,685
And after you'd captured the ship, sir,

896
00:49:01,767 --> 00:49:03,803
I extracted the information
from the ship's memory banks.

897
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:06,037
We're simply wasting time...

898
00:49:07,127 --> 00:49:08,526
Dragons!

899
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,075
Let me talk to them, I shall explain!

900
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,520
Somehow I don't think
they're in the mood

901
00:49:12,607 --> 00:49:13,642
for explanations at this minute.

902
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,285
-Can you outrun them?
-This ship can outrun anything.

903
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:18,245
Hyper-drive. Max hyper-drive!

904
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:26,326
-Right, we're out of range now.
-Reduce speed, return to course.

905
00:49:26,447 --> 00:49:28,103
MASTER: They should be here very soon now.

906
00:49:28,187 --> 00:49:29,256
(DEVICE BEEPING)

907
00:49:29,347 --> 00:49:33,386
Judging by the size of the ship,
they can't be in any great force.

908
00:49:33,467 --> 00:49:38,621
So conceal yourselves and ambush them
as soon as they arrive, right?

909
00:49:38,707 --> 00:49:40,504
Hold on, wait a minute.
Something's happened.

910
00:49:40,587 --> 00:49:42,498
They must have landed very nearby.

911
00:49:42,587 --> 00:49:43,736
Right, send out patrols!

912
00:49:43,827 --> 00:49:45,419
Get them and bring them
back here immediately.

913
00:49:45,507 --> 00:49:48,499
And, remember, I want the Doctor alive.

914
00:49:48,587 --> 00:49:50,339
OGRONS: Yes, Master.

915
00:49:55,647 --> 00:49:59,401
One dominant life form,
a large and savage reptile.

916
00:49:59,487 --> 00:50:02,001
Yes, well, let's hope
we don't encounter one.

917
00:50:02,087 --> 00:50:03,440
Doctor, has it occurred to you
what we're going to do

918
00:50:03,527 --> 00:50:05,518
when we discover
the source of this signal?

919
00:50:05,607 --> 00:50:09,361
I've no idea, old chap.
We'll find out when we get there.

920
00:50:09,447 --> 00:50:11,278
Come on, can't be far.

921
00:50:35,287 --> 00:50:37,960
-Drop! Surrender!
-WILLIAMS: Take cover!

922
00:50:47,007 --> 00:50:48,076
(GROWLING)

923
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:49,725
WILLIAMS: What is that?

924
00:50:49,807 --> 00:50:53,083
I've no idea, but whatever it is,
it's on our side.

925
00:50:56,527 --> 00:50:59,360
Yes, I await your arrival
with the greatest of pleasure.

926
00:50:59,447 --> 00:51:02,837
And I shall be there to meet you
the moment that your ship touches down.

927
00:51:07,327 --> 00:51:08,999
(OGRONS GRUNTING)

928
00:51:11,207 --> 00:51:14,699
-So, where's the Doctor?
-The monster came.

929
00:51:14,787 --> 00:51:17,801
The monster?
And I suppose you all ran like rabbits?

930
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:21,926
-We fear the monster!
-You stupid, cowardly idiots!

931
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:23,804
You will answer
to your masters for this.

932
00:51:23,887 --> 00:51:26,685
-What? They are coming?
-Yes, they are coming!

933
00:51:26,767 --> 00:51:29,839
Which means that I can dispense
with your doubtful assistance.

934
00:51:29,927 --> 00:51:31,406
Out of my way!

935
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,126
Hello, Doctor!

936
00:51:41,967 --> 00:51:44,117
So here you are at last, eh?

937
00:51:45,047 --> 00:51:48,403
-Surrender or you'll be shot down!
-No, he's unarmed.

938
00:51:49,527 --> 00:51:53,440
Unarmed maybe, but not unaccompanied.

939
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,644
I've brought some old friends along
to meet you.

940
00:51:58,927 --> 00:52:00,565
(MASTER LAUGHING)

941
00:52:01,987 --> 00:52:03,941
Quite a touching little reunion.

942
00:52:05,227 --> 00:52:06,262
(MASTER LAUGHING)

943
00:52:13,587 --> 00:52:17,341
CHIEF DALEK: <i>Doctor, you are in our</i>
<i>power and you will be exterminated.</i>

944
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:20,499
-No, not yet.
<i>-You will obey the Daleks!</i>

945
00:52:20,587 --> 00:52:24,102
You know as well as I do
that this man does not fear death.

946
00:52:24,187 --> 00:52:27,099
I want him to suffer
a much worse punishment.

947
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:29,781
Look, my skill and cunning
has brought about this war

948
00:52:29,867 --> 00:52:32,381
which will make you
the masters of the galaxy.

949
00:52:32,467 --> 00:52:37,063
Leave the Doctor with me
and let him see the result of that war.

950
00:52:37,867 --> 00:52:40,097
Let him see the galaxy in ruins.

951
00:52:40,187 --> 00:52:44,499
Let him see the planet Earth,
that he loves so much, in ruins,

952
00:52:44,587 --> 00:52:46,384
then exterminate him.

953
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:52,185
<i>Very well. He will remain your prisoner</i>
<i>until the war is concluded.</i>

954
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:56,863
<i>Then you will bring him to us</i>
<i>and we shall exterminate him.</i>

955
00:52:56,947 --> 00:53:01,463
<i>We shall now return to our base</i>
<i>and prepare the army of the Daleks.</i>

956
00:53:15,987 --> 00:53:20,503
Oh, I suppose I should thank you
for saving my life?

957
00:53:20,587 --> 00:53:24,296
Not for long, Doctor.
It's going to be a very short war.

958
00:53:25,027 --> 00:53:26,858
Right, take them away.

959
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:43,823
-Hello, Doctor.
-Hello, Jo.

960
00:53:43,907 --> 00:53:46,057
Oh, so now they've got all of us.

961
00:53:46,147 --> 00:53:48,741
All except the pilot.
He's repairing the ship.

962
00:53:48,827 --> 00:53:53,025
Why do these Dalek creatures wish
to set your people and mine at war?

963
00:53:53,107 --> 00:53:56,702
'Cause war will mean the extermination
of both empires, Your Royal Highness,

964
00:53:56,787 --> 00:53:59,984
and the Daleks will emerge
as the supreme rulers.

965
00:54:00,067 --> 00:54:03,264
Now somehow, we've got to get
out of here and stop them.

966
00:54:03,347 --> 00:54:08,102
(WHISPERING) Doctor! Doctor,
would the Master's little fear-box help?

967
00:54:09,267 --> 00:54:10,336
Well done, Jo!

968
00:54:10,427 --> 00:54:12,065
You see, we could use it
to frighten the Ogrons away

969
00:54:12,147 --> 00:54:13,216
and then we can all escape.

970
00:54:13,307 --> 00:54:14,342
Well, that's hardly practical,
Miss Grant.

971
00:54:14,467 --> 00:54:15,866
They'd just run off
and we'd still be locked in.

972
00:54:15,947 --> 00:54:17,016
(SIGHING) Oh!

973
00:54:17,107 --> 00:54:21,862
There is one thing we can do, though,
and it'll need a very slight adjustment.

974
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:25,342
There's nothing to worry about.

975
00:54:25,427 --> 00:54:28,260
The Doctor will be perfectly safe
in my hands.

976
00:54:28,347 --> 00:54:31,100
And I promise you,
when I deliver him to you,

977
00:54:31,187 --> 00:54:32,905
he'll be a broken man.

978
00:54:32,987 --> 00:54:35,296
CHIEF DALEK OVER RADIO:
<i>Do not fail the Daleks.</i>

979
00:54:35,387 --> 00:54:37,264
The war is certain now.

980
00:54:37,347 --> 00:54:40,145
And once the great empires
have destroyed each other,

981
00:54:40,227 --> 00:54:44,539
I ask but one thing, let me rule
the planet Earth in your name.

982
00:54:46,027 --> 00:54:49,099
General Williams,
if we do manage to get out of here,

983
00:54:49,187 --> 00:54:51,621
and Jo and I manage
to create a diversion,

984
00:54:51,707 --> 00:54:53,345
could you find your way back
to your spaceship?

985
00:54:53,427 --> 00:54:56,260
-Certainly.
-Good.

986
00:54:56,347 --> 00:54:58,622
Right, that should do it.

987
00:54:58,707 --> 00:55:00,698
Now I want you to take off immediately.

988
00:55:00,787 --> 00:55:02,584
Get the truth back
to your respective governments.

989
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:03,702
Yes.

990
00:55:03,787 --> 00:55:05,459
Tell them that they must mount
a joint expedition

991
00:55:05,547 --> 00:55:08,903
-and capture this base at once.
-I shall stay and help.

992
00:55:08,987 --> 00:55:11,296
No, we'll need you to convince
the Emperor, Your Royal Highness.

993
00:55:11,387 --> 00:55:13,264
What about you and Miss Grant,
how will you get away?

994
00:55:13,347 --> 00:55:14,905
Jo, I presume that the TARDIS
is still here?

995
00:55:14,987 --> 00:55:16,659
-Yes, I know where it is.
-Well, don't worry about us.

996
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:18,544
-Our spaceship is here.
-That's all very well, Doctor,

997
00:55:18,627 --> 00:55:20,219
but we still happen to be locked in.

998
00:55:20,307 --> 00:55:22,741
Yes, well, would you mind
blocking your ears

999
00:55:22,827 --> 00:55:24,226
and covering your eyes
just for a moment?

1000
00:55:24,307 --> 00:55:25,456
I do not understand.

1001
00:55:25,547 --> 00:55:28,015
No, but I think you will in a moment.
Just do as I ask, would you?

1002
00:55:28,107 --> 00:55:29,665
-You, too, Jo.
-Oh, no, it's all right.

1003
00:55:29,747 --> 00:55:31,180
-I can resist it.
-Can you?

1004
00:55:31,267 --> 00:55:33,019
-Yes.
-Good.

1005
00:55:36,507 --> 00:55:40,500
DOCTOR: Uh, how much longer are you
gonna keep us locked in here?

1006
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:43,623
Yes, I'm talking to you.

<i>Open the gate or I will exterminate you.</i>

1010
00:55:58,347 --> 00:56:00,099
It worked.

1011
00:56:05,747 --> 00:56:08,580
DOCTOR: Right.
JO: Come on, then. Follow me.

1012
00:56:12,227 --> 00:56:14,218
CHIEF DALEK OVER RADIO:
<i>Do not fail the Daleks.</i>

1013
00:56:15,347 --> 00:56:16,780
(SCOFFING)

1014
00:56:17,267 --> 00:56:21,385
Right, we'll see who rules
the galaxy when this is over.

1015
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:24,101
(MOCKINGLY IMPERSONATING THE DALEKS)
"Do not fail the Daleks", indeed!

1016
00:56:24,387 --> 00:56:25,900
You stupid, tin boxes!

1017
00:56:25,987 --> 00:56:27,818
(OGRON GASPING)

1018
00:56:27,907 --> 00:56:29,306
Why aren't you guarding the prisoners?

1019
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:32,162
-The Daleks sent me away.
-There are no Daleks!

1020
00:56:32,247 --> 00:56:36,160
-The Daleks have all left the planet.
-The Dalek said to open the cell.

1021
00:56:36,247 --> 00:56:39,922
Did he now? Fetch the others!
I want them here immediately.

1022
00:56:44,887 --> 00:56:49,483
-Doctor, look at this.
-DOCTOR: Well, that's fascinating.

1023
00:56:50,247 --> 00:56:53,637
Is it some sort of idol?
I saw one of the Ogrons worshipping it.

1024
00:56:53,727 --> 00:56:56,195
Yes, I'm not surprised.
We've seen the real thing, haven't we?

1025
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:58,482
They're probably more frightened of him
than they are of the Daleks.

1026
00:56:58,567 --> 00:57:00,558
Right, come on. This way.

1027
00:57:05,527 --> 00:57:07,279
Right, you can get out this way.
Good luck.

1028
00:57:07,367 --> 00:57:09,005
-And you, Miss Grant. Doctor.
-General Williams.

1029
00:57:09,087 --> 00:57:10,884
WILLIAMS: Farewell.
JO: Good luck.

1030
00:57:10,967 --> 00:57:13,197
DOCTOR: Your Royal Highness.
PRINCE: My life at your command.

1031
00:57:13,287 --> 00:57:15,278
The TARDIS is over there.

1032
00:57:15,487 --> 00:57:16,522
Going somewhere, Doctor?

1033
00:57:16,607 --> 00:57:19,041
You know, you really are incredibly
persistent, aren't you?

1034
00:57:19,127 --> 00:57:23,564
-That is my property, I believe.
-Oh, yes, a most ingenious device.

1035
00:57:23,647 --> 00:57:24,796
I congratulate you.

1036
00:57:24,887 --> 00:57:26,445
OGRONS: Oh! The monster!

1037
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,721
(HYPNOTIC PULSE SOUNDING)

1038
00:57:35,407 --> 00:57:39,320
-Oh, Doctor, I thought you were dead.
-Help me.

1039
00:57:39,407 --> 00:57:43,400
Come on, yes. Careful.

1040
00:57:49,287 --> 00:57:51,005
-Help me into the TARDIS, Jo.
-Okay.

1041
00:57:53,927 --> 00:57:55,883
-All right, Jo.
-Careful.

1042
00:58:02,047 --> 00:58:05,323
The first thing we've got to do
is get out of here.

1043
00:58:06,847 --> 00:58:08,280
(WHOOSHING)

1044
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,926
(BEEPING)

1045
00:58:15,047 --> 00:58:16,639
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

1046
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:19,366
Doctor, what are you doing?

1047
00:58:19,447 --> 00:58:24,202
Telepathic circuits,
sending a message to the Time Lords.
