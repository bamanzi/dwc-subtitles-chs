We will deal with him later.

144
00:41:55,207 --> 00:42:00,042
Why did that sound make us see
this creature as a soldier from Earth?
为什么那个声音会让我们把这个生物看成是来自地球的士兵？

145
00:42:00,127 --> 00:42:01,958
Because you're frightened of Earthmen.
因为你们害怕地球人

146
00:42:02,047 --> 00:42:04,242
Draconians fear nothing, female.
龙族人什么也不怕，女人

147
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:08,479
Well, of course you do.
You fear them and they fear you.
得了，你们当然怕，你们怕他们，他们怕你们

148
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,718
That's why when Earthmen heard that sound, they saw Draconians.
这就是为什么当地球人听到这个声音时, 他们看到了龙族人

149
00:42:11,807 --> 00:42:13,081
That is true.

We do fear the Earthmen and they fear us.
我们害怕地球人，他们也怕我们

151
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:20,801
And fear breeds hatred, Your Majesty.
而恐惧滋生仇恨，陛下

152
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:24,197
Fear is the greatest enemy of them all, for fear leads us to war.

153
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:27,438
We shall tell the Earthmen
what has happened here.

The Prince is right, Your Majesty.
王子是对的，陛下

00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:35,959
We must mount an expedition at once
and we must take the Ogron as evidence.

We could use the ship the Master brought us in.

You too, will go on this mission.

Doctor, where are we?
