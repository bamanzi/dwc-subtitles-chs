Your Royal Highness,
could you convince your people

2
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:08,799
they were not being attacked
by Earthmen?

3
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:11,447
(SIGHING) If only we had proof.

4
00:48:11,527 --> 00:48:14,564
Then I could convince my people
and you could convince yours.

5
00:48:14,647 --> 00:48:16,638
But there's not much time.

6
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:20,356
Madam President, everything is ready.
We shall use my personal scoutship.

7
00:48:20,447 --> 00:48:23,280
We'd better leave at once.

-Madam President.

11
00:48:44,247 --> 00:48:45,680
You realise where that will take us?

12
00:48:45,767 --> 00:48:47,837
A completely uninhabited sector
of the galaxy.

13
00:48:47,927 --> 00:48:49,918
Well, not completely uninhabited,
General Williams.

14
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:51,360
That's where the Ogron's planet is.

15
00:48:51,447 --> 00:48:53,642
No doubt your information
is better than mine.

16
00:48:53,727 --> 00:48:56,799
-May I ask where you obtained it?
-Certainly. From the Master.

17
00:48:56,887 --> 00:48:59,959
He fed the co-ordinates into his
ship's computer when I was his prisoner.

18
00:49:00,047 --> 00:49:01,685
And after you'd captured the ship, sir,

19
00:49:01,767 --> 00:49:03,803
I extracted the information
from the ship's memory banks.

20
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:06,037

23

Somehow I don't think
they're in the mood

24
00:49:12,607 --> 00:49:13,642
for explanations at this minute.

25
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,285
-Can you outrun them?
-This ship can outrun anything.

27
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:26,326
-Right, we're out of range now.
-Reduce speed, return to course.

30

they can't be in any great force.

31
00:49:33,467 --> 00:49:38,621
So conceal yourselves and ambush them
as soon as they arrive, right?

32
00:49:38,707 --> 00:49:40,504
Hold on, wait a minute.
Something's happened.

33
00:49:40,587 --> 00:49:42,498
They must have landed very nearby.

34
00:49:42,587 --> 00:49:43,736
Right, send out patrols!

35
00:49:43,827 --> 00:49:45,419
Get them and bring them
back here immediately.

36

we don't encounter one.

40
00:50:02,087 --> 00:50:03,440

what we're going to do

41

when we discover
the source of this signal?

42

I've no idea, old chap.
We'll find out when we get there.

to frighten the Ogrons away
