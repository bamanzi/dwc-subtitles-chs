- How are you? All right? - Well...
- 你怎么样? 没事吧?  - 这个...

Right, they'll be plenty of time
for the exchange of social pleasantries.

Well, Doctor, this is an interesting reversal.
怎样, 博士, 这真是有趣的反转啊

I remember your once visiting me when I was in prison.

You know, I'd very much like to know why...

9
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:54,766
Why you've been locked up?

No, why I'm still alive.

00:26:57,687 --> 00:27:02,522
Oh, come, your health is very precious to me, for the moment.
哦, 得了, 你的健康对我来说很珍贵的, 至少目前是

You see, my employers are most interested in you.

- 是 Ogrons?  - Grant 小姐, 是我雇佣他们好不

you needn't expect any help from me.

Your simple presence will be quite enough.
你们只要出现就完全够了

00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:21,201
Oh, by the way, I need hardly warn you
there is no point in trying to escape.
哦, 对了, 不需要我警告你吧, 企图在这里逃跑完全没意义

18
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:23,198
This is an interplanetary police spaceship,

specially built for carrying prisoners, as you can see.

Stolen, of course?

(SCOFFING) Of course. Oh, and another thing...
当然. 哦, 还有一件事

22
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:34,119
There's a closed-circuit television
camera trained on you from up there,
这里有一个闭路电视摄像头, 对准了你

23
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:36,767
so you will be under continuous observation.

24
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:38,166
I think that's all.
差不多就是这些了

Well, now, if you'll excuse me,/

I have some rather complicated
astro-navigational calculations to work out.

May I ask where we're going?

on the remote fringes of the galaxy.

00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:57,917
That, Miss Grant, you will discover when you arrive.
这个, Grant 小姐, 你到了就知道了

32
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,397
Right, now listen to me. We haven't got much time

before he gets back to the flight deck.
要赶在他回到飞行舱之前

34
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,562
Now, the first thing we've got to do is to escape.

35
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,002
Now, they took my sonic screwdriver from me in the prison

36
00:28:11,087 --> 00:28:13,555
but they didn't get a hold of this.

37
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:16,764
- A steel file.   - Right, let's go.
- 一把锉刀?   - 对, 我们开始

38
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:18,997
No, not yet. Let's wait till he gets back to the flight deck,
不, 还不行. 先等他回到飞行舱

39
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:22,397
then he'll set the controls. Now, this is an automatic spaceship.
等他设定好控制, 飞船就进入自动巡航状态了

40
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:24,842
Once we're underway, the computers take over, right?
等我们一启程, 电脑就完全接管了, 对吧

-Okay, so what's the plan?
-Now this is what we're gonna do.

<i>So I told the High Council of the Time Lords,</i>
于是我就告诉时间领主最高理事会

43
00:28:54,587 --> 00:28:58,466
<i>I said they had absolutely no right</i>
<i>to put me on trial in the first place.</i>
我说他们一开始就完全无权让我受审

44
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:01,345
Well, if I chose to go wandering around the universe in my own time,
就是说, 如果我自己决定要用我自己的时间去宇宙里四处逛逛

45
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:02,496
that was my business.
那是我自己的事情

46
00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:04,179
What about stealing the TARDIS?

00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:06,861
I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it.

I fully intended to return it, I assure you.
我本来就打算还回去的, 我向你保证

49
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:11,178
Anyway, she wasn't exactly the latest model, poor old thing.
再说了, 它也不是最新的型号, 可怜的老古董

50
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,144
JO: (LAUGHING) You can say that again.
你又说这个

51
00:29:13,227 --> 00:29:15,866
I tell you, I made a complete fool of that prosecuting council, though.

I ridiculed his every argument.

Yes, and I told him that I had the complete answer

to every one his charges against me.

55
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,426
JO: And then what happened?

56
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:26,180
DOCTOR: Then what happened, well, they found me guilty,

57
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:28,986
changed my appearance and exiled me to Earth.

58
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,705
JO: And that's where you met me!
就是你碰见我的地方!

59
00:29:30,787 --> 00:29:33,460
<i>That's right. That's where I met you.</i>
对, 就是我碰见你的地方

60
00:29:33,547 --> 00:29:35,902
<i>And that alone made the exile worthwhile, Miss Grant.</i>
单单这个就让这次流放变得有价值了, Grant 小姐

61
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:37,136
JO: <i>Thank you!</i>
谢谢你!

62
00:29:37,227 --> 00:29:38,945
<i>Not that there's anything wrong with Earth.</i>
不过地球本身也没有什么问题

00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,541
<i>Well, it's quite a nice, little planet in its own way, but...</i>
嗯, 它很不错, 小小的星球, 有自己的风格, 不过...

<i>and I think I've deserve my freedom.</i>
毕竟, 我是一个时间领主, Jo, 我想我应该享有我的自由

-In reminiscent mood, are you, Doctor?
对啊, 又在回忆了, 是吗, 博士?

Poor Miss Grant, you have my deepest sympathy.
可怜的 Grant 小姐, 我对你深表同情

67
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:52,300
(CHUCKLING)

68
00:30:00,947 --> 00:30:03,222
As I soon realised, the trouble with Lethbridge-Stewart
我很快就发现, Lethbridge-Stewart 准将的问题是

69
00:30:03,307 --> 00:30:04,706
is that he's got a military mind.
他始终是军人的思维

70
00:30:04,787 --> 00:30:07,824
Well, he is a brigadier, after all. I mean, what do you expect?
但是, 毕竟他是一个准将啊. 我是说, 你还想他怎么样?

71
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:08,976
No, that's just the trouble though.
不, 那还只是问题的开始

72
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:12,423
He's hidebound, you see. He always does everything by the rules.
他很死板, 你明白吗. 他总是按照规则来做事情

73
00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:14,179
I keep telling him. I said, "There are times, you know,

"when you've simply got to cut right through the red tape."

And you've managed to do that, have you?

76
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:22,058
DOCTOR: Yes, I've managed to cut right through it.

77
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:27,946
And I'm not going to let authority stand between me and my freedom.

78
00:30:28,347 --> 00:30:32,420
(SIGHING) Lethbridge-Stewart, I...
Lethbridge-Stewart, 我...

79
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:37,183
Hey! As far as he's concerned
I've been absent without leave all this time.

Is everything all right, Miss Grant?
一切都还好吗，Grant 小姐？

Yes, yes, I'm fine.

83
00:30:51,427 --> 00:30:54,624
And how about you, Doctor?
No ill effects, I hope?

Doctor, are you all right?

JO: <i>Please don't wake him.</i>

00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:10,262
You come with me, Miss Grant.

Unless you surrender yourself
to me immediately,

00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:49,303
I shall open the outer door
and hurl her into space.

00:31:53,587 --> 00:31:56,420
What an ingenious fellow you are, Doctor!

Now hold it, Doctor, hold it!

Get that blaster over to me
or I press this button,

and that will be the end of Miss Grant!

100
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:18,179

Thank you, Doctor.

a bit more hospitable, old chap.

They've probably got us outnumbered.
得了，扔掉那把枪吧。他们很可能比我们人多

Welcome on board my ship.
To what do I owe the honour?

Why have you violated
the Draconian frontier?
你们为什么犯我龙族边界？

110
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:06,016
Uh, yes, I'm most apologetic about that,
but it was really beyond my control.
啊，是，我对此非常抱歉。不过情况真的超出了我的控制

You see, my prisoners
were trying to escape and my...

- Prisoners?
- 我的飞船又被抛出了航线

Yes, I am the commissioner
of Earth's Interplanetary Police.
是的，我是地球星际警局的专员FIXME

I'm not concerned in disputes
between Earthmen.

We shall take them to Draconia.
Put them in the cage.

But you can't do that!

I'm a commissioner
of Interplanetary Police!

This is my spaceship!
I tell you, you can't do that!
这是我的飞船！我跟你说，你不能这么干！

00:33:45,227 --> 00:33:48,617
Well, personally I'm quite happy
to be going to Draconia, Jo.
不过呢，我个人倒是非常高兴去龙帝国走一趟，Jo

123
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:50,060
Perhaps we can convince the Emperor
说不定我们可以说服皇帝

124
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:51,785
what our friend here has been trying to do.
让他知道我们这位朋友一直在干的事情

You really think he'd believe you?

126
00:33:54,027 --> 00:33:56,700
Well, this won't be my first visit
to Draconia, you know?
哦，这也不是我第一次去龙帝国，你知道不？

Many years ago,
I spent quite some time there.

I was able to help them through a period
of very great difficulty.
我在他们一段困难的时期帮了些忙

So there's a good chance
that they'll believe you, huh?
所以有很大机会他们会相信你，是吧？

130

Well, it was a long time ago.
Things may have changed.

But I do understand
the Draconian mentality, Jo.

132
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:11,045
It all depends how you approach them.

133
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:14,437
So, if they do believe the Doctor,
you've had it!
所以，如果他们相信了博士，你就有好果子吃了

134
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:16,722
Perhaps, Miss Grant, perhaps.
也许吧，Grant 小姐，也许吧

135
