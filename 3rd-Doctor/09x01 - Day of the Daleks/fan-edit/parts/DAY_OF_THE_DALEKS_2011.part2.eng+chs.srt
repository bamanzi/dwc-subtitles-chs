Let him go.

Now then - turn off that machine.
既然如此, 关掉机器

I have to report that we have lost the trace.
It was operating only a few moments.
我不得不说我们跟丢了, 它仅仅只开启了一小会儿

190
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:13,993
We are not interested in excuses.
Find them! Find them! Find them!
我们对接口不感兴趣！找到他们, 找到他们, 找到他们！

191
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:16,848
No last words of repentance, Sir Reginald?
死到临头了你忏悔不, Reginald 爵士？

192
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:20,950
No, only that you're making one fundamental mistake...
不, 你犯了一个很基础的错误...

193
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:22,050
That is?
是什么?

194
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,555
A question of mistaken identity.
I am not Sir Reginald Styles.
你认错人了, 我不是 Reginald Styles 爵士

195
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,749
Is that the best you can do?

196
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:31,685
But it's true! Sir Reginald...

I do not believe you.
我不相信你

It's all there in the paper in front of you.
Why don't you take a look?
这全都在你面前的报纸上, 你为什么不看一眼？

203
00:13:54,508 --> 00:13:56,466
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
很抱歉让你失望了

204
00:13:56,638 --> 00:13:58,112
It's a trick - kill him now!

205
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:00,295
If you are not Sir Reginald Styles

206
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:03,295
who are you and what are you doing in his house?

207
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:05,772
Well, believe it or believe it not,
I came here to see you.
嗯, 不知道你们信不信, 我是来见你们的

Who is in command of this mission?!
这次任务谁是指挥官？！

210
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:16,437
We are soldiers, not murderers.
Keep guard outside, I'll deal with these two.

00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:18,474
I said out!

00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:34,100
Now then, answer my question -
who are you and what are you doing here?
接下里, 回答我的问题 - 你是谁, 在这里做什么？

213
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,224
- I wanted to talk to you.  - Why?
- 我想来跟你们谈谈  - 为什么？

To find out where you came from.
And more to the point - when.

I can't speak to him now.

is happening at Auderly House./56.4

00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:01,791
Yes, what is it, Yates?
是我, 什么事, Yates？

A couple of my men missing, sir, 
and the Doctor and Miss Grant -
有几个我的人不见了, 头儿, 还有博士和Grant小姐

225
00:15:05,118 --> 00:15:06,850
- not a sign of them
- Look really, Yates,
- 他们一点踪迹没有  - 听着, 真的, Yate

226

I've got a major international crisis on.
I really haven't got time for any...

- One moment, sir.

Oh, that's better.

So much more peaceful.

you'll probably ask me a lot of fool questions!
不管怎样, 如果我放开你, 你就很可能问我很多傻问题！

00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:02,426
I've only got one question - who are they?

On the face of it, three rather desperate people.

Well, they're criminals - they must be!

241
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:07,599
Ah, you're prejudiced.
啊, 你这是偏见

242
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:10,398
Well, aren't you? They tried to kill you and me.
那你不是？他们试图杀了你和我

243
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,887
That's not in their favour, I'll admit.
那对他们也没什么好处, 我得承认

244
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:15,987
You know, we shouldn't really judge 'em
until we find out why they're here.
在我们搞明白他们为什么到这里来之前, 我们不能乱下断言

245
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:18,219
We are maintaining constant watch,

but there is no sign of any
time transference module in operation.

All criminal elements must be
tracked down and destroyed.

Well, I am doing everything possible, but...
是的, 我正在尽一切可能, 但是...

249
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:33,573
They will have returned to the time zone
where the first criminal was eliminated.

Of course... at once.

And the new equipment?

The Time Vortex Magnetron is set to the frequency
of the module that was traced.
时间涡流磁控管的频率, 已经调到与被追踪的模块一致了

254
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:56,077
Anyone using that module will be diverted
in the space-time vortex and attracted here.

255
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:58,484
But only if that particular module is used?

256
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:01,093
It is necessary to know the frequency.
知道频率是很有必要的

257
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:03,836
But surely no one will use the module?
They must realise that we can trace them...
但肯定没人将会使用这个模块？他们肯定意识到我们可以...

258
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:10,480
Do not dispute with the Daleks!
The function of the human is to obey!
不要跟 Dalek 争辩！人类的功能就是服从！

259
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,680
Activate the Magnetron!
激活磁控管！

260
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:26,257
...to base. Intercept to base. Do you coordinate?/?

Do you coordinate? Intercept...

262
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:33,622
No good. There is a massive disturbance in the vortex.

263
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:36,497
We cannot fail again. This is our last chance.

264
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:39,267
We must get fresh orders.
The time coordinates are crucial.

265
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:41,032
We cannot wait for new orders!
我们等不起新命令了！

266
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,400
Look, why don't I return to the tunnel?
There's better chance of contact there.
听着, 我为什么不回到隧道去？在那里联系的话机会大些

267
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:45,849
Right, Shura. Ask them...
对, Shura, 问问他们...

268
00:17:46,004 --> 00:17:48,781
Why ask them anything?
Isn't it obvious what we must do?
为什么所有事情都要问他们？我们必须做什么不是很明显吗？

269
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:51,081
We wait here and kill Styles.
我们在这里等着 Styles 出现, 杀了他

270
00:17:51,224 --> 00:17:52,385
And if we are detected?

We hold those two as hostages.
We kill them if necessary.

00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:56,958
Get alternative orders.
去看看有没有新指令吧

273
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:57,857
Right.
好

274
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:00,212
What do you mean, missing?

Well, there's not a sign of them.

We searched the house and the grounds, sir.

The Doctor, Jo and a couple of my men - vanished.

给我听着, Yates, 我已经跟部长通过电话了

我就是搞不明白。我是说, 为什么他们不回到9月12号去

286
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:31,470

you know, have another go.

On your feet, both of you!
