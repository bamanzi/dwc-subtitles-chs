1
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:44,839
Let him go.

2
00:12:45,913 --> 00:12:48,236
Now then - turn off that machine.

3
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:07,178
I have to report that we have lost the trace.
It was operating only a few moments.

4
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:13,993
We are not interested in excuses.
Find them! Find them! Find them!

5
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:16,848
No last words of repentance, Sir Reginald?

6
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:20,950
No, only that you're making one fundamental mistake...

7
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:22,050
That is?

8
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,555
A question of mistaken identity.
I am not Sir Reginald Styles.

9
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,749
Is that the best you can do?

10
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:31,685
But it's true! Sir Reginald...

11
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:37,695
Sir Reginald is at this moment many thousands of miles away - in Peking, to be precise.

12
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:39,383
You are lying.

13
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:42,697
No, I'm not. He flew there yesterday.

14
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,012
I do not believe you.

15
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,747
It's all there in the paper in front of you. Why don't you take a look?

16
00:13:54,508 --> 00:13:56,466
I'm sorry to disappoint you. 

17
00:13:56,638 --> 00:13:58,112
It's a trick - kill him now!

18
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:03,295
If you are not Sir Reginald Styles who are you and what are you doing in his house?

19
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:05,772
Well, believe it or believe it not, I came here to see you.

20
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,463
We're wasting time, Anat. Here, I'll do it.

21
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:09,928
Who is in command of this mission?!

22
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:16,437
We are soldiers, not murderers. Keep guard outside, I'll deal with these two.

23
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:18,474
I said out!

24
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:34,100
Now then, answer my question - who are you and what are you doing here?

25
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,224
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Why?

26
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,178
To find out where you came from.
And more to the point - when.

27
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:42,799
Two soldiers approach.

28
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:43,732
Hide!

29
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,028
Down there!

30
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:48,370
Hurry!

31
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,549
Captain Yates, sir, on four.

32
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:55,173
I can't speak to him now.

33
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:59,457
He says something very odd is happening at Auderly House.
If you could have a quick word with him, sir?

34
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,613
All right.

35
00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:01,791
Yes, what is it, Yates?

36
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:05,730
A couple of my men missing, sir, and the Doctor
and Miss Grant - not a sign of them.

37
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:09,950
Look really, Yates, I've got a major international
crisis on. I really haven't got time for any...

38
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,213
Oh, Lethbridge-Stewart?

39
00:15:11,374 --> 00:15:12,438
Erm, yes, yes, that's right?

40
00:15:12,571 --> 00:15:13,563
Yes, it's the Minister here.

41
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:18,512
One moment, sir. Listen, Yates, search the grounds
again or report back to me - out!

42
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:21,354
Yes, Minister?

43
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:25,513
Right, they're clear of the house. Have you finished?

44
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,858
- Yes.
- We must go.

45
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,111
Quietly!

46
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,132
Oh, that's better.

47
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:52,949
You know, I've got a good mind to let you
stay like that! So much more peaceful.

48
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:58,422
In any case, even if I released you,
you'll probably ask me a lot of fool questions!

49
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:02,426
I've only got one question - who are they?

50
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:04,821
On the face of it, three rather desperate people.

51
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,487
Well, they're criminals - they must be!

52
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:07,599
Ah, you're prejudiced.

53
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:10,398
Well, aren't you? They tried to kill you and me.

54
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,887
That's not in their favour, I'll admit.

54
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:15,987
You know, we shouldn't really judge 'em
until we find out why they're here.

55
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:21,819
We are maintaining constant watch, but there is
no sign of any time transference module in operation.

56
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:25,791
All criminal elements must be tracked down and destroyed.

57
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,329
Well, I am doing everything possible, but...

58
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:33,573
They will have returned to the time zone
where the first criminal was eliminated.

58
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:38,373
You will dispatch security forces to search for them.

59
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:40,795
Of course... at once.

60
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:42,943
And the new equipment?

61
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,577
The Time Vortex Magnetron is set to the frequency
of the module that was traced.

61
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:56,077
Anyone using that module will be diverted
in the space-time vortex and attracted here.

62
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:58,484
But only if that particular module is used?

63
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:01,093
It is necessary to know the frequency.

64
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:03,836
But surely no one will use the module?
They must realise that we can trace them...

65
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:10,480
Do not dispute with the Daleks!
The function of the human is to obey!

65
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,180
Activate the Magnetron!

66
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:29,857
...to base. Intercept to base.
Do you coordinate? Do you coordinate? Intercept...

67
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:33,622
No good. There is a massive disturbance in the vortex.

68
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:36,497
We cannot fail again. This is our last chance.

69
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:39,267
We must get fresh orders.
The time coordinates are crucial.

70
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:41,032
We cannot wait for new orders!

71
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,400
Look, why don't I return to the tunnel?
There's better chance of contact there.

72
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:45,849
Right, Shura. Ask them...

73
00:17:46,004 --> 00:17:48,781
Why ask them anything? Isn't it obvious what we must do?

73
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:51,081
We wait here and kill Styles.

74
00:17:51,224 --> 00:17:52,385
And if we are detected?

75
00:17:52,502 --> 00:17:55,197
We hold those two as hostages.
We kill them if necessary.

76
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:56,958
Get alternative orders.

77
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:57,857
Right./

78
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:00,212
What do you mean, missing?

79
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:02,305
Well, there's not a sign of them.

80
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,778
We searched the house and the grounds, sir.

81
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:06,304
The Doctor, Jo and a couple of my men - vanished.

82
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:10,436
Now listen, Yates, I've been talking to the Minister.
Styles seems to have pulled it off.

82
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,936
The Chinese have agreed to attend
and the conference is on again.

83
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:14,170
Oh, when's it fixed for?

84
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,235
Tomorrow night, so you see the spot this puts me in!

85
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:19,352
Get me Auderly House!

86
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,526
Where is he?

87
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:22,127
I told you, Anat.

88
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:28,170
I just don't understand. I mean,
why don't they go back to September 12th

88
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:31,470
if that's where they want to be -
you know, have another go.

89
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:33,634
Well, that's the Blinovitch limitation effect.

90
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:34,869
The what?

91
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:36,767
On your feet, both of you!

92
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,954
Honestly, sir. You're wasting your time -
he's not there.

93
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,993
Hello? Hello?

94
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:43,818
Doctor?

95
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:44,537
Yes?

96
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:45,444
Lethbridge-Stewart.

97
00:18:45,568 --> 00:18:46,255
Ah.

98
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,533
Is everything all right there?

99
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:49,849
Yes fine, Brigadier. Yes, things couldn't be better.

100
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:52,999
Yates and Benton came to look for you.
Said the place was deserted.

101
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:56,783
Did they? Oh yes, we were probably
down the cellar at the time. /56.8

101
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:59,783
Old Styles keeps a remarkably
good selection of wines, you know.

102
00:18:59,946 --> 00:19:03,106
Now listen, Doctor, you're sure that
everything is normal down at that house?

102
00:19:03,196 --> 00:19:04,746
Because Styles is coming back there tomorrow night.

103
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:06,768
Look, I... I don't think that's very wise, Brigadier...

104
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,396
Well, why not if everything's all right?

105
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:13,196
It is all right, isn't it, Doctor?
Captain Yates was very concerned about you.

106
00:19:13,364 --> 00:19:16,618
Well, you tell Captain Yates not to worry, everything's fine.

106
00:19:16,704 --> 00:19:19,118
And tell old Styles too, and the Prime Minister.

107
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:19,883
Right.

108
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:20,854
Oh, and Brigadier?

109
00:19:21,014 --> 00:19:21,606
Yes?

110
00:19:21,718 --> 00:19:25,168
Don't forget to tell it to the marines. Goodbye.

111
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,571
There you are, sir. I said there was something wrong.

112
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:35,236
I'm going down to that house myself.

112
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:37,364
Lay on a jeep for me, will you?
I'll meet you there later.

113
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:43,837
He's coming! Sir Reginald Styles is coming here.

114
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,577
Well that surprises you? Well, I should have thought
with your insight into the future...

114
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,277
oh no, in your case, it'd be the past, wouldn't it?

115
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:54,469
The conference tomorrow night -
our dates were right after all.

116
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:56,827
All we have to do is to wait here
until he returns and then...

117
00:19:56,985 --> 00:20:00,942
Right! Drop your guns! If you don't,
I'll smash this to pieces.

118
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,628
Jo, put that thing down.
I've only just got it in working order.

119
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,245
I mean it.

120
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:08,893
Stupid child! You do not know what you are doing!

121
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:13,720
Oh yes I do - you're going to let us both out
- or you'll be stranded here for ever.

122
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:16,073
We don't need that machine. We have another one.

123
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,836
The man who owned that machine is dead.
His body is back in our time zone.

124
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,712
You're... bluffing.

125
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,376
Put it down and don't be silly!

126
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,749
Jo, do as she says.

127
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:29,614
Drop it... drop it!

128
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,715
Jo! Jo!

129
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:56,582
Look, can't you do anything?

130
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:58,377
No, it's too late.

131
00:20:58,552 --> 00:21:00,180
Well, what... what's happened to her?

132
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,126
Disintegrated, dispersed around the time vortex.

133
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,362
If she was lucky.

134
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,555
And if she wasn't?

135
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:08,104
Re-embodied in the twenty-second century.

136
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,365
Believe me, she would be better off dead.

137
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:17,049
You may go.

138
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,766
You see, they're really not as terrifying as they look.

139
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,453
What are they?

140
00:21:32,678 --> 00:21:35,746
Ogrons. They're a form of higher anthropoid.

140
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:39,446
They used to live in scattered communities
on one of the outer planets.

140
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:40,946
They make very useful servants.

141
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:43,354
Servants? Well, what do they do?

142
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:47,092
Oh, we use them as... policemen.

143
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:53,031
They're very simple, very honest, very loyal.

144
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:55,099
Do please sit down.

145
00:21:55,403 --> 00:21:56,365
Thank you.

146
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:01,062
Is this really the... twenty-second century?

147
00:22:01,244 --> 00:22:06,516
Oh, don't worry. We can return you to
your own time, but, er, tell me Miss, erm?

148
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:07,818
Grant, Jo Grant.

149
00:22:07,947 --> 00:22:13,596
Miss Grant... these three people
who attacked you - what did you make of them?

150
00:22:13,762 --> 00:22:16,683
Well, they were sort of... guerillas, I suppose.

151
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,293
They are cruel and ruthless fanatics.

152
00:22:20,444 --> 00:22:21,302
You know who they are?

153
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,506
Unfortunately, yes. But what you don't know,
is how lucky you are

153
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,106
that they didn't get rid of you straight away.

154
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:29,970
They tried to kill the Doctor.

155
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:33,378
He's still with them, is he - this friend of yours?

156
00:22:33,507 --> 00:22:35,196
Yes, they're holding him prisoner.

157
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:39,385
Then I am afraid he is in very grave danger.

158
00:22:46,587 --> 00:22:49,264
But they've no reason to harm him!
They know he's the wrong man!

159
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:53,884
You don't know these people!
We have spent years trying to track them down.

159
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:58,784
If you knew some of the terrifying crimes
they have been capable of!

159
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:04,084
If anyone stands in their way, they are without mercy.

160
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,038
I can believe it.

161
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:10,925
However, there is a chance that
I may be able to save your friend.

162
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:12,271
Could you?!

163
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,671
I can try. There are means but I shall need your help.

164
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,568
Well, how can I help?

165
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:22,177
Well, first of all, I shall want to know exactly
where you came from... and when.

166
00:23:22,677 --> 00:23:26,603
Well, we were at Sir Reginald Styles' house,
about... fifty miles from London.

167
00:23:26,747 --> 00:23:31,642
Now, you've told me the year,
can you tell me the exact date?

168
00:23:31,838 --> 00:23:34,541
That's easy - it was September the 13th.

169
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,576
Excellent.

170
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:42,731
Now, you must be tired, you must be hungry.
We do have special guest rooms.

171
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:47,728
Leave everything to me.
Oh, there is one last question...

171
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:52,328
these criminals - can you tell me exactly
where they entered your time?

171
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:55,828
I mean, did they manifest themselves in the house itself?

172
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,440
I don't think so.

173
00:23:57,606 --> 00:24:00,622
Somewhere outside the house - some hiding place?

174
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:05,444
I don't know for sure, but there's a tunnel
by a canal, not far from the house.

174
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:09,344
We found that... time machine there.

175
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:17,248
A tunnel? Thank you.
I'll call you as soon as we have any news.

176
00:24:28,436 --> 00:24:32,011
You see? She trusts me implicitly.

177
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:36,709
The criminals are using the tunnel as a transfer point.

177
00:24:36,787 --> 00:24:42,109
We will prepare an ambush in the twentieth-century time zone.

178
00:24:42,408 --> 00:24:48,642
We have security forces in the area. With any luck,
they will drive the guerillas straight into our hands.

179
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:03,229
Anat! Look!

180
00:25:04,164 --> 00:25:05,133
Shoot!

181
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:13,268
Pull back!

182
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:16,802
We can get through the library. Come!

183
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:20,305
Stay where you are! Boaz, get out!

184
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,029
Boaz, come on!

185
00:25:23,243 --> 00:25:27,045
Come on, Boaz, out! Out, out!

186
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:35,383
How do you do?

187
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:56,895
Doctor, what on earth's going on?

188
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,820
Thank you, Brigadier, for that timely intervention.

189
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:02,100
Who is that creature.

190
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,646
Yes, well, I'll explain about him later.
Excuse me, old chap, I'm in a hurry.
