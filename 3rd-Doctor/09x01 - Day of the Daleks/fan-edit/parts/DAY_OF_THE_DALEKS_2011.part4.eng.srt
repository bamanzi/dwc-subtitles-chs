1
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:51,887
Stop! You mustn't kill him!

2
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:54,800
<i>- Be silent.</i>
- Don't you realise he can help us?

3
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:58,357
<i>The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks.</i>

4
00:32:58,447 --> 00:33:00,244
<i>How can he help us?</i>

5
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:03,524
He is our contact with the guerrillas.
He has valuable information.

6
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,883
<i>- You have proof of this?</i>
- I know he's working for them.

7
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:11,677
<i>We will force the truth from him</i>
<i>with the mind analysis machine.</i>

8
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:13,246
But look at him!

9
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:16,603
You've practically killed him just
getting a simple admission of identity.

10
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:18,803
He'll die before
he tells you anything else.

11
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:20,798
<i>What is your plan?</i>

12
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:23,681
Let me interrogate him.

13
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,917
<i>Why should you be more successful?</i>

14
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:28,919
Because I understand human psychology.

15
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,759
I shall be able to gain his confidence.

16
00:33:30,847 --> 00:33:32,838
To put pressure on him through the girl.

17
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,282
By the time I have finished with him,

18
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:39,679
I shall be able to crush the guerrilla
organisation entirely!

19
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:41,126
<i>Release him.</i>

20
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:47,776
Now, the control centre is here.

21
00:33:47,947 --> 00:33:51,064
As far as we know, they're being held
prisoner in this block here.

22
00:33:51,187 --> 00:33:52,381
And how do we get through?

23
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:55,061
The disused underground railway of the old city.

24
00:33:55,147 --> 00:33:56,865
There's an exit right by this wall.

25
00:33:57,027 --> 00:33:59,416
I know the Doctor
would help you if he could.

26
00:33:59,507 --> 00:34:02,943
I am trying to help him!
I've already saved his life.

27
00:34:03,027 --> 00:34:04,176
Yes, for your own purposes.

28
00:34:04,267 --> 00:34:08,465
Look, if you do not tell me where they operate from,
what their plans are,

29
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:12,063
then the Daleks will destroy both of you.

30
00:34:13,147 --> 00:34:14,785
I don't doubt it.

31
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:16,825
Do you value life so little?

32
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:18,977
On the contrary, I value it enormously.

33
00:34:20,507 --> 00:34:22,543
The Daleks will kill us whatever we tell you.

34
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,185
Not if you cooperate with them.

35
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:26,656
As you cooperate with them?

36
00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:28,624
Do you really think that makes any difference?

37
00:34:28,707 --> 00:34:31,904
- They can be reasonable!
- Reasonable?

38
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,182
They tolerate you as long as you're useful to them.

39
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:36,178
I am a senior government official.

40
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:39,100
You, sir, you, sir, are a traitor!

41
00:34:39,187 --> 00:34:40,224
You're a Quisling!

42
00:34:40,307 --> 00:34:42,218
You do not understand!

43
00:34:42,307 --> 00:34:44,867
We have helped make things better for the others.

44
00:34:44,987 --> 00:34:48,263
We have gained concessions. I have saved lives!

45
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:51,896
Wouldn't you have helped more
by organising the fight against them?

46
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:54,421
No one can fight against the Daleks.

47
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:57,704
That's not what your criminal guerrillas
seem to think, is it?

48
00:34:57,787 --> 00:35:00,062
A handful of fanatics?

49
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:02,900
Most of them have been killed already.

50
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:08,141
I assure you, there is nothing
they can do to change things.

51
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:24,184
<i>- Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>
- Anat, look out!

52
00:35:40,587 --> 00:35:42,657
Come! We must reach the control centre, come!

53
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,297
No! Come! Come!

54
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:53,239
For the last time, I tell you
I haven't got any information.

55
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:55,719
And quite frankly, even if I had,
I wouldn't give it to you!

56
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:57,286
- Right, stay where you are!
- Guards!

57
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:59,676
Guards? You have no guards. They're all dead.

58
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:01,359
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

59
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:03,961
- All the better for seeing you.
- You're coming with us.

60
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:06,277
No harm must come to these two.
Too much depends on them.

61
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:09,439
- As for you, my friend...
- Put that gun down!

62
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:11,686
There's no point in murdering him.

63
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:13,405
You don't know how much
blood there is on his hands.

64
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:15,125
Nevertheless, he's not your real enemy.

65
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:17,437
He's helped the Daleks. He's worked for them!

66
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:20,121
They would always have found someone.

67
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:21,196
Now, just leave him.

68
00:36:24,127 --> 00:36:25,719
Right, let's go.

69
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:42,762
- But how do you know this?
- Oh, there are books.

70
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:45,645
Even during the wars, people found time
to study, to write about it.

71
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:48,241
What to you has not yet happened
is to us history.

72
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:50,795
This history of yours,
it talks about Sir Reginald Styles?

73
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:53,037
Oh, yeah, he pretended to be working for peace,

74
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,879
but really he just wanted power for himself.

75
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:56,878
So the conference he called was just a trick?

76
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,481
He managed to lure the world leaders to
a remote country house

77
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:03,116
and he pretended they needed absolute
quiet if the meeting was to succeed.

78
00:37:03,207 --> 00:37:05,596
But then, there was a devastating explosion...

79
00:37:05,687 --> 00:37:07,757
And Styles was killed with the others.

80
00:37:07,847 --> 00:37:09,997
He must have set a bomb and mistimed the charge.

81
00:37:10,087 --> 00:37:12,362
There were accusations, counter-accusations,

82
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:15,359
and then the wars began. That was the turning point.

83
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:19,281
But if this true, Sir Reginald Styles
must be completely round the bend!

84
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:21,881
Er, so, you went back into our time

85
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:24,242
to kill Styles before he could carry out his plan?

86
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:26,397
Right. We've been fighting the Daleks for years.

87
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:27,476
But it was hopeless.

88
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:30,639
Eventually we must lose, so we thought,
what else can we do?

89
00:37:30,727 --> 00:37:32,080
We learnt through one of our spies

90
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,000
that the Daleks had succeeded
in creating a time machine.

91
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:38,762
We even managed to steal a copy of
the plans, and we built one of our own,

92
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:41,725
so that we could go back into history
to the exact point

93
00:37:41,807 --> 00:37:43,206
where things started to go wrong.

94
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:45,005
With one action, we could stop them.

95
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:47,442
Mankind could have a chance
to take a new direction!

96
00:37:47,527 --> 00:37:49,757
But even now, the transfer isn't always stable.

97
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:53,078
People materialised in your time
and then just faded away.

98
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:54,236
The ghost that Styles saw?

99
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:57,160
Somehow, somehow the Daleks
found what we were doing.

100
00:37:57,247 --> 00:38:01,001
And they sent Ogrons back into your time
after us and attacked one of our men.

101
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:04,159
Well, that must have been the man
that we saw down by the canal tunnel.

102
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:06,363
You remember, Jo, the one who vanished
from the ambulance?

103
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:08,324
Yes, we fixed on the tunnel

104
00:38:08,407 --> 00:38:10,967
as a place that was stable in your time and in ours.

105
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:14,244
We used it as a transfer point.
Well, you know the rest.

106
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,595
Yes, well there's... There's one thing
I don't quite understand and that is

107
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:20,997
why were you so keen to rescue us?
And believe me, we're grateful, but...

108
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:23,681
Well, you told us yourself,
you're an old enemy of the Daleks.

109
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:26,156
- Yes?
- Then you will help us to beat them.

110
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:28,486
What do you expect me to do?

111
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:31,035
Well, you can succeed where we've failed, Doctor.

112
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:35,319
We want you to go back into your
own time and kill Styles.

113
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:38,999
You're asking me to commit murder!

114
00:38:39,087 --> 00:38:43,000
No! We're asking you to kill one man
and prevent millions more dying.

115
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,282
- That is still murder.
- Isn't it worth it?

116
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,756
- To save the human race from the Daleks?
- Yes, but would it?

117
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:49,678
We've told you how it happened.

118
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:52,486
But your history could be wrong, you know.

119
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:57,243
Now, listen, why don't you
send us back to our time?

120
00:38:57,327 --> 00:38:59,522
We know the future now,
maybe there are other things we can do?

121
00:38:59,607 --> 00:39:01,484
Monia, we're wasting valuable time!
Every minute that goes by...

122
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:04,127
Doctor, will you help us? It's our only hope.

123
00:39:04,207 --> 00:39:07,961
I still can't believe that Sir Reginald
Styles is a ruthless murderer.

124
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:09,639
Yes, I agree, Jo.

125
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:11,877
Vain to the point of arrogance,
a trifle obstinate, perhaps,

126
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:14,276
but basically a good man.

127
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:19,485
So, if it happened, how did it happen?

128
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:24,837
Any of your people
still in our time zone?

129
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:27,441
- No.
- Well, Shura.

130
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:30,599
He left just to send a message and we
never saw nor heard from him again.

131
00:39:30,687 --> 00:39:32,006
We assumed he must be dead.

132
00:39:53,747 --> 00:39:56,839
Look, please believe me,
I'm completely with you about the ends.

133
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,681
I only disagree as to the means.

134
00:39:59,487 --> 00:40:02,001
All right. What do you want to know?

135
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:07,123
This mission of yours to the 20th
century, what did you take with you?

136
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:09,676
The usual battle gear, radio, disintegrators...

137
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:13,362
- Any sabotage equipment?
- Only a few charges of Dalekenium.

138
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:15,326
Dalekenium?

139
00:40:15,407 --> 00:40:17,637
It's a highly effective type of explosive.

140
00:40:17,727 --> 00:40:20,366
We stole the formula from the Daleks.

141
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:23,524
- Could it destroy a house?
- What are you trying to say, Doctor?

142
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,117
Well, don't you see? This has happened before!

143
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:28,640
What has?

144
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:31,756
You went back to change history,

145
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:33,997
but you didn't change anything,
you became a part of it.

146
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:35,998
What are you talking about?

147
00:40:36,087 --> 00:40:39,477
If Styles didn't cause that explosion,
somebody else did.

148
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,364
Well, obviously, but who...

149
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:43,602
Shura!

150
00:40:43,687 --> 00:40:46,440
Isn't that exactly what he would have done?

151
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,360
One last suicidal attempt to carry out his orders?

152
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,436
It's possible, I suppose.

153
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:53,121
You're trapped in a temporal paradox!

154
00:40:53,727 --> 00:40:56,366
Styles didn't cause that explosion
and start the wars,

155
00:40:57,527 --> 00:40:59,085
you did it yourselves!

156
00:40:59,967 --> 00:41:03,721
<i>You have failed the Daleks.</i>
<i>The Doctor has escaped.</i>

157
00:41:03,847 --> 00:41:06,042
He will be recaptured. I swear it!

158
00:41:06,127 --> 00:41:08,925
<i>He must be found and destroyed.</i>

159
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:11,441
He will attempt to return to his own time zone.

160
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:14,644
If those guerrillas are helping
him, they will use the tunnel

161
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:16,480
and I am setting up an ambush.

162
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:20,401
<i>If you fail us again,</i>
<i>you will pay with your life.</i>

163
00:41:20,487 --> 00:41:22,637
<i>This is your final chance.</i>

164
00:41:24,087 --> 00:41:26,647
I will go and supervise the operations myself.

165
00:41:35,007 --> 00:41:36,963
Is everything ready?

166
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:40,404
Security forces have covered the whole tunnel.

167
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:43,845
Don't worry, they won't escape a second time.

168
00:42:13,727 --> 00:42:16,195
So it has ended as I said it would.

169
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,120
Did I not tell you it was madness
to fight the Daleks?

170
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:22,563
Is it madness to want to see a world
free from their rule?

171
00:42:22,647 --> 00:42:24,478
- It can't be done.
- Oh, yes it can.

172
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:28,364
And I can do it. Are you going to stop me?

173
00:42:33,807 --> 00:42:37,595
Go. I will deal with these criminals myself.

174
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,921
I said go!

175
00:42:48,687 --> 00:42:50,518
If only I could be sure.

176
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:52,757
You spoke of the war,

177
00:42:52,847 --> 00:42:55,281
of its years of suffering and starvation.

178
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:59,804
Well, I can prevent all that happening, you know.

179
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:05,279
You saved my life. You could have let them kill me.

180
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:10,597
- Go, quickly.
- Thank you.

181
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:16,237
Jo, come here and stand by me.

182
00:43:40,647 --> 00:43:42,558
Sergeant! They're here!

183
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,364
This is Sergeant Benton calling UNIT HQ.

184
00:43:45,447 --> 00:43:48,120
Look, we've found them.
Will you get a Jeep over here pronto?

185
00:43:48,207 --> 00:43:49,322
This way, Doctor.

186
00:43:51,207 --> 00:43:53,641
I am sorry. They were too quick for us.

187
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,046
They escaped in the darkness.

188
00:43:55,127 --> 00:43:58,961
<i>You are lying You have betrayed the Daleks.</i>

189
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:01,880
No! I told you before,

190
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:04,527
those security guards
are no match for humans.

191
00:44:04,607 --> 00:44:07,201
<i>You are a traitor to the Daleks.</i>

192
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:09,721
<i>You must be exterminated!</i>

193
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:14,119
Who knows? I may have helped to exterminate you!

194
00:44:22,247 --> 00:44:26,559
<i>You have proved yourself worthy</i>
<i>to be the new Controller,</i>

196
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:33,082
<i>but be warned, the Daleks demand total loyalty</i>
<i>from those who serve them.</i>

197
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:34,486
Of course.

198
00:44:39,127 --> 00:44:42,915
<i>We must follow them into</i>
<i>the 20th century time zone.</i>

199
00:44:43,007 --> 00:44:45,601
<i>The peace conference must be destroyed.</i>

200
00:44:45,687 --> 00:44:47,245
<i>War must break out.</i>

201
00:44:47,327 --> 00:44:51,764
<i>The Dalek conquest of the planet Earth</i>
<i>must not be reversed!</i>

202
00:45:07,127 --> 00:45:08,958
Look, you're supposed to be in charge of security.

203
00:45:09,047 --> 00:45:11,845
Kindly get on with your job
and leave me to get on with mine.

204
00:45:11,927 --> 00:45:14,919
Brigadier! Brigadier,
get everybody out of this house at once!

205
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:16,156
Where the devil have you been?

206
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:17,885
Never mind all that.
Just clear this house immediately!

207
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:19,161
What's the man talking about?

208
00:45:19,247 --> 00:45:21,477
Do as he says! Look, there isn't much time!

209
00:45:27,047 --> 00:45:30,722
<i>Locate and destroy the peace conference.</i>

210
00:45:35,127 --> 00:45:36,879
<i>Exterminate!</i>

211
00:45:46,127 --> 00:45:48,402
<i>Destroy the human resistance!</i>

212
00:45:57,527 --> 00:45:59,677
<i>Eliminate all humans!</i>

213
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:01,116
<i>Exterminate!</i>

214
00:46:03,447 --> 00:46:04,960
<i>Exterminate!</i>

215
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:08,084
Brigadier, get this man and all the
delegates out of this area immediately.

216
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:11,239
Use force if you have to!
Jo, you stay here.

217
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:14,201
- Sir Reginald, please?
- No, I will not permit it!

218
00:46:15,327 --> 00:46:16,396
Shura!

219
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:18,205
Get out of here unless you want to die too!

220
00:46:18,287 --> 00:46:20,039
I must kill Styles to prevent the war!

221
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:21,446
Shura, listen to me.

222
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:24,758
Styles and all the delegates
are already leaving this house.

223
00:46:24,847 --> 00:46:27,441
You detonate that bomb and you'll be
sacrificing yourself for nothing.

224
00:46:28,127 --> 00:46:31,119
Benton calling UNIT HQ,
Benton calling UNIT HQ,

225
00:46:31,207 --> 00:46:32,356
we just can't hold them, sir!

226
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,324
Look, Benton, keep them back
as long as you can.

227
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:36,682
Sir Reginald, this house is under attack
by a hostile force.

228
00:46:36,767 --> 00:46:38,758
You will please consider yourself
under my orders.

229
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,485
- Brigadier, I warn you...
- Now be quiet, sir!

230
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:41,556
- Captain Yates?
- Sir.

231
00:46:41,647 --> 00:46:44,121
Get Sir Reginald and all the delegates
away from this area at once. 

232
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,640
Locate and destroy the peace conference!

233
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:29,881
Doctor! The Daleks, they're coming into the house!

234
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:32,481
- Daleks? You're lying!
- No, she's not.

235
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:35,639
They've come back to make sure that
their version of history isn't changed.

236
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:37,997
- Is everybody out of the house?
- Yes, everyone but us.

237
00:47:38,247 --> 00:47:40,920
Get out of here. Let them come in!
Leave them to me!

238
00:47:41,007 --> 00:47:43,475
- No, no! You must come with us!
- You don't understand!

239
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:46,559
That's Dalekenium. It's the only thing
that's effective against the Daleks.

240
00:47:46,647 --> 00:47:48,080
Well, couldn't we set a time fuse?

241
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:50,920
No, this stuff's too unstable.
There just isn't time.

242
00:47:51,007 --> 00:47:53,805
This is something that I must do myself.
Now, get out!

243
00:47:54,527 --> 00:47:57,200
- Very well.
- Out!

244
00:48:00,647 --> 00:48:02,205
Greyhound to Trap One,
Greyhound to Trap One,

245
00:48:02,287 --> 00:48:04,243
do you read me? Over. Greyhound to...

246
00:48:04,327 --> 00:48:07,444
Tell your men to fall back.
Let the Daleks into the house.

247
00:48:07,527 --> 00:48:08,562
Doctor, are you sure that...

248
00:48:08,647 --> 00:48:11,002
It may not make military sense
but it's the only way.

249
00:48:11,087 --> 00:48:13,806
All right. Brigadier to all units.

250
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:17,004
Let them pass! I say again, let them pass!

251
00:48:17,487 --> 00:48:19,398
Re-group on the main road, out!

252
00:48:21,847 --> 00:48:23,644
<i>Exterminate!</i>

253
00:48:24,887 --> 00:48:28,243
<i>Eliminate all humans. Exterminate!</i>

254
00:48:28,767 --> 00:48:31,725
<i>The human delegates are inside the house.</i>

255
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:33,399
<i>Enter and destroy.</i>

256
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:39,685
<i>- Where are the delegates?</i>
<i>- Where is the man Styles?</i>

257
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:43,282
<i>They must be found and exterminated!</i>

258
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:46,120
Oh, no, not this time.

259
00:48:46,207 --> 00:48:47,765
This time it's going to be different!

260
00:48:55,007 --> 00:48:56,440
Well, what happened?

261
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:03,479
Your conference has been saved, Sir Reginald.

262
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:07,477
Now it's up to you and your friends
to make sure it's a success.

263
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:09,558
- You still have a choice.
- Don't worry.

264
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,517
We all know what will happen if we fail.

265
00:49:12,607 --> 00:49:16,282
So do we. We've seen it happen, haven't we, Jo?

266
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:19,835
