00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:33,947
What the...?

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
<b>Day of the Daleks</b>
(Whopix fan edit)

4
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:16,051
Doctor, why don't you take a break?

5
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,615
It's maddening, you know. So nearly there.

6
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,615
If I could only cut out their override
on the dematerialisation circuit.

7
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,915
Let me see those figures.

8
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:31,313
Doctor?

9
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:33,369
I thought the TARDIS was working again.

10
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:34,612
What gave you that idea?

11
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:39,175
Oh, being dragged off to an alien planet
five hundred years in the future, for example.

12
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:41,575
Oh, you know - all that business
with the miners and the colonists.

13
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:46,332
My dear Jo, the TARDIS was being operated then under
remote control by the High Council of the Time Lords.

14
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:47,442
Well, if it worked for them...

15
00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:50,789
I don't want it to work for them.
I want it to work for me.

16
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:53,889
No-one's going to turn me into
an interplanetary puppet.

17
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,857
Yes, of course. Why didn't I think of that before?

18
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:13,182
Yes, of course. I remember now.

19
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:17,773
Look, don't worry, my dear. I know you're alarmed but you needn't be.

20
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:21,441
Yes, well I think that should do it. Why on Earth I never realised that...

21
00:02:21,783 --> 00:02:23,420
Oh no! What are you doing here?

22
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:24,590
Well, I'm not here. Don't worry.

23
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:31,190
Well, that is, in a sense, er, I am here,
but, erm, you are not there.

24
00:02:31,294 --> 00:02:34,290
Er... yes, well, it's a bit difficult
to explain really.

25
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:37,279
This won't do at all!
We can't have two of us running about.

26
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:39,341
Yes, well don't worry. It will all sor...

27
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,531
Doctor! What happened?

28
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:47,536
Well, it's a very complicated thing - time - Jo.

29
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:51,536
Once you've begun tampering with it,
the oddest things start happening.

30
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,917
But there was another you and another... me.

31
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,531
Well, where've they gone?

32
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:59,620
Back into their own time stream, of course.
Or do I mean forward?

33
00:02:59,631 --> 00:03:01,250
But, Doctor, I don't understand...

34
00:03:01,262 --> 00:03:05,233
Look, Jo. Don't worry about it. It was a freak
affect. It's very unlikely to happen again.

35
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:06,967
Hold that and give me those papers.

36
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:12,972
Ah, Doctor. Glad you're still here.

37
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,965
I need your help.

38
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,280
Sorry, Brigadier. I'm busy.

39
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:22,097
Yeah, so am I, Doctor, so am I. Now then,
you've heard of Sir Reginald Styles?

40
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,622
No, can't say that I have.

41
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:25,970
Well isn't he the chief representative at the UN?

42
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:28,322
That's right - key figure at the latest
summit conference.

43
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:30,537
My dear chap, I'm a scientist. Not a politician.

44
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:35,229
You know, Doctor, if you... didn't spend so much time
tinkering around with this wretched contraption,

45
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,629
you'd realise just how bad
the international situation's become.

46
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:39,966
Humans are always squabbling over something, Brigadier.

47
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:43,725
Yes, well, this particular squabble looks like
ending up in a third world war.

48
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:48,197
The Chinese delegation have refused to attend.
Without them, the conference can't even begin.

49
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:52,797
Now Styles is flying to Peking in a few hours.
There's just a chance that he can persuade them to change their minds.

50
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:55,926
All right, Brigadier. So what's his problem?

51
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,706
Well, he was working late last night,
down at Auderly...

52
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,700
Where's that?

53
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:04,392
Auderly, Miss Grant, is a Government owned country house
about fifty miles north of London where the conference is due to be held.

54
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:05,422
Oh.

55
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:11,113
He suddenly started behaving... rather oddly.
Seemed to think that someone was trying to assassinate him.

56
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,077
Any idea who?

57
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:13,929
Some sort of "ghost" apparently.

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,686
He said somebody attacked him and vanished.

59
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:29,643
And you're absolutely certain that he used the word "ghost"?

60
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:32,633
Oh yes. But afterwards he...

61
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:35,238
Miss Paget! What's going on here?!

62
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:37,242
These people are from UNIT, sir.

63
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:38,307
Who asked them to come here?

64
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:40,213
I did - because of what happened yesterday.

65
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:42,163
Nothing happened yesterday.

66
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,677
There seems to have been some sort of incident,
Sir Reginald?

67
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:45,819
Nothing of any importance.

68
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,868
Well, if you could tell us what happened?

69
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:51,531
I was working late. I must have dropped off.

70
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:56,531
Freak gust of wind, blew some papers off my desk,
I woke up rather confused,

71
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,231
I was picking up the papers when Miss Paget came in.

72
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:00,123
But you did mention ghosts.

73
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:02,728
Did I? Must have been having a nightmare.

74
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,524
But the French windows were shut. I closed them before I went to bed.

75
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:07,594
Then I must have opened them!

76
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:12,492
Did you, er, did you also make
those marks on the floor over there?

77
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:17,492
Muddy feet, Sir Reginald. Someone was in here, you know.

78
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:18,916
Are you accusing me of lying, sir?!

79
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:24,142
Sir Reginald, you've obviously been under considerable
strain recently. Were you feeling at all unwell last night?

80
00:05:24,243 --> 00:05:27,225
I felt, and feel, perfectly well.

81
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:30,825
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've a lot to do.
I'm due at the airport in an hour.

82
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:32,468
You've no objection to my men searching the grounds?

83
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,250
None at all. Though I really don't know
what you hope to find.

84
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,195
Sergeant!

85
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,699
Ah, he's in a bad way, poor chap.
You'd better get him to the hospital.

86
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:51,140
Captain Yates...

87
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,242
Right away, sir.

88
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:58,981
This is a new one on me.
What do you make of it, Doctor?

89
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:03,257
I'm not sure...

90
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:04,033
Sir?

91
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,537
What've you got there, Benton?

92
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:07,827
No idea, sir.

93
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:10,539
It was hidden about fifty feet inside the tunnel. 

94
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:19,362
Have you seen this before?

95
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:22,786
Really Brigadier! What sort of games are you playing?

96
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:25,167
It's not a game, sir. It's our duty to protect you!

97
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:26,762
I don't need your protection!

98
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:31,495
Sir Reginald, we've just found a very severely
injured man down by the canal tunnel.

99
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:33,755
Oh really? And what did he look like?

100
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:38,923
Thirty-fiveish, average build. He was wearing
a sort of guerilla combat suit.

101
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,371
And carrying that gun.

102
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:45,596
I am very sorry, gentlemen, but I have rather more important
things on my mind at the moment. If you'll excuse me?

103
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:47,447
I've arranged an escort to take you to the airport, sir.

104
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,908
Thank you, but it shouldn't be necessary.

105
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:50,500
I'm sorry, sir, but I think it will!

106
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:51,831
Oh, if you insist.

107
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,712
I'd like to get that gun down to the laboratory
and run a few tests on it.

108
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:05,162
Well, basically it's a form of ultra-sonic disintegrator.

109
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,361
You mean a ray gun?

110
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:08,514
That's right, Jo, I mean a ray gun. 

111
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:13,214
Only it's far more sophisticated than any weapon
yet invented on Earth. Now take a look at this.

112
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:19,825
Quite an effective little weapon, eh?

113
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:25,472
Doctor, you say this wasn't made on Earth.
Do you mean it comes from another planet?

114
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,479
Well that was my theory at first, yes.

115
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,779
But the metallurgical analysis shows that the,
er, iron constituent is very much of this world.

116
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,579
In fact, it was mined not very far from here - North Wales.

117
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:37,561
How do you explain that?

118
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:41,880
Do you believe in ghosts, Brigadier?

119
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,047
Let's be serious, Doctor.

120
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:43,952
I am.

121
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:45,592
Oh, come along, Doctor, come along.

122
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:50,514
Oh, my mistake. I was forgetting
the unimaginative nature of the military mind.

123
00:07:50,624 --> 00:07:54,014
But we saw a couple of "Amicus Seperatus"
a few moments ago, didn't we, Jo?

124
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:55,002
Did we?

125
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:56,525
Yes, here in this laboratory.

126
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:57,785
Oh, you mean when we...

127
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,497
Mind you, they were manifestations
of a much more benevolent kind.

128
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,997
None of your clanking chains and chilly fingers!
But ghosts, none the less.

129
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,742
That was because you were playing around
with the time mechanism on the TARDIS, wasn't it?

130
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,734
Still can't get it to work, eh?

131
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:18,388
Well, I can't get this thing to work, either.
But this is a form of, er, of time machine of a very crude kind.

132
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:19,735
How do you know?

133
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,105
Come over here. Look at this.

134
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:23,958
Now what do you think that is?

135
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,685
Ooh, it's a... mini-dematerialisation circuit.

136
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:29,653
Top of the class, Jo.
Now then, pop this in here, like that.

137
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,950
Now, as far as I can gather,
when you push this button, it should...

138
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:36,437
Good grief! It's working!

139
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:46,698
Sir?

140
00:08:47,182 --> 00:08:48,055
What is it?

141
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:51,092
Time transmitter in operation, sir.
Twentieth Century Zone.

142
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:53,365
Can you fix the space-time coordinates?

143
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:54,853
Do be careful, Doctor!

144
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,682
All right, Jo, all right.

145
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:57,605
Well?

146
00:08:58,127 --> 00:09:02,208
No good, sir. There was a transference,
I think, but the machine's cut out completely.

147
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:07,234
Continue scanning - and next time
you had better be more efficient!

148
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,417
Report!

149
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:16,695
Yes, I see. All right, sergeant.  You'd better
report back to Captain Yates. Goodbye.

150
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:19,807
That was Benton. He was in the ambulance
with the man we found.

151
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:20,920
Well?

152
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:27,999
Well according to him, that man just...
vanished, faded away - like a ghost.

153
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:29,246
Oh no!

154
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:30,904
Well, Doctor, what now?

155
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:34,166
Well, everything that happens seems to
centre round Styles' house.

156
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:35,532
Obviously.

157
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:37,604
And whoever tried to harm him will probably try again.

158
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:43,940
Jo, how would you like to spend the night
in a haunted house?

159
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:08,846
Wake up, Jo.

160
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:10,678
It's all right. It's morning.

161
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,052
Nothing's happened?

162
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:13,175
No, nothing at all.

163
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:50,901
Jo! Jo!

164
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:34,224
Please! Turn that machine off
- or they'll kill all of us! Please!

165
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:40,237
Sir?

166
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:41,219
Yes?

167
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:43,492
We've picked up that time transmitter again.

168
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:44,377
You're sure?

169
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:48,166
Yes, sir. Same frequency, same time...
time zone. Much stronger now.

170
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,427
Right. I want the exact space-time co-ordinates
so whatever happens, don't lose it!

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,300
What is your report?

172
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,436
We have a fix on the time transfer device.

173
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:07,436
It is operating again in the twentieth century
time zone and it must be them.

174
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:13,131
You have obtained the space-time co-ordinates?

175
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:17,819
We're trying now. The trace is much stronger
this time. There is every chance...

176
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:19,626
You must not fail!

177
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:27,778
Security forces are standing by. If we do get
the co-ordinates, what are your instructions?

178
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:36,737
Whoever is operating the time machine
is an enemy of the Daleks.

179
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:45,137
All enemies of the Daleks must be destroyed!
Exterminate them!

180
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:44,839
Let him go.

181
00:12:45,913 --> 00:12:48,236
Now then - turn off that machine.

182
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:07,178
I have to report that we have lost the trace.
It was operating only a few moments.

183
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:13,993
We are not interested in excuses.
Find them! Find them! Find them!

184
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:16,848
No last words of repentance, Sir Reginald?

185
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:20,950
No, only that you're making one fundamental mistake...

186
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:22,050
That is?

187
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,555
A question of mistaken identity.
I am not Sir Reginald Styles.

188
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,749
Is that the best you can do?

189
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:31,685
But it's true! Sir Reginald...

190
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:37,695
Sir Reginald is at this moment many thousands of miles away - in Peking, to be precise.

191
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:39,383
You are lying.

192
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:42,697
No, I'm not. He flew there yesterday.

193
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,012
I do not believe you.

194
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,747
It's all there in the paper in front of you. Why don't you take a look?

195
00:13:54,508 --> 00:13:56,466
I'm sorry to disappoint you. 

196
00:13:56,638 --> 00:13:58,112
It's a trick - kill him now!

197
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:03,295
If you are not Sir Reginald Styles who are you and what are you doing in his house?

198
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:05,772
Well, believe it or believe it not, I came here to see you.

199
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,463
We're wasting time, Anat. Here, I'll do it.

200
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:09,928
Who is in command of this mission?!

201
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:16,437
We are soldiers, not murderers. Keep guard outside, I'll deal with these two.

202
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:18,474
I said out!

203
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:34,100
Now then, answer my question - who are you and what are you doing here?

204
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,224
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Why?

205
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,178
To find out where you came from.
And more to the point - when.

206
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:42,799
Two soldiers approach.

207
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:43,732
Hide!

208
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,028
Down there!

209
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:48,370
Hurry!

210
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,549
Captain Yates, sir, on four.

211
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:55,173
I can't speak to him now.

212
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:59,457
He says something very odd is happening at Auderly House.
If you could have a quick word with him, sir?

213
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,613
All right.

214
00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:01,791
Yes, what is it, Yates?

215
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:05,730
A couple of my men missing, sir, and the Doctor
and Miss Grant - not a sign of them.

216
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:09,950
Look really, Yates, I've got a major international
crisis on. I really haven't got time for any...

217
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,213
Oh, Lethbridge-Stewart?

218
00:15:11,374 --> 00:15:12,438
Erm, yes, yes, that's right?

219
00:15:12,571 --> 00:15:13,563
Yes, it's the Minister here.

220
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:18,512
One moment, sir. Listen, Yates, search the grounds
again or report back to me - out!

221
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:21,354
Yes, Minister?

222
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:25,513
Right, they're clear of the house. Have you finished?

223
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,858
- Yes.
- We must go.

224
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,111
Quietly!

225
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,132
Oh, that's better.

226
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:52,949
You know, I've got a good mind to let you
stay like that! So much more peaceful.

227
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:58,422
In any case, even if I released you,
you'll probably ask me a lot of fool questions!

228
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:02,426
I've only got one question - who are they?

229
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:04,821
On the face of it, three rather desperate people.

230
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,487
Well, they're criminals - they must be!

231
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:07,599
Ah, you're prejudiced.

232
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:10,398
Well, aren't you? They tried to kill you and me.

233
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,887
That's not in their favour, I'll admit.

234
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:15,987
You know, we shouldn't really judge 'em
until we find out why they're here.

235
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:21,819
We are maintaining constant watch, but there is
no sign of any time transference module in operation.

236
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:25,791
All criminal elements must be tracked down and destroyed.

237
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,329
Well, I am doing everything possible, but...

238
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:33,573
They will have returned to the time zone
where the first criminal was eliminated.

239
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:38,373
You will dispatch security forces to search for them.

240
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:40,795
Of course... at once.

241
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:42,943
And the new equipment?

242
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,577
The Time Vortex Magnetron is set to the frequency
of the module that was traced.

243
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:56,077
Anyone using that module will be diverted
in the space-time vortex and attracted here.

244
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:58,484
But only if that particular module is used?

245
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:01,093
It is necessary to know the frequency.

246
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:03,836
But surely no one will use the module?
They must realise that we can trace them...

247
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:10,480
Do not dispute with the Daleks!
The function of the human is to obey!

248
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,180
Activate the Magnetron!

249
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:29,857
...to base. Intercept to base.
Do you coordinate? Do you coordinate? Intercept...

250
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:33,622
No good. There is a massive disturbance in the vortex.

251
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:36,497
We cannot fail again. This is our last chance.

252
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:39,267
We must get fresh orders.
The time coordinates are crucial.

253
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:41,032
We cannot wait for new orders!

254
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,400
Look, why don't I return to the tunnel?
There's better chance of contact there.

255
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:45,849
Right, Shura. Ask them...

256
00:17:46,004 --> 00:17:48,781
Why ask them anything? Isn't it obvious what we must do?

257
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:51,081
We wait here and kill Styles.

258
00:17:51,224 --> 00:17:52,385
And if we are detected?

259
00:17:52,502 --> 00:17:55,197
We hold those two as hostages.
We kill them if necessary.

260
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:56,958
Get alternative orders.

261
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:57,857
Right.

262
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:00,212
What do you mean, missing?

263
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:02,305
Well, there's not a sign of them.

264
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,778
We searched the house and the grounds, sir.

265
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:06,304
The Doctor, Jo and a couple of my men - vanished.

266
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:10,436
Now listen, Yates, I've been talking to the Minister.
Styles seems to have pulled it off.

267
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,936
The Chinese have agreed to attend
and the conference is on again.

268
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:14,170
Oh, when's it fixed for?

269
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,235
Tomorrow night, so you see the spot this puts me in!

270
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:19,352
Get me Auderly House!

271
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,526
Where is he?

272
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:22,127
I told you, Anat.

273
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:28,170
I just don't understand. I mean,
why don't they go back to September 12th

274
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:31,470
if that's where they want to be -
you know, have another go.

275
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:33,634
Well, that's the Blinovitch limitation effect.

276
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:34,869
The what?

277
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:36,767
On your feet, both of you!

278
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,954
Honestly, sir. You're wasting your time -
he's not there.

279
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,993
Hello? Hello?

280
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:43,818
Doctor?

281
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:44,537
Yes?

282
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:45,444
Lethbridge-Stewart.

283
00:18:45,568 --> 00:18:46,255
Ah.

284
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,533
Is everything all right there?

285
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:49,849
Yes fine, Brigadier. Yes, things couldn't be better.

286
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:52,999
Yates and Benton came to look for you.
Said the place was deserted.

287
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:56,783
Did they? Oh yes, we were probably
down the cellar at the time.

288
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:59,783
Old Styles keeps a remarkably
good selection of wines, you know.

289
00:18:59,946 --> 00:19:03,106
Now listen, Doctor, you're sure that
everything is normal down at that house?

290
00:19:03,196 --> 00:19:04,746
Because Styles is coming back there tomorrow night.

291
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:06,768
Look, I... I don't think that's very wise, Brigadier...

292
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,396
Well, why not if everything's all right?

293
00:19:08,537 --> 00:19:13,196
It is all right, isn't it, Doctor?
Captain Yates was very concerned about you.

294
00:19:13,364 --> 00:19:16,618
Well, you tell Captain Yates not to worry, everything's fine.

295
00:19:16,704 --> 00:19:19,118
And tell old Styles too, and the Prime Minister.

296
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:19,883
Right.

297
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:20,854
Oh, and Brigadier?

298
00:19:21,014 --> 00:19:21,606
Yes?

299
00:19:21,718 --> 00:19:25,168
Don't forget to tell it to the marines. Goodbye.

300
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,571
There you are, sir. I said there was something wrong.

301
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:35,236
I'm going down to that house myself.

302
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:37,364
Lay on a jeep for me, will you?
I'll meet you there later.

303
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:43,837
He's coming! Sir Reginald Styles is coming here.

304
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,577
Well that surprises you? Well, I should have thought
with your insight into the future...

305
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,277
oh no, in your case, it'd be the past, wouldn't it?

306
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:54,469
The conference tomorrow night -
our dates were right after all.

307
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:56,827
All we have to do is to wait here
until he returns and then...

308
00:19:56,985 --> 00:20:00,942
Right! Drop your guns! If you don't,
I'll smash this to pieces.

309
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,628
Jo, put that thing down.
I've only just got it in working order.

310
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,245
I mean it.

311
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:08,893
Stupid child! You do not know what you are doing!

312
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:13,720
Oh yes I do - you're going to let us both out
- or you'll be stranded here for ever.

313
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:16,073
We don't need that machine. We have another one.

314
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,836
The man who owned that machine is dead.
His body is back in our time zone.

315
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,712
You're... bluffing.

316
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,376
Put it down and don't be silly!

317
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,749
Jo, do as she says.

318
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:29,614
Drop it... drop it!

319
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,715
Jo! Jo!

320
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:56,582
Look, can't you do anything?

321
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:58,377
No, it's too late.

322
00:20:58,552 --> 00:21:00,180
Well, what... what's happened to her?

323
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,126
Disintegrated, dispersed around the time vortex.

324
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,362
If she was lucky.

325
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,555
And if she wasn't?

326
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:08,104
Re-embodied in the twenty-second century.

327
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,365
Believe me, she would be better off dead.

328
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:17,049
You may go.

329
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,766
You see, they're really not as terrifying as they look.

330
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,453
What are they?

331
00:21:32,678 --> 00:21:35,746
Ogrons. They're a form of higher anthropoid.

332
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:39,446
They used to live in scattered communities
on one of the outer planets.

333
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:40,946
They make very useful servants.

334
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:43,354
Servants? Well, what do they do?

335
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:47,092
Oh, we use them as... policemen.

336
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:53,031
They're very simple, very honest, very loyal.

337
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:55,099
Do please sit down.

338
00:21:55,403 --> 00:21:56,365
Thank you.

339
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:01,062
Is this really the... twenty-second century?

340
00:22:01,244 --> 00:22:06,516
Oh, don't worry. We can return you to
your own time, but, er, tell me Miss, erm?

341
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:07,818
Grant, Jo Grant.

342
00:22:07,947 --> 00:22:13,596
Miss Grant... these three people
who attacked you - what did you make of them?

343
00:22:13,762 --> 00:22:16,683
Well, they were sort of... guerillas, I suppose.

344
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,293
They are cruel and ruthless fanatics.

345
00:22:20,444 --> 00:22:21,302
You know who they are?

346
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,506
Unfortunately, yes. But what you don't know,
is how lucky you are

347
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,106
that they didn't get rid of you straight away.

348
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:29,970
They tried to kill the Doctor.

349
00:22:30,106 --> 00:22:33,378
He's still with them, is he - this friend of yours?

350
00:22:33,507 --> 00:22:35,196
Yes, they're holding him prisoner.

351
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:39,385
Then I am afraid he is in very grave danger.

352
00:22:46,587 --> 00:22:49,264
But they've no reason to harm him!
They know he's the wrong man!

353
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:53,884
You don't know these people!
We have spent years trying to track them down.

354
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:58,784
If you knew some of the terrifying crimes
they have been capable of!

355
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:04,084
If anyone stands in their way, they are without mercy.

356
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,038
I can believe it.

357
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:10,925
However, there is a chance that
I may be able to save your friend.

358
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:12,271
Could you?!

359
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,671
I can try. There are means but I shall need your help.

360
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,568
Well, how can I help?

361
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:22,177
Well, first of all, I shall want to know exactly
where you came from... and when.

362
00:23:22,677 --> 00:23:26,603
Well, we were at Sir Reginald Styles' house,
about... fifty miles from London.

363
00:23:26,747 --> 00:23:31,642
Now, you've told me the year,
can you tell me the exact date?

364
00:23:31,838 --> 00:23:34,541
That's easy - it was September the 13th.

365
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,576
Excellent.

366
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:42,731
Now, you must be tired, you must be hungry.
We do have special guest rooms.

367
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:47,728
Leave everything to me.
Oh, there is one last question...

368
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:52,328
these criminals - can you tell me exactly
where they entered your time?

369
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:55,828
I mean, did they manifest themselves in the house itself?

370
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,440
I don't think so.

371
00:23:57,606 --> 00:24:00,622
Somewhere outside the house - some hiding place?

372
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:05,444
I don't know for sure, but there's a tunnel
by a canal, not far from the house.

373
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:09,344
We found that... time machine there.

374
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:17,248
A tunnel? Thank you.
I'll call you as soon as we have any news.

375
00:24:28,436 --> 00:24:32,011
You see? She trusts me implicitly.

376
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:36,709
The criminals are using the tunnel as a transfer point.

377
00:24:36,787 --> 00:24:42,109
We will prepare an ambush in the twentieth-century time zone.

378
00:24:42,408 --> 00:24:48,642
We have security forces in the area. With any luck,
they will drive the guerillas straight into our hands.

379
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:03,229
Anat! Look!

380
00:25:04,164 --> 00:25:05,133
Shoot!

381
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:13,268
Pull back!

382
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:16,802
We can get through the library. Come!

383
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:20,305
Stay where you are! Boaz, get out!

384
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,029
Boaz, come on!

385
00:25:23,243 --> 00:25:27,045
Come on, Boaz, out! Out, out!

386
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:35,383
How do you do?

387
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:56,895
Doctor, what on earth's going on?

388
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,820
Thank you, Brigadier, for that timely intervention.

389
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:02,100
Who is that creature.

390
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,646
Yes, well, I'll explain about him later.
Excuse me, old chap, I'm in a hurry.

391
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:53,563
Get back! Get back!

392
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:54,907
Please! Wait! I've got to talk to you!

393
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:55,934
Keep away!

394
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,923
Exterminate!

395
00:26:58,309 --> 00:26:59,754
_ or you'll be caught in the time field!

396
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:20,095
We warned you.

397
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:22,508
Yes, yes, so you did.

398
00:27:22,677 --> 00:27:26,514
This may come as a shock to you, but you've just
travelled two hundred years through time.

399
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:32,471
Thank you. But I'm probably more familiar
with the concept of time travel than you are.

400
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:36,347
Now wait a minute. Before the time transference,
I saw a Dalek.

401
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:37,958
You know of the Daleks?

402
00:27:38,111 --> 00:27:42,096
Indeed I do. I know them only too well.
They've been my bitterest enemy for many years.

403
00:27:42,281 --> 00:27:44,193
Then you're a fool to have let yourself be brought here!

404
00:27:44,338 --> 00:27:46,617
Look, I came here in order to find Miss Jo Grant.

405
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:48,607
I told you, she's probably dead.

406
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:49,955
But as long as there's a chance...

407
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:51,048
Come on, Anat.

408
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,968
Wait a minute - what is my best way of finding her?

409
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:54,015
That's your problem.

410
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:55,223
We can't just leave him!

411
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,305
I can - come!

412
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:00,873
Run, Doctor - run!

413
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:02,889
Report!

414
00:29:03,257 --> 00:29:06,585
The security guards have combed the tunnels.
They've found nothing.

415
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:10,056
You have failed the Daleks! You will be punished!

416
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:14,224
The fault is not mine! Your security guards let them get away.

417
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:18,161
- Those creatures are useless!
- They are loyal to the Daleks.

418
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:22,232
As loyal as they are stupid!
They will never be a match for human guerillas.

419
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:26,083
No one can succeed who opposes the Daleks.

420
00:29:26,253 --> 00:29:29,183
For every guerilla cell that you destroy,
another one springs up.

421
00:29:29,293 --> 00:29:31,483
They have stolen your time machines and copied them.

422
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:33,683
They steal your weapons, your explosives.

423
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:38,459
These criminals will be exterminated.
The Daleks will destroy them.

424
00:29:38,615 --> 00:29:41,602
If only you would let me
recruit more human security guards...

425
00:29:41,826 --> 00:29:44,311
Humans are treacherous and unreliable!

426
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,592
Not all humans. I have served you faithfully.

427
00:29:48,771 --> 00:29:52,572
Do not dispute with the Daleks!
Obey without question!

428
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,702
Very well. There was one... curious thing.

429
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:04,902
The girl referred to a companion in her own time zone.
She called him... "the Doctor".

430
00:30:05,073 --> 00:30:07,418
Doctor?! Did you say "Doctor"?!

431
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:10,983
He appears to have got through to our time.
He was seen by the guards.

432
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:18,409
The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks!
He must be found at once and exterminated!

433
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:41,518
Don't gloss over it, Anat, we failed!

434
00:30:41,684 --> 00:30:44,115
We had no choice once our plan was known to them.

435
00:30:44,304 --> 00:30:46,532
If you'd listened to me, we still could have done what was needed.

436
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,534
We did all we could!

437
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:51,561
Monia, our orders were to eliminate Styles, right?

438
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:52,647
Yes, but you failed.

439
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:53,599
We could have succeeded.

440
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:54,582
Then why didn't you?

441
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,924
He wasn't there! Security guards found us.

442
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:58,422
But Anat went soft.

443
00:30:58,566 --> 00:30:59,303
Be quiet.

444
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:00,547
The trouble with you, Boaz is...

445
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:04,401
Both of you! We have to think now.
The situation is different.

446
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,980
As I see it, it's exactly the same -
we still have a job to do.

447
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:12,146
No. There may be other ways.
I've had a report from one of our contacts.

448
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:15,546
A girl has been captured.
They're holding her prisoner at the control centre.

449
00:31:15,714 --> 00:31:19,001
The same girl - the one who operated
the time module at Styles' house?

450
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:20,363
It fits your description.

451
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:22,230
Well, at least she's alive.

452
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:25,156
In the hands of the Daleks? She won't live long.

453
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:26,409
Can she tell them anything?

454
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:29,234
Nothing of importance.
Have they picked up that Doctor yet?

455
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:33,330
Not yet. It's only a matter of time.

456
00:31:33,537 --> 00:31:37,149
Move! Move! Come along there, you scum!

457
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:46,289
Move! Come along there, move! Move! Go on!

458
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:57,134
Well?

459
00:31:57,402 --> 00:32:01,022
Been captured. Taken for processing.
We must rescue him.

460
00:32:01,194 --> 00:32:03,352
Rescue him? Are you mad?! From there?

461
00:32:03,475 --> 00:32:05,239
I say we must!

462
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:07,069
Suicide.

463
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:09,196
Are you afraid?

464
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:15,203
Me? Of course I am. I'm not a fool.
What is he to us?

465
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:18,183
We have fresh information from
one of our contacts at control centre.

466
00:32:18,265 --> 00:32:22,483
He is the sworn enemy of the Daleks.
He is the one man they're afraid of - don't you see?

467
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:26,783
It's our only hope. If we don't act quickly,
it may be too late.

468
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:33,234
You are the Doctor! You are an enemy of the Daleks!

469
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:37,634
Now you are in our power! You will be exterminated!

470
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:45,232
You will be exterminated! You will be exterminated!
You will be exterminated! You will be exterminated!

471
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:51,887
Stop! You mustn't kill him!

472
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:54,800
<i>- Be silent.</i>
- Don't you realise he can help us?

473
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:58,357
<i>The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks.</i>

474
00:32:58,447 --> 00:33:00,244
<i>How can he help us?</i>

475
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:03,524
He is our contact with the guerrillas.
He has valuable information.

476
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,883
<i>- You have proof of this?</i>
- I know he's working for them.

477
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:11,677
<i>We will force the truth from him</i>
<i>with the mind analysis machine.</i>

478
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:13,246
But look at him!

479
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:16,603
You've practically killed him just
getting a simple admission of identity.

480
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:18,803
He'll die before
he tells you anything else.

481
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:20,798
<i>What is your plan?</i>

482
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:23,681
Let me interrogate him.

483
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,917
<i>Why should you be more successful?</i>

484
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:28,919
Because I understand human psychology.

485
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,759
I shall be able to gain his confidence.

486
00:33:30,847 --> 00:33:32,838
To put pressure on him through the girl.

487
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,282
By the time I have finished with him,

488
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:39,679
I shall be able to crush the guerrilla
organisation entirely!

489
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:41,126
<i>Release him.</i>

490
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:47,776
Now, the control centre is here.

491
00:33:47,947 --> 00:33:51,064
As far as we know, they're being held
prisoner in this block here.

492
00:33:51,187 --> 00:33:52,381
And how do we get through?

493
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:55,061
The disused underground railway of the old city.

494
00:33:55,147 --> 00:33:56,865
There's an exit right by this wall.

495
00:33:57,027 --> 00:33:59,416
I know the Doctor
would help you if he could.

496
00:33:59,507 --> 00:34:02,943
I am trying to help him!
I've already saved his life.

497
00:34:03,027 --> 00:34:04,176
Yes, for your own purposes.

498
00:34:04,267 --> 00:34:08,465
Look, if you do not tell me where they operate from,
what their plans are,

499
00:34:08,707 --> 00:34:12,063
then the Daleks will destroy both of you.

500
00:34:13,147 --> 00:34:14,785
I don't doubt it.

501
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:16,825
Do you value life so little?

502
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:18,977
On the contrary, I value it enormously.

503
00:34:20,507 --> 00:34:22,543
The Daleks will kill us whatever we tell you.

504
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,185
Not if you cooperate with them.

505
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:26,656
As you cooperate with them?

506
00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:28,624
Do you really think that makes any difference?

507
00:34:28,707 --> 00:34:31,904
- They can be reasonable!
- Reasonable?

508
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,182
They tolerate you as long as you're useful to them.

509
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:36,178
I am a senior government official.

510
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:39,100
You, sir, you, sir, are a traitor!

511
00:34:39,187 --> 00:34:40,224
You're a Quisling!

512
00:34:40,307 --> 00:34:42,218
You do not understand!

513
00:34:42,307 --> 00:34:44,867
We have helped make things better for the others.

514
00:34:44,987 --> 00:34:48,263
We have gained concessions. I have saved lives!

515
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:51,896
Wouldn't you have helped more
by organising the fight against them?

516
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:54,421
No one can fight against the Daleks.

517
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:57,704
That's not what your criminal guerrillas
seem to think, is it?

518
00:34:57,787 --> 00:35:00,062
A handful of fanatics?

519
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:02,900
Most of them have been killed already.

520
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:08,141
I assure you, there is nothing
they can do to change things.

521
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:24,184
<i>- Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>
- Anat, look out!

522
00:35:40,587 --> 00:35:42,657
Come! We must reach the control centre, come!

523
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,297
No! Come! Come!

524
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:53,239
For the last time, I tell you
I haven't got any information.

525
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:55,719
And quite frankly, even if I had,
I wouldn't give it to you!

526
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:57,286
- Right, stay where you are!
- Guards!

527
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:59,676
Guards? You have no guards. They're all dead.

528
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:01,359
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

529
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:03,961
- All the better for seeing you.
- You're coming with us.

530
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:06,277
No harm must come to these two.
Too much depends on them.

531
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:09,439
- As for you, my friend...
- Put that gun down!

532
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:11,686
There's no point in murdering him.

533
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:13,405
You don't know how much
blood there is on his hands.

534
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:15,125
Nevertheless, he's not your real enemy.

535
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:17,437
He's helped the Daleks. He's worked for them!

536
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:20,121
They would always have found someone.

537
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:21,196
Now, just leave him.

538
00:36:24,127 --> 00:36:25,719
Right, let's go.

539
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:42,762
- But how do you know this?
- Oh, there are books.

540
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:45,645
Even during the wars, people found time
to study, to write about it.

541
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:48,241
What to you has not yet happened
is to us history.

542
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:50,795
This history of yours,
it talks about Sir Reginald Styles?

543
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:53,037
Oh, yeah, he pretended to be working for peace,

544
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,879
but really he just wanted power for himself.

545
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:56,878
So the conference he called was just a trick?

546
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,481
He managed to lure the world leaders to
a remote country house

547
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:03,116
and he pretended they needed absolute
quiet if the meeting was to succeed.

548
00:37:03,207 --> 00:37:05,596
But then, there was a devastating explosion...

549
00:37:05,687 --> 00:37:07,757
And Styles was killed with the others.

550
00:37:07,847 --> 00:37:09,997
He must have set a bomb and mistimed the charge.

551
00:37:10,087 --> 00:37:12,362
There were accusations, counter-accusations,

552
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:15,359
and then the wars began. That was the turning point.

553
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:19,281
But if this true, Sir Reginald Styles
must be completely round the bend!

554
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:21,881
Er, so, you went back into our time

555
00:37:21,967 --> 00:37:24,242
to kill Styles before he could carry out his plan?

556
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:26,397
Right. We've been fighting the Daleks for years.

557
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:27,476
But it was hopeless.

558
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:30,639
Eventually we must lose, so we thought,
what else can we do?

559
00:37:30,727 --> 00:37:32,080
We learnt through one of our spies

560
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,000
that the Daleks had succeeded
in creating a time machine.

561
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:38,762
We even managed to steal a copy of
the plans, and we built one of our own,

562
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:41,725
so that we could go back into history
to the exact point

563
00:37:41,807 --> 00:37:43,206
where things started to go wrong.

564
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:45,005
With one action, we could stop them.

565
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:47,442
Mankind could have a chance
to take a new direction!

566
00:37:47,527 --> 00:37:49,757
But even now, the transfer isn't always stable.

567
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:53,078
People materialised in your time
and then just faded away.

568
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:54,236
The ghost that Styles saw?

569
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:57,160
Somehow, somehow the Daleks
found what we were doing.

570
00:37:57,247 --> 00:38:01,001
And they sent Ogrons back into your time
after us and attacked one of our men.

571
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:04,159
Well, that must have been the man
that we saw down by the canal tunnel.

572
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:06,363
You remember, Jo, the one who vanished
from the ambulance?

573
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:08,324
Yes, we fixed on the tunnel

574
00:38:08,407 --> 00:38:10,967
as a place that was stable in your time and in ours.

575
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:14,244
We used it as a transfer point.
Well, you know the rest.

576
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,595
Yes, well there's... There's one thing
I don't quite understand and that is

577
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:20,997
why were you so keen to rescue us?
And believe me, we're grateful, but...

578
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:23,681
Well, you told us yourself,
you're an old enemy of the Daleks.

579
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:26,156
- Yes?
- Then you will help us to beat them.

580
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:28,486
What do you expect me to do?

581
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:31,035
Well, you can succeed where we've failed, Doctor.

582
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:35,319
We want you to go back into your
own time and kill Styles.

583
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:38,999
You're asking me to commit murder!

584
00:38:39,087 --> 00:38:43,000
No! We're asking you to kill one man
and prevent millions more dying.

585
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,282
- That is still murder.
- Isn't it worth it?

586
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,756
- To save the human race from the Daleks?
- Yes, but would it?

587
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:49,678
We've told you how it happened.

588
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:52,486
But your history could be wrong, you know.

589
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:57,243
Now, listen, why don't you
send us back to our time?

590
00:38:57,327 --> 00:38:59,522
We know the future now,
maybe there are other things we can do?

591
00:38:59,607 --> 00:39:01,484
Monia, we're wasting valuable time!
Every minute that goes by...

592
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:04,127
Doctor, will you help us? It's our only hope.

593
00:39:04,207 --> 00:39:07,961
I still can't believe that Sir Reginald
Styles is a ruthless murderer.

594
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:09,639
Yes, I agree, Jo.

595
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:11,877
Vain to the point of arrogance,
a trifle obstinate, perhaps,

596
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:14,276
but basically a good man.

597
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:19,485
So, if it happened, how did it happen?

598
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:24,837
Any of your people
still in our time zone?

599
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:27,441
- No.
- Well, Shura.

600
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:30,599
He left just to send a message and we
never saw nor heard from him again.

601
00:39:30,687 --> 00:39:32,006
We assumed he must be dead.

602
00:39:53,747 --> 00:39:56,839
Look, please believe me,
I'm completely with you about the ends.

603
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,681
I only disagree as to the means.

604
00:39:59,487 --> 00:40:02,001
All right. What do you want to know?

605
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:07,123
This mission of yours to the 20th
century, what did you take with you?

606
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:09,676
The usual battle gear, radio, disintegrators...

607
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:13,362
- Any sabotage equipment?
- Only a few charges of Dalekenium.

608
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:15,326
Dalekenium?

609
00:40:15,407 --> 00:40:17,637
It's a highly effective type of explosive.

610
00:40:17,727 --> 00:40:20,366
We stole the formula from the Daleks.

611
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:23,524
- Could it destroy a house?
- What are you trying to say, Doctor?

612
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,117
Well, don't you see? This has happened before!

613
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:28,640
What has?

614
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:31,756
You went back to change history,

615
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:33,997
but you didn't change anything,
you became a part of it.

616
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:35,998
What are you talking about?

617
00:40:36,087 --> 00:40:39,477
If Styles didn't cause that explosion,
somebody else did.

618
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:41,364
Well, obviously, but who...

619
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:43,602
Shura!

620
00:40:43,687 --> 00:40:46,440
Isn't that exactly what he would have done?

621
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,360
One last suicidal attempt to carry out his orders?

622
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,436
It's possible, I suppose.

623
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:53,121
You're trapped in a temporal paradox!

624
00:40:53,727 --> 00:40:56,366
Styles didn't cause that explosion
and start the wars,

625
00:40:57,527 --> 00:40:59,085
you did it yourselves!

626
00:40:59,967 --> 00:41:03,721
<i>You have failed the Daleks.</i>
<i>The Doctor has escaped.</i>

627
00:41:03,847 --> 00:41:06,042
He will be recaptured. I swear it!

628
00:41:06,127 --> 00:41:08,925
<i>He must be found and destroyed.</i>

629
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:11,441
He will attempt to return to his own time zone.

630
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:14,644
If those guerrillas are helping
him, they will use the tunnel

631
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:16,480
and I am setting up an ambush.

632
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:20,401
<i>If you fail us again,</i>
<i>you will pay with your life.</i>

633
00:41:20,487 --> 00:41:22,637
<i>This is your final chance.</i>

634
00:41:24,087 --> 00:41:26,647
I will go and supervise the operations myself.

635
00:41:35,007 --> 00:41:36,963
Is everything ready?

636
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:40,404
Security forces have covered the whole tunnel.

637
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:43,845
Don't worry, they won't escape a second time.

638
00:42:13,727 --> 00:42:16,195
So it has ended as I said it would.

639
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,120
Did I not tell you it was madness
to fight the Daleks?

640
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:22,563
Is it madness to want to see a world
free from their rule?

641
00:42:22,647 --> 00:42:24,478
- It can't be done.
- Oh, yes it can.

642
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:28,364
And I can do it. Are you going to stop me?

643
00:42:33,807 --> 00:42:37,595
Go. I will deal with these criminals myself.

644
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,921
I said go!

645
00:42:48,687 --> 00:42:50,518
If only I could be sure.

646
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:52,757
You spoke of the war,

647
00:42:52,847 --> 00:42:55,281
of its years of suffering and starvation.

648
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:59,804
Well, I can prevent all that happening, you know.

649
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:05,279
You saved my life. You could have let them kill me.

650
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:10,597
- Go, quickly.
- Thank you.

651
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:16,237
Jo, come here and stand by me.

652
00:43:40,647 --> 00:43:42,558
Sergeant! They're here!

653
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,364
This is Sergeant Benton calling UNIT HQ.

654
00:43:45,447 --> 00:43:48,120
Look, we've found them.
Will you get a Jeep over here pronto?

655
00:43:48,207 --> 00:43:49,322
This way, Doctor.

656
00:43:51,207 --> 00:43:53,641
I am sorry. They were too quick for us.

657
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,046
They escaped in the darkness.

658
00:43:55,127 --> 00:43:58,961
<i>You are lying You have betrayed the Daleks.</i>

659
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:01,880
No! I told you before,

660
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:04,527
those security guards
are no match for humans.

661
00:44:04,607 --> 00:44:07,201
<i>You are a traitor to the Daleks.</i>

662
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:09,721
<i>You must be exterminated!</i>

663
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:14,119
Who knows? I may have helped to exterminate you!

664
00:44:22,247 --> 00:44:26,559
<i>You have proved yourself worthy</i>
<i>to be the new Controller,</i>

665
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:33,082
<i>but be warned, the Daleks demand total loyalty</i>
<i>from those who serve them.</i>

666
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:34,486
Of course.

667
00:44:39,127 --> 00:44:42,915
<i>We must follow them into</i>
<i>the 20th century time zone.</i>

668
00:44:43,007 --> 00:44:45,601
<i>The peace conference must be destroyed.</i>

669
00:44:45,687 --> 00:44:47,245
<i>War must break out.</i>

670
00:44:47,327 --> 00:44:51,764
<i>The Dalek conquest of the planet Earth</i>
<i>must not be reversed!</i>

671
00:45:07,127 --> 00:45:08,958
Look, you're supposed to be in charge of security.

672
00:45:09,047 --> 00:45:11,845
Kindly get on with your job
and leave me to get on with mine.

673
00:45:11,927 --> 00:45:14,919
Brigadier! Brigadier,
get everybody out of this house at once!

674
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:16,156
Where the devil have you been?

675
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:17,885
Never mind all that.
Just clear this house immediately!

676
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:19,161
What's the man talking about?

677
00:45:19,247 --> 00:45:21,477
Do as he says! Look, there isn't much time!

678
00:45:27,047 --> 00:45:30,722
<i>Locate and destroy the peace conference.</i>

679
00:45:35,127 --> 00:45:36,879
<i>Exterminate!</i>

680
00:45:46,127 --> 00:45:48,402
<i>Destroy the human resistance!</i>

681
00:45:57,527 --> 00:45:59,677
<i>Eliminate all humans!</i>

682
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:01,116
<i>Exterminate!</i>

683
00:46:03,447 --> 00:46:04,960
<i>Exterminate!</i>

684
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:08,084
Brigadier, get this man and all the
delegates out of this area immediately.

685
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:11,239
Use force if you have to!
Jo, you stay here.

686
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:14,201
- Sir Reginald, please?
- No, I will not permit it!

687
00:46:15,327 --> 00:46:16,396
Shura!

688
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:18,205
Get out of here unless you want to die too!

689
00:46:18,287 --> 00:46:20,039
I must kill Styles to prevent the war!

690
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:21,446
Shura, listen to me.

691
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:24,758
Styles and all the delegates
are already leaving this house.

692
00:46:24,847 --> 00:46:27,441
You detonate that bomb and you'll be
sacrificing yourself for nothing.

693
00:46:28,127 --> 00:46:31,119
Benton calling UNIT HQ,
Benton calling UNIT HQ,

694
00:46:31,207 --> 00:46:32,356
we just can't hold them, sir!

695
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,324
Look, Benton, keep them back
as long as you can.

696
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:36,682
Sir Reginald, this house is under attack
by a hostile force.

697
00:46:36,767 --> 00:46:38,758
You will please consider yourself
under my orders.

698
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,485
- Brigadier, I warn you...
- Now be quiet, sir!

699
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:41,556
- Captain Yates?
- Sir.

700
00:46:41,647 --> 00:46:44,121
Get Sir Reginald and all the delegates
away from this area at once. 

701
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,640
Locate and destroy the peace conference!

702
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:29,881
Doctor! The Daleks, they're coming into the house!

703
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:32,481
- Daleks? You're lying!
- No, she's not.

704
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:35,639
They've come back to make sure that
their version of history isn't changed.

705
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:37,997
- Is everybody out of the house?
- Yes, everyone but us.

706
00:47:38,247 --> 00:47:40,920
Get out of here. Let them come in!
Leave them to me!

707
00:47:41,007 --> 00:47:43,475
- No, no! You must come with us!
- You don't understand!

708
00:47:43,567 --> 00:47:46,559
That's Dalekenium. It's the only thing
that's effective against the Daleks.

709
00:47:46,647 --> 00:47:48,080
Well, couldn't we set a time fuse?

710
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:50,920
No, this stuff's too unstable.
There just isn't time.

711
00:47:51,007 --> 00:47:53,805
This is something that I must do myself.
Now, get out!

712
00:47:54,527 --> 00:47:57,200
- Very well.
- Out!

713
00:48:00,647 --> 00:48:02,205
Greyhound to Trap One,
Greyhound to Trap One,

714
00:48:02,287 --> 00:48:04,243
do you read me? Over. Greyhound to...

715
00:48:04,327 --> 00:48:07,444
Tell your men to fall back.
Let the Daleks into the house.

716
00:48:07,527 --> 00:48:08,562
Doctor, are you sure that...

717
00:48:08,647 --> 00:48:11,002
It may not make military sense
but it's the only way.

718
00:48:11,087 --> 00:48:13,806
All right. Brigadier to all units.

719
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:17,004
Let them pass! I say again, let them pass!

720
00:48:17,487 --> 00:48:19,398
Re-group on the main road, out!

721
00:48:21,847 --> 00:48:23,644
<i>Exterminate!</i>

722
00:48:24,887 --> 00:48:28,243
<i>Eliminate all humans. Exterminate!</i>

723
00:48:28,767 --> 00:48:31,725
<i>The human delegates are inside the house.</i>

724
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:33,399
<i>Enter and destroy.</i>

725
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:39,685
<i>- Where are the delegates?</i>
<i>- Where is the man Styles?</i>

726
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:43,282
<i>They must be found and exterminated!</i>

727
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:46,120
Oh, no, not this time.

728
00:48:46,207 --> 00:48:47,765
This time it's going to be different!

729
00:48:55,007 --> 00:48:56,440
Well, what happened?

730
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:03,479
Your conference has been saved, Sir Reginald.

731
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:07,477
Now it's up to you and your friends
to make sure it's a success.

732
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:09,558
- You still have a choice.
- Don't worry.

733
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,517
We all know what will happen if we fail.

734
00:49:12,607 --> 00:49:16,282
So do we. We've seen it happen, haven't we, Jo?

735
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:19,835
