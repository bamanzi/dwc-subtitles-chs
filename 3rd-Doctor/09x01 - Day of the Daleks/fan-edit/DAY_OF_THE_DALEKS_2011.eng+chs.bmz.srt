Doctor, why don't you take a break?
博士，你为什么不休息一下？

6
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,615
It's maddening, you know. So nearly there.
很让人抓狂啊，知道吧。很接近了啊

If I could only cut out their override
on the dematerialisation circuit.

What gave you that idea?

00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:39,175
Oh, being dragged off to an alien planet
five hundred years in the future, for example.
哦，比如说，我被拖到了五百年后的一颗外星

00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:41,575
Oh, you know - all that business
with the miners and the colonists.
你知道的，都是矿工啊殖民者啊那些事

My dear Jo, the TARDIS was being operated then 
under remote control by the High Council of the Time Lords.
亲爱的 Jo, TARDIS 那时候是被时间领主最高议会远程控制着呢

Well, if it worked for them...
如果对他们来说这可以用...

16
00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:50,789
I don't want it to work for them.
I want it to work for me.
我不想它对他们可以用，我想要它对我可以用

17
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:53,889
No-one's going to turn me into
an interplanetary puppet.
任何人别想把我变成一个星际傀儡

18
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,857
Yes, of course. Why didn't I think of that before?

Yes, of course. I remember now.
是的，当然，我想起来了

Look, don't worry, my dear. 
I know you're alarmed but you needn't be.
看，别担心，亲爱的。我知道你受惊了，但没有必要

Yes, well I think that should do it. 
Why on Earth I never realised that...

Oh no! What are you doing here?

Well, I'm not here. Don't worry.
其实，我没在这里。别担心

Er... yes, well, it's a bit difficult
to explain really.
呃...这个，的确有点难解释

00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:37,279
This won't do at all!
We can't have two of us running about.

Yes, well don't worry. It will all sor...

Well, it's a very complicated thing - time - Jo.
这个, 它是一件很复杂的事情 - 时间 - Jo

the oddest things start happening.

But there was another you and another... me.

Well, where've they gone?

00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:59,620
Back into their own time stream, of course.
Or do I mean forward?

34
00:02:59,631 --> 00:03:01,250
But, Doctor, I don't understand...
但是，博士，我搞不明白...

35
00:03:01,262 --> 00:03:05,233
Look, Jo. Don't worry about it. It was a freak affect. 
It's very unlikely to happen again.
听着, Jo, 别担心。这是一个奇怪的现象，非常不可能再次发生

36
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:06,967
Hold that and give me those papers.

No, can't say that I have.

Well isn't he the chief representative at the UN?

That's right - key figure at the latest
summit conference.

...tinkering around with this wretched contraption,

48
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,989
you'd realise just how bad
the international situation's become.

49
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:40,166
Humans are always squabbling over something, Brigadier.
人类总是会为点什么事争论不休, 准将

ending up in a third world war.
是的, 好吧, 这一次的争吵看起来像是要导致第三次世界大战似的

Without them, the conference can't even begin.

Now Styles is flying to Peking in a few hours./?
现在 Styles 几个小时后就要飞往北京

There's just a chance that he can
persuade them to change their minds.
他也许有机会说服他们改变主意

54
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:56,126
All right, Brigadier. So what's his problem?
好吧, 准将。那他那里有什么问题？

Well, he was working late last night,
down at Auderly...

Where's that?

Auderly, Miss Grant, is a Government owned
country house about fifty miles north of London/?
Auderly 是政府拥有的一栋乡村房子，在伦敦北面大约50英里

He suddenly started behaving... rather oddly./?

He said somebody attacked him and vanished.

he used the word "ghost"?

65
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,483
Oh yes. But afterwards he...

66
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:35,988
Miss Paget! What's going on here?!

67
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:37,992

some sort of incident, Sir Reginald?

72
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:46,319
Nothing of any importance.

73
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:48,368
Well, if you could tell us what happened?

I was working late. I must have dropped off.

Freak gust of wind, blew some papers off my desk,

- 这个时候 Paget 小姐进来的  - 但你的确之前提到过“鬼魂”

Did I? Must have been having a nightmare.
有吗？我肯定是做了噩梦了

But the French windows weren't shut.
I closed them before I went to bed.
但落地窗没有关闭。我在上床之前是关了的

80
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:07,394
Then I must have opened them!

81
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:13,092
Did you, er, did you also make
those marks on the floor over there?

Are you accusing me of lying, sir?!

Sir Reginald, you've obviously been 
under considerable strain recently.

Sergeant!

- Yates 队长...  - 马上, 先生

This is a new one on me.
What do you make of it, Doctor?

It was hidden about fifty feet inside the tunnel.

Have you seen this before?

00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:22,586
Really Brigadier!
What sort of games are you playing?
真的吗, 准将！你到底在玩什么游戏？

101
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,967
It's not a game, sir. 
It's our duty to protect you!

I don't need your protection!

Sir Reginald, we've just found a very severely
injured man down by the canal tunnel.

Oh really? And what did he look like?
哦真的吗？他什么样子？

105

Thirty-fiveish, average build. He was wearing
a sort of guerilla combat suit.
大约25岁, 中等身材, 穿着一种迷彩作战服

106

- And carrying that gun.
- I am very sorry, gentlemen,
- 还带着枪  - 我很抱歉, 先生们

107
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:44,396
but I have rather more important things
on my mind at the moment.
但我这会儿想起还有更加重要的事情

108
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:47,247
- If you'll excuse me?
- I've arranged an escort to take you to the airport, sir.
- 抱歉呢  - 我安排几个人护送你到机场去, 爵士

Thank you, but it shouldn't be necessary.

00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:50,300
I'm sorry, sir, but I think it will!
抱歉, 爵士, 但我觉得有必要

111
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:51,631
Oh, if you insist.
哦, 你非得坚持

112
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,512
I'd like to get that gun down to the laboratory
and run a few tests on it.
我得把那把枪拿到实验室去做几个测试

113
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:05,162
Well, basically it's a form of ultra-sonic disintegrator.
好了, 基本上来说它是一种超声裂解枪

114
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,361
You mean a ray gun?
你是说射线枪？

115
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:08,514
That's right, Jo, I mean a ray gun.
说对了, Jo, 我的意思是射线枪

116
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:13,214
Only it's far more sophisticated than any weapon
yet invented on Earth. Now take a look at this.
只不过它比地球上说造的任何武器都复杂, 现在看着

117
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:19,825
Quite an effective little weapon, eh?
非常厉害的小武器, 是哈？

118
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:25,472
Doctor, you say this wasn't made on Earth.
Do you mean it comes from another planet?
博士, 你说它不是在地球上造的, 那就是说它来自其它星球？

119
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,479
Well that was my theory at first, yes.
这也是我一开始的想法, 是

120
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,979
But the metallurgical analysis shows that the,
er, iron constituent is very much of this world.
但是材料分析却表明, 它的钢铁成分是属于这个世界的

121
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,779
In fact, it was mined not very far from here
- North Wales.
事实上, 就来自离这里不远的地方 - 北威尔士

122
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:37,761
How do you explain that?
那你怎么解释？

123
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:42,080
Do you believe in ghosts, Brigadier?
你相信鬼魂吗, 准将？

124
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,247
Let's be serious, Doctor.
我们说正经的了, 博士

125
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:44,152
I am.
我很正经

126
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:45,792
Oh, come along, Doctor, come along.
哦, 得了, 博士, 拉倒吧

127
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:50,714
Oh, my mistake. I was forgetting
the unimaginative nature of the military mind.
哦, 我错了, 我忘记了一个军人的大脑是没有想象力的

128
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:54,214
But we saw a couple of "Amicus Seperatus"
a few moments ago, didn't we, Jo?
当我们在不久之前见到 Amicus Seperatus 现象了, 对不, Jo?

129
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:55,202
Did we?
有吗？

130
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:56,725
Yes, here in this laboratory.
是的, 就在这实验室

131
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:57,985
Oh, you mean when we...
哦, 你是说我们那时...

132
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,697
Mind you, they were manifestations
of a much more benevolent kind.
fixme

133
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,197
None of your clanking chains and chilly fingers!
But ghosts, none the less.

134
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:09,942
That was because you were playing around
with the time mechanism on the TARDIS, wasn't it?
那是因为你当时在折腾 TARDIS 的时间机制, 是吧？

135
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:11,934
Still can't get it to work, eh?
还是没法让它工作啊, 嗯？

136
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:13,918
Well, I can't get this thing to work, either.
是啊, 我也不能让它工作

137
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:18,588
But this is a form of, er, of time machine
of a very crude kind.
但这是一个, 呃, 时间机器, 比较粗糙的那种

138
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:19,935
How do you know?
你怎么知道？

139
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:21,305
Come over here. Look at this.
到这里来, 看看这个

140
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:24,158
Now what do you think that is?
你觉得这是什么？

141
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,885
Ooh, it's a... mini-dematerialisation circuit.
哦, 这是个...迷你型的反物质化电路

142
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:29,853
Top of the class, Jo.
Now then, pop this in here, like that.
优等生, Jo。既然如此, 把这个塞到这里, 这样

143
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,150
Now, as far as I can gather,
when you push this button, it should...
现在, 据我的推断, 一旦你按下这个按钮, 它就可以...

144
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:36,637
Good grief! It's working!
老天爷, 它可以工作了！

145
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:46,898
Sir?
头儿？

146
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:48,255
What is it?
什么事？

147
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:51,292
Time transmitter in operation, sir.
Twentieth Century Zone.
时间发射器在运转了, 头儿, 在20世纪区域

148
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:53,565
Can you fix the space-time coordinates?
你能锁定时空坐标吗？

149
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,053
Do be careful, Doctor!
小心点, 博士！

150
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,882
All right, Jo, all right.
没事的, Jo, 没事

151
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,305
- Well?  - No good, sir.
- 怎样  - 不行, 头儿

152
00:08:58,427 --> 00:09:02,208
There was a transference, I think, 
but the machine's cut out completely.
刚才有干扰, 我觉得, 然后机器就完全切断了

153
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:07,234
Continue scanning - and next time
you had better be more efficient!
继续扫描 - 下次你最好效率高点

154
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,417
Report!
报告！

155
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:16,695
Yes, I see. All right, sergeant.
You'd better report back to Captain Yates. Goodbye.
是的, 我明白, 没事, 中士。你最好报告给 Yates 队长, 再见

156
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:19,807
That was Benton. He was in the ambulance
with the man we found.
 Benton, 他刚才跟我们找到的那个人一起在救护车上

157
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:20,920
Well?
怎么了？

158
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:26,999
Well according to him, that man just...
vanished, faded away
据他所说, 那个人刚刚...消失了, 慢慢淡出了

159
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:29,246
- like a ghost.  - Oh no!
- 像鬼一样  - 噢, 不！

160
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:30,904
Well, Doctor, what now?
那, 博士, 现在怎么办？

161
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:34,166
Well, everything that happens seems to
centre round Styles' house.
嗯, 发生的所有这些事似乎都是跟 Style 的房子有关的

162
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:35,532
Obviously.
这显然

163
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:37,604
And whoever tried to harm him
will probably try again.
那些试图伤害他的人, 很可能还会再次下手

164
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:43,940
Jo, how would you like to spend the night
in a haunted house?
Jo, 你觉得到闹鬼的房子里过一晚怎么样？

165
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:08,846
Wake up, Jo.
醒醒, Jo

166
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:10,678
It's all right. It's morning.
没什么事, 天亮了

167
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,052
Nothing's happened?
什么都没发生？

168
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:13,175
No, nothing at all.
没有, 完全没有

169
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:50,901
Jo! Jo!
Jo! Jo!

170
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:34,224
Please! Turn that machine off
- or they'll kill all of us! Please!
拜托, 把那个机器关掉 - 不然他们会把我们都杀死！求你了

171
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:40,237
Sir?
头儿？

172
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:41,219
Yes?
怎么？

173
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:43,492
We've picked up that time transmitter again.
我们又识别到那个时间发射器了

174
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:44,377
You're sure?
你确定吗？

175
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:48,166
Yes, sir. Same frequency, same time...
time zone. Much stronger now.
是的, 头儿。同样的频率同样的时间..时区。现在信号强多了

176
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,427
Right. I want the exact space-time co-ordinates,
so whatever happens, don't lose it!
好, 我要确切的时空坐标, 所有不管发生什么, 不要跟丢了

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,300
What is your report?
你要报告什么？

178
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,436
We have a fix on the time transfer device.
我们已经锁定了那个时间传送装置

179
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:07,436
It is operating again in the twentieth century
time zone and it must be them.
它在20世纪区域再次开启, 肯定是他们

180
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:13,131
You have obtained the space-time co-ordinates?
你已经得到了时空坐标？

181
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:16,819
We're trying now. The trace is
much stronger this time.
我们正在尝试, 这次信号比较强

182
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:19,626
- There is every chance...
- You must not fail!
- 这次肯定有机会...  - 你必须成功！

183
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,278
Security forces are standing by.
安全部队已经在待命了

184
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,778
If we do get the co-ordinates, 
what are your instructions?
如果我们拿到坐标, 你们有什么指示？

185
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:36,737
Whoever is operating the time machine
is an enemy of the Daleks.
不管是谁在操作那个时间机器, 他都是 Daleks 的敌人

186
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:42,937
All enemies of the Daleks must be destroyed!
Exterminate them!
而 Daleks 的所有敌人都必须消灭！终结他们！

187
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:44,839
Let him go.
让我走

188
00:12:45,913 --> 00:12:48,236
Now then - turn off that machine.
既然如此, 关掉机器

189
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:07,178
I have to report that we have lost the trace.
It was operating only a few moments.
我不得不说我们跟丢了, 它仅仅只开启了一小会儿

190
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:13,993
We are not interested in excuses.
Find them! Find them! Find them!
我们对接口不感兴趣！找到他们, 找到他们, 找到他们！

191
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:16,848
No last words of repentance, Sir Reginald?
死到临头了你忏悔不, Reginald 爵士？

192
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:20,950
No, only that you're making one fundamental mistake...
不, 你犯了一个很基础的错误...

193
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:22,050
That is?
是什么?

194
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,555
A question of mistaken identity.
I am not Sir Reginald Styles.
你认错人了, 我不是 Reginald Styles 爵士

195
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,749
Is that the best you can do?
你最多也就只能这样？

196
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:31,685
But it's true! Sir Reginald...
但这是事实！Reginald 爵士他...

197
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:34,495
Sir Reginald is at this moment
many thousands of miles away -
Reginald 爵士这会儿正在千里之外

198
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:37,695
in Peking, to be precise.
确切地说, 在北京

199
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:39,383
You are lying.
你在撒谎

200
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:42,697
No, I'm not. He flew there yesterday.
不, 我没有。他昨天就飞过去了

201
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,012
I do not believe you.
我不相信你

202
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,747
It's all there in the paper in front of you.
Why don't you take a look?
这全都在你面前的报纸上, 你为什么不看一眼？

203
00:13:54,508 --> 00:13:56,466
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
很抱歉让你失望了

204
00:13:56,638 --> 00:13:58,112
It's a trick - kill him now!
这是个伎俩 - 现在就杀了他！

205
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:00,295
If you are not Sir Reginald Styles
如果你不是 Reginald Styles

206
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:03,295
who are you and what are you doing in his house?
那你是谁, 你在他的房子里做什么？

207
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:05,772
Well, believe it or believe it not,
I came here to see you.
嗯, 不知道你们信不信, 我是来见你们的

208
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,463
We're wasting time, Anat. Here, I'll do it.
我们这是在浪费时间, Anat。来, 我来下手

209
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:09,928
Who is in command of this mission?!
这次任务谁是指挥官？！

210
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:16,437
We are soldiers, not murderers.
Keep guard outside, I'll deal with these two.
我们是战士, 不是杀人犯。出去警戒, 我来对付这两个

211
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:18,474
I said out!
我说了出去

212
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:34,100
Now then, answer my question -
who are you and what are you doing here?
接下里, 回答我的问题 - 你是谁, 在这里做什么？

213
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,224
- I wanted to talk to you.  - Why?
- 我想来跟你们谈谈  - 为什么？

214
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,178
To find out where you came from.
And more to the point - when.
为了搞明白你们从哪里来, 更重要的是, 从何时来

215
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,299
- Two soldiers approach.  - Hide!
- 有两个士兵过来了  - 躲起来！

216
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:46,828
Down there!
下去!

217
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:48,170
Hurry!
快！

218
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,549
Captain Yates, sir, on four.
是 Yates 队长, 头儿, 四号线

219
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:55,173
I can't speak to him now.
我现在没法跟他通话

220
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:56,457
He says something very odd
is happening at Auderly House./56.4
他说 Auderly House 那边出了非常奇怪的事情

221
00:14:56,557 --> 00:14:59,457
If you could have a quick word with him, sir?
你能更他简单说几句吗, 头儿？

222
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,613
All right.
好吧

223
00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:01,791
Yes, what is it, Yates?
是我, 什么事, Yates？

224
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:05,030
A couple of my men missing, sir, 
and the Doctor and Miss Grant -
有几个我的人不见了, 头儿, 还有博士和Grant小姐

225
00:15:05,118 --> 00:15:06,850
- not a sign of them
- Look really, Yates,
- 他们一点踪迹没有  - 听着, 真的, Yate

226
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:09,950
I've got a major international crisis on.
I really haven't got time for any...
我这里有一个严重的国际危机, 我真的没时间来...

227
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,413
- Oh, Lethbridge-Stewart?
- Erm, yes, yes, that's right
- 哦, Lethbridge-Stewart?  - 呃, 是的是的，我就是

228
00:15:12,571 --> 00:15:14,563
- Yes, it's the Minister here.
- One moment, sir.
- 是的, 部长在这里  - 稍等, 先生

229
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:18,512
Listen, Yates, search the grounds again
or report back to me - out!
听着 Yates, 再次搜一下地面, 回报结果给我 - 挂了！

230
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:21,354
Yes, Minister?
好了, 部长

231
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:25,513
Right, they're clear of the house. Have you finished?
好了, 他们撤离这栋房子了。你完成了吗？

232
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,858
- Yes.  - We must go.
- 是的  - 我们得走了

233
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,111
Quietly!
安静！

234
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,132
Oh, that's better.
噢, 好多了

235
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:51,549
You know, I've got a good mind
to let you stay like that!
你知道吧, 我最好让你保持那样！

236
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:53,000
So much more peaceful.
安静多了

237
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:58,422
In any case, even if I released you,
you'll probably ask me a lot of fool questions!
不管怎样, 如果我放开你, 你就很可能问我很多傻问题！

238
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:02,426
I've only got one question - who are they?
我就只有一个问题  - 他们是谁？

239
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:04,821
On the face of it, three rather desperate people.
一方面看, 是三个挺绝望的人

240
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,487
Well, they're criminals - they must be!
当然, 他们是罪犯 - 他们肯定是

241
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:07,599
Ah, you're prejudiced.
啊, 你这是偏见

242
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:10,398
Well, aren't you? They tried to kill you and me.
那你不是？他们试图杀了你和我

243
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,887
That's not in their favour, I'll admit.
那对他们也没什么好处, 我得承认

244
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:15,987
You know, we shouldn't really judge 'em
until we find out why they're here.
在我们搞明白他们为什么到这里来之前, 我们不能乱下断言

245
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:18,219
We are maintaining constant watch,
我们在持续监视

246
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:21,819
but there is no sign of any
time transference module in operation.
但没有发现时间传送模块运转的迹象

247
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:25,791
All criminal elements must be
tracked down and destroyed.
所有的犯罪行为必须要追踪到, 要消灭

248
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,329
Well, I am doing everything possible, but...
是的, 我正在尽一切可能, 但是...

249
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:33,573
They will have returned to the time zone
where the first criminal was eliminated.
他们将会返回原时区, 也就是第一个罪犯被消灭的地方

250
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:38,373
You will dispatch security forces to search for them.
你得派遣安全部队去搜寻

251
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:40,795
Of course... at once.
当然... 马上执行

252
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:42,943
And the new equipment?
那新设备呢？

253
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,577
The Time Vortex Magnetron is set to the frequency
of the module that was traced.
时间涡流磁控管的频率, 已经调到与被追踪的模块一致了

254
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:56,077
Anyone using that module will be diverted
in the space-time vortex and attracted here.
任何人使用那个模块, 都会被时空涡流转移到这里来

255
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:58,484
But only if that particular module is used?
但只有使用那个特定的模块才会这样吧？

256
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:01,093
It is necessary to know the frequency.
知道频率是很有必要的

257
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:03,836
But surely no one will use the module?
They must realise that we can trace them...
但肯定没人将会使用这个模块？他们肯定意识到我们可以...

258
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:10,480
Do not dispute with the Daleks!
The function of the human is to obey!
不要跟 Dalek 争辩！人类的功能就是服从！

259
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,680
Activate the Magnetron!
激活磁控管！

260
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:26,257
...to base. Intercept to base. Do you coordinate?/?
..呼叫基地, 拦截小组呼叫基地, 你们能定位吗？

261
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:29,857
Do you coordinate? Intercept...
你们能定位吗？拦截小组...

262
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:33,622
No good. There is a massive disturbance in the vortex.
没效果。涡流里面干扰太强了

263
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:36,497
We cannot fail again. This is our last chance.
我们不能再失败了, 这是我们最后的机会

264
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:39,267
We must get fresh orders.
The time coordinates are crucial.
我们必须获得最新的命令, 时间坐标非常关键

265
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:41,032
We cannot wait for new orders!
我们等不起新命令了！

266
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,400
Look, why don't I return to the tunnel?
There's better chance of contact there.
听着, 我为什么不回到隧道去？在那里联系的话机会大些

267
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:45,849

00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,646
Yes, well, I'll explain about him later.
Excuse me, old chap, I'm in a hurry.
是的, 好吧, 我以后再解释他的事。对不起, 老伙计, 我赶时间

405
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:53,563
Get back! Get back!
回去！回去！

406
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:54,907
Please! Wait! I've got to talk to you!
拜托，等等！我要跟你们谈谈！

407
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:55,934
Keep away!
走开！

408
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,923
Exterminate!
终结！

409
00:26:58,309 --> 00:26:59,754
_ or you'll be caught in the time field!

410
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:20,095
We warned you.
我们警告过你

411
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:22,508
Yes, yes, so you did.
是的，是的，是这样

412
00:27:22,677 --> 00:27:26,514
This may come as a shock to you, but you've just
travelled two hundred years through time.
有一点可能会让你感到震惊, 但你刚刚穿越了两百年的时间

413
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:32,471
Thank you. But I'm probably more familiar
with the concept of time travel than you are.
谢谢。但我可能比你更熟悉时间旅行的概念

414
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:36,447
Now wait a minute. 
Before the time transference, I saw a Dalek.
现在等一下，在时间转移之前, 我看到了一个 Dalek

415
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,958
- You know of the Daleks?  - Indeed I do.
- 你知道 Dalek ？ - 我确实知道

416
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:42,296
I know them only too well. 
They've been my bitterest enemy for many years.
我太了解他们了。他们多年来一直是我最痛苦的敌人

417
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:44,193
Then you're a fool to have
let yourself be brought here!
那你让自己被带到这里来，就太傻了

418
00:27:44,338 --> 00:27:46,617
Look, I came here in order to find Miss Jo Grant.
听着，我来这里是为了找到 Jo Geant 小姐

419
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:48,607
I told you, she's probably dead.
我告诉过你, 她可能已经死了

420
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:49,955
But as long as there's a chance...
但只要还有一线可能...

421
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:51,048
Come on, Anat.
快点，Anat

422
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,968
Wait a minute - what is my best way of finding her?
等一下 - 我找到她的最好方法是什么？

423
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:54,015
That's your problem.
那是你的问题

424
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:55,223
We can't just leave him!
我们不能抛下他！

425
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,305
I can - come!
我能 - 走！

426
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:00,873
Run, Doctor - run!
跑，博士 - 快跑！

427
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:02,889
Report!
汇报！

428
00:29:03,257 --> 00:29:06,585
The security guards have combed the tunnels.
They've found nothing.
保安已经对隧道进行了排查。他们什么也没发现

429
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:10,056
You have failed the Daleks!
You will be punished!
你辜负了 Dalek! 你将会受到惩罚!

430
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:14,224
The fault is not mine!
Your security guards let them get away.
错不是我的! 你们的警卫让他们跑了

431
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:18,161
- Those creatures are useless!
- They are loyal to the Daleks.
- 那些生物一点用没有!  - 他们对 Dalek 很忠诚

432
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:22,232
As loyal as they are stupid!
They will never be a match for human guerillas.
同样也很愚蠢! 他们永远不会是人类游击队的对手

433
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:26,083
No one can succeed who opposes the Daleks.
跟 Dalek 作对的人没一个成功

434
00:29:26,253 --> 00:29:29,183
For every guerilla cell that you destroy,
another one springs up.
你每消灭一个游击队成员, 另一个又站起来了

435
00:29:29,293 --> 00:29:31,483
They have stolen your time machines
and copied them.
他们偷了你们的时间机器, 还复制了它们

436
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:33,683
They steal your weapons, your explosives.
他们偷了你们的武器，你们的炸药

437
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:38,459
These criminals will be exterminated.
The Daleks will destroy them.
这些罪犯将会被终结。Dalek 将摧毁他们

438
00:29:38,615 --> 00:29:41,602
If only you would let me recruit 
more human security guards...
要是你们能让我招募更多的人类保安就好了...

439
00:29:41,826 --> 00:29:44,311
Humans are treacherous and unreliable!
人类都很狡猾，不可靠!

440
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,592
Not all humans. I have served you faithfully.
并非所有人这样，我就一直忠实地为你们服务

441
00:29:48,771 --> 00:29:52,572
Do not dispute with the Daleks!
Obey without question!
不要与 Dalek 争辩! 毫无疑问地服从!

442
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,702
Very well. There was one... curious thing.
好吧。有一件...奇特的事情

443
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,502
The girl referred to a companion in her own time zone.
那个女孩提到她那个时区的一个同伴

444
00:30:02,712 --> 00:30:04,902
She called him... "the Doctor".
她称呼他为...“博士”

445
00:30:05,073 --> 00:30:07,418
Doctor?! Did you say "Doctor"?!
博士?! 你刚才是说了“博士”吗？

446
00:30:07,594 --> 00:30:10,983
He appears to have got through to our time.
He was seen by the guards.
他似乎也穿越到我们这个时代了, 警卫看见他了

447
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:18,409
The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks!
He must be found at once and exterminated!
博士是 Dalek 的敌人！必须立刻找到他, 予以终结！

448
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:41,518
Don't gloss over it, Anat, we failed!
别掩饰了, Anat, 我们失败了！

449
00:30:41,684 --> 00:30:44,115
We had no choice once our plan was known to them.
一旦我们的计划被他们所知晓, 我们就没有选择了

450
00:30:44,304 --> 00:30:46,532
If you'd listened to me,
we still could have done what was needed.
如果你当初听我的, 我们可能已经完成所需要做的了

451
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,534
We did all we could!
我们已经尽了我们所能！

452
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:51,561
Monia, our orders were to eliminate Styles, right?
Monia, 我们的命令是消灭 Styles, 对吧？

453
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:52,647
Yes, but you failed.
是的, 但你失败了

454
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:53,599
We could have succeeded.
我们本来可以胜利的

455
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:54,582
Then why didn't you?
那为什么你们没有？

456
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,924
He wasn't there! Security guards found us.
他不在那里！保安队又找到了我们

457
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:58,422
But Anat went soft.
但是 Anat 心软了

458
00:30:58,566 --> 00:30:59,303
Be quiet.
闭嘴

459
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:00,547
The trouble with you, Boaz is...
你的问题，Boaz，是...

460
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:04,401
Both of you! We have to think now.
The situation is different.
你俩都闭嘴！我们必须得想想了，处境不同了

461
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,980
As I see it, it's exactly the same -
we still have a job to do.
就我所见，完全一样，我们还是有活要干

462
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:12,146
No. There may be other ways.
I've had a report from one of our contacts.
不，可能有其它的路子。我收到一个线人的报告

463
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:15,546
A girl has been captured.
They're holding her prisoner at the control centre.
他们抓住了一个女孩儿，正把她扣押在控制中心

464
00:31:15,714 --> 00:31:19,001
The same girl - the one who operated
the time module at Styles' house?
就那个女孩儿吗？就在 Styles 房子里打开了时间模块的那个？

465
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:20,363
It fits your description.
跟你的描述相符

466
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:22,230
Well, at least she's alive.
哦，至少她还活着

467
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:25,156
In the hands of the Daleks? She won't live long.
在 Dalek 的手上？她活不长了

468
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:26,409
Can she tell them anything?
她会给他们透露什么吗？

469
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:29,234
Nothing of importance.
Have they picked up that Doctor yet?
没什么重要的。他们已经找到了博士没有？

470
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:33,330
Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
还没有，不过只是时间的问题

471
00:31:33,537 --> 00:31:37,149
Move! Move! Come along there, you scum!
走！快走！到那边去，你们这些渣子

472
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:46,289
Move! Come along there, move! Move! Go on!
走！到那边去，走！继续！

Well?
怎样？

Been captured. Taken for processing.
We must rescue him.

476
00:32:03,475 --> 00:32:05,239
I say we must!
我说了必须！

00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:07,069
Suicide.

Are you afraid?

479
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:15,203
Me? Of course I am. I'm not a fool.
What is he to us?
我？当然害怕，我又不是傻子。他是我们什么人？

480
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:18,183
We have fresh information from
one of our contacts at control centre.
我们从控制中心的线人那里收到了新消息

481
00:32:18,265 --> 00:32:22,483
He is the sworn enemy of the Daleks.
He is the one man they're afraid of - don't you see?
他是 Dalek 的宿敌，是他们所害怕的一个人，你明白了吗？

482
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:26,783
It's our only hope. If we don't act quickly,
it may be too late.
这是我们仅有的希望。不过我们不赶紧行动, 恐怕就来不及了

483
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:33,234
You are the Doctor! You are an enemy of the Daleks!
你是博士！你是 Dalek 的敌人！

484

Now you are in our power! You will be exterminated!

You will be exterminated! You will be exterminated!
你将被终结！你将被终结！你将被终结！你将被终结！

Stop! You mustn't kill him!
停下！你们不能杀了他！

- Don't you realise he can help us?
- 安静  - 你们没有意识到他可以帮助我们吗？

488
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:58,357
<i>The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks.</i>

- 你有证据吗？  - 我知道他在为他们工作

But look at him!
看看他！

494
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:16,603
You've practically killed him just
getting a simple admission of identity.
你们几乎把他弄死了, 他也才坦白承认他的身份而已

495
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:18,803
He'll die before he tells you anything else.
他在告诉你们任何其它事情之前, 就会死掉了

496
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:20,798
<i>What is your plan?</i>

497
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:23,681
Let me interrogate him.

00:33:30,847 --> 00:33:32,838
To put pressure on him through the girl.
通过那个女孩儿来给他施加压力

502
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,282
By the time I have finished with him,

00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:39,679
I shall be able to crush the guerrilla
organisation entirely!

Now, the control centre is here.

As far as we know, they're being held
prisoner in this block here.

507
00:33:51,187 --> 00:33:52,381

The disused underground railway of the old city.

There's an exit right by this wall.

I know the Doctor would help you if he could.

Yes, for your own purposes.

what their plans are,

I don't doubt it.
我不怀疑

Do you value life so little?

00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:18,977
On the contrary, I value it enormously.

518
00:34:20,507 --> 00:34:22,543
The Daleks will kill us whatever we tell you.
不管我们告诉你什么, Dalek 都会杀了我们

519
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,185

像你一样跟他们合作？

00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:28,624
Do you really think that makes any difference?

522
00:34:28,707 --> 00:34:31,904
- They can be reasonable!
- Reasonable?
- 他们不是讲理的？  - 讲理？

523
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,182
They tolerate you as long as you're useful to them.

524
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:36,178

You, sir, you, sir, are a traitor!

We have helped make things better for the others.

We have gained concessions. I have saved lives!

Wouldn't you have helped more
by organising the fight against them?

No one can fight against the Daleks.

532
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:57,704
That's not what your criminal guerrillas
seem to think, is it?

533
00:34:57,787 --> 00:35:00,062
A handful of fanatics?
那群疯子？

Most of them have been killed already.

they can do to change things.

- 终结！终结！终结！  - Anat, 小心!

Come! We must reach the control centre, come!

No! Come! Come!
不, 快, 快！

539
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:53,239
For the last time, I tell you
I haven't got any information.
最后一次我跟你说, 我没有任何信息

540
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:55,719
And quite frankly, even if I had,
I wouldn't give it to you!
而且非常坦白地说, 即使我有, 也不会给你！

541
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:57,286
- Right, stay where you are!  - Guards!
- 好, 待着别动！  - 警卫！

542
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:59,676
Guards? You have no guards. They're all dead.
警卫？你没有警卫了, 他们都死了

543
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:01,359
- Are you all right?  - Yes, thank you.
- 你没事吧？  - 是的, 谢谢你

544
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:03,961
- All the better for seeing you.
- You're coming with us.
- 见到你们太好了  - 你们跟我们走

545
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:06,277
No harm must come to these two.
Too much depends on them.
保护好他们俩不受伤, 太多事情取决于他们

546
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:09,439
- As for you, my friend...
- Put that gun down!
- 至于你, 我的朋友...  - 把枪放下！

547
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:11,686
There's no point in murdering him.
杀了他没有意义

548
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:13,405
You don't know how much blood
there is on his hands.
你不知道他手上有多少血

549
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:15,125
Nevertheless, he's not your real enemy.
不管怎样, 他不是你们真正的敌人

550
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:17,437
He's helped the Daleks. He's worked for them!
他在帮 Dalek, 他为他们工作！

551
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:20,121
They would always have found someone.
他们总是能找到一个人的

552
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:21,196
Now, just leave him.
现在, 留下他吧

553
00:36:24,127 --> 00:36:25,719
Right, let's go.
好了, 我们走

554
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:42,762
- But how do you know this?
- Oh, there are books.
- 但你们怎么知道这个  - 哦, 有书啊

555
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:45,645
Even during the wars, people found time
to study, to write about it.
就是在战争期间, 人们还是能找到时间研究、记录这事

556
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:48,241
What to you has not yet happened
is to us history.
对于你们还没有发生的事情, 对于我们已经是历史了

557
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:51,595
This history of yours,
it talks about Sir Reginald Styles?
你们的这个历史, 它说到了 Reginald Styles 爵士？

558
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:53,637
Oh, yeah, he pretended to be working for peace,
哦, 是的, 他假装为和平而工作

559
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:55,279
but really he just wanted power for himself.
但实际上他只是为他自己争取权力

560
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:57,278
So the conference he called was just a trick?
所以他召集的会议只是一个诡计？

561
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:59,881
He managed to lure the world leaders to
a remote country house
他设法把各国领导人骗到一个偏远的乡村房子里

562
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:03,516
and he pretended they needed absolute quiet
if the meeting was to succeed.
然后假装说他们需要绝对的安静, 否则会议没法成功

563
00:37:03,607 --> 00:37:05,996
But then, there was a devastating explosion...
但是接下来, 就发生了一场毁灭性的爆炸...

564
00:37:06,087 --> 00:37:08,157
And Styles was killed with the others.
然后 Styles 就跟其他人一起炸死了

565
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:10,397
He must have set a bomb and mistimed the charge.
他肯定是安放了一个炸弹, 但把时间设错了

566
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:12,762
There were accusations, counter-accusations,
然后就出现了指控、反指控

567
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:15,759
and then the wars began. That was the turning point.
战争就爆发了, 那就成了转折点

568
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:19,681
But if this true, Sir Reginald Styles
must be completely round the bend!
但如果这是真的, Reginald Styles 爵士一定完全气疯了！

569
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:22,281
Er, so, you went back into our time
呃, 所以, 你们就回到我们的时间点

570
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,642
to kill Styles before he could carry out his plan?
就为了在 Styles 实施他的计划之前杀死他？

571
00:37:24,727 --> 00:37:26,797
Right. We've been fighting the Daleks for years.
对, 我们跟 Dalek 斗了很多年

572
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:27,876
But it was hopeless.
但没什么希望

573
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:31,039
Eventually we must lose,
so we thought, what else can we do?
最终我们必然会输, 于是我们想, 我们还能做什么？

574
00:37:31,127 --> 00:37:32,480
We learnt through one of our spies
我们通过一个间谍了解到

575
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:35,400
that the Daleks had succeeded
in creating a time machine.
Dalek 成功创造了一种时间机器

576
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:39,162
We even managed to steal a copy of
the plans, and we built one of our own,
我们甚至设法偷了一份设计图, 自己造了一台

577
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:42,125
so that we could go back
into history to the exact point
以便我们可以回到历史中的确切时间点

578
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:45,405
With one action, we could stop them.
只要一次行动, 我们就可以阻止他们

579
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:47,842
Mankind could have a chance
to take a new direction!
人类就有了一个机会走向新的方向！

580
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:50,157
But even now, the transfer isn't always stable.
但即使到现在, 时间转移并不总是稳定

581
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:53,478
People materialised in your time
and then just faded away.
人在你们的时间出现, 然后又慢慢消失

582
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:54,636
The ghost that Styles saw?
Styles 看到的那个鬼魂？

583
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:57,560
Somehow, somehow the Daleks
found what we were doing.
不知怎地, Dalek 发现了我们在做什么

584
00:37:57,647 --> 00:38:01,401
And they sent Ogrons back into your time
after us and attacked one of our men.
他们派 Orgon 回到你们的时间追杀我们, 袭击了我们一个人

585
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,559
Well, that must have been the man
that we saw down by the canal tunnel.
哦, 那肯定就是在运河隧道边看见的那个人

586
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:06,763
You remember, Jo, the one who vanished
from the ambulance?
你还记得吗, Jo, 在救护车上消失的那个人？

587
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:08,724
Yes, we fixed on the tunnel
是的, 我们锁定了那个隧道

588
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:11,367
as a place that was stable
in your time and in ours.
那是在你们和我们的时间都稳定的一个地点

589
00:38:11,447 --> 00:38:14,644
We used it as a transfer point.
Well, you know the rest.
我们把它用作了传送点, 喏, 剩下的你们都知道了

590
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,995
Yes, well there's... There's one thing
I don't quite understand and that is
是的, 不过还有...还有一件事情我不太明白, 那就是

591
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:20,997
why were you so keen to rescue us?
And believe me, we're grateful, but...
你们为什么这么热衷于救我们？相信我, 我很感激, 但是...

592
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:24,081
Well, you told us yourself,
you're an old enemy of the Daleks.
哦, 你自己跟我们说过, 你是 Dalek 的老敌人

593
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:26,556
- Yes?
- Then you will help us to beat them.
- 是吗？  - 而且你会帮助我们打败他们

594
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:28,886
What do you expect me to do?
你们期望我做什么？

595
00:38:28,967 --> 00:38:31,435
Well, you can succeed where we've failed, Doctor.
就是, 在我们失败的地方获得成功, 博士

596
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:35,719
We want you to go back into your
own time and kill Styles.
我们期望你回到你的时间, 杀了 Styles

597
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:39,399
You're asking me to commit murder!
你们要求我去实施谋杀？

598
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:43,400
No! We're asking you to kill one man
and prevent millions more dying.
不！我们是在要求你去杀一人而救千千万万

599
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,682
- That is still murder.
- Isn't it worth it?
- 那还是谋杀  - 这样不值得吗？

600
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:48,156
- To save the human race from the Daleks?
- Yes, but would it?
- 就能从 Dalek 手中把人类救出来？  - 是的, 但能吗？

601
00:38:48,247 --> 00:38:50,078
We've told you how it happened.
我们告诉你们了, 这一切是怎么开始的

602
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:52,886
But your history could be wrong, you know.
但你们的历史可能是错的, 你知道吗？

603
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:57,643
Now, listen, why don't you
send us back to our time?
现在, 听着, 为什么你不把我们送回我们的时间？

604
00:38:57,727 --> 00:38:59,922
We know the future now,
maybe there are other things we can do?
我们现在已经知道了未来, 也许有其它事情我们可以做？

605
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,884
Monia, we're wasting valuable time!
Every minute that goes by...
Monia, 我们在浪费宝贵的时间！每流逝一分钟...

606
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,527
Doctor, will you help us? It's our only hope.
博士, 你会帮助我们吗？这是我们唯一的希望

607
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:08,361
I still can't believe that Sir Reginald
Styles is a ruthless murderer.
我还是无法相信 Reginald 爵士是一个冷血杀手

608
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:10,039
Yes, I agree, Jo.
是的, 我同意, Jo

609
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:12,277
Vain to the point of arrogance,
a trifle obstinate, perhaps,

610
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,676
but basically a good man.
但基本上还是个好人

611
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:19,885
So, if it happened, how did it happen?
所以, 如果那事发生了, 是怎么发生的呢？

612
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:25,237
Any of your people still in our time zone?
你们还有人在我们的时间区域吗？

613
00:39:25,327 --> 00:39:27,841
- No.  - Well, Shura.
- 没有  - 还有 Shura

614
00:39:27,927 --> 00:39:30,999
He left just to send a message and
we never saw nor heard from him again.
他离开我们去送一个信息, 我们就再也没有看到他, 没听到他

615
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:32,406
We assumed he must be dead.
我们估计他肯定死了

616
00:39:54,147 --> 00:39:57,239
Look, please believe me,
I'm completely with you about the ends.
看, 请相信我, 我在最终目标上跟你们是完全一致的

617
00:39:57,327 --> 00:39:59,081
I only disagree as to the means.
我只是不同意中间的手段

618
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:02,401
All right. What do you want to know?
好吧, 你想知道什么？

619
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:07,523
This mission of yours to the 20th century,
what did you take with you?
你们这次到20世纪的任务, 你们都带了什么东西过去？

620
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:10,076
The usual battle gear, radio, disintegrators...

621
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:13,762
- Any sabotage equipment?
- Only a few charges of Dalekenium.

622
00:40:14,327 --> 00:40:15,726
Dalekenium?

623
00:40:15,807 --> 00:40:18,037
It's a highly effective type of explosive.

624
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:20,766
We stole the formula from the Daleks.

625
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:23,924
- Could it destroy a house?
- What are you trying to say, Doctor?

626
00:40:25,447 --> 00:40:27,517
Well, don't you see? This has happened before!

627
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:29,040
What has?

628
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:32,156
You went back to change history,

629
00:40:32,247 --> 00:40:34,397
but you didn't change anything,
you became a part of it.

630
00:40:34,487 --> 00:40:36,398
What are you talking about?

631
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:39,877
If Styles didn't cause that explosion,
somebody else did.

632
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:41,764
Well, obviously, but who...

633
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,002
Shura!

634
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:46,840
Isn't that exactly what he would have done?

635
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:49,760
One last suicidal attempt to carry out his orders?

636
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:50,836
It's possible, I suppose.

637
00:40:50,927 --> 00:40:53,521
You're trapped in a temporal paradox!

638
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:56,766
Styles didn't cause that explosion
and start the wars,

639
00:40:57,927 --> 00:40:59,485
you did it yourselves!

640
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:04,121
<i>You have failed the Daleks.</i>
<i>The Doctor has escaped.</i>

641
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:06,442
He will be recaptured. I swear it!

642
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:09,325
<i>He must be found and destroyed.</i>

643
00:41:09,407 --> 00:41:11,841
He will attempt to return to his own time zone.

644
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:15,044
If those guerrillas are helping
him, they will use the tunnel

645
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:16,880
and I am setting up an ambush.

646
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:20,801
<i>If you fail us again,</i>
<i>you will pay with your life.</i>

647
00:41:20,887 --> 00:41:23,037
<i>This is your final chance.</i>

648
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:27,047
I will go and supervise the operations myself.

649
00:41:35,407 --> 00:41:37,363
Is everything ready?

650
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:40,804
Security forces have covered the whole tunnel.

651
00:41:41,287 --> 00:41:44,245
Don't worry, they won't escape a second time.

652
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:16,595
So it has ended as I said it would.

653
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,520
Did I not tell you it was madness
to fight the Daleks?

654
00:42:19,607 --> 00:42:22,963
Is it madness to want to see a world
free from their rule?

655
00:42:23,047 --> 00:42:24,878
- It can't be done.
- Oh, yes it can.

656
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:28,764
And I can do it. Are you going to stop me?

657
00:42:34,207 --> 00:42:37,995
Go. I will deal with these criminals myself.

658
00:42:39,887 --> 00:42:42,321
I said go!

659
00:42:49,087 --> 00:42:50,918
If only I could be sure.

660
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,157
You spoke of the war,

661
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:55,681
of its years of suffering and starvation.

662
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:00,204
Well, I can prevent all that happening, you know.

663
00:43:01,367 --> 00:43:05,679
You saved my life. You could have let them kill me.

664
00:43:07,687 --> 00:43:10,997
- Go, quickly.
- Thank you.

665
00:43:14,407 --> 00:43:16,637
Jo, come here and stand by me.

666
00:43:41,047 --> 00:43:42,958
Sergeant! They're here!

667
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,764
This is Sergeant Benton calling UNIT HQ.

668
00:43:45,847 --> 00:43:48,520
Look, we've found them.
Will you get a Jeep over here pronto?

669
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,722
This way, Doctor.

670
00:43:51,607 --> 00:43:54,041
I am sorry. They were too quick for us.

671
00:43:54,127 --> 00:43:55,446
They escaped in the darkness.

672
00:43:55,527 --> 00:43:59,361
<i>You are lying You have betrayed the Daleks.</i>

673
00:43:59,447 --> 00:44:02,280
No! I told you before,

674
00:44:02,367 --> 00:44:04,927
those security guards
are no match for humans.

675
00:44:05,007 --> 00:44:07,601
<i>You are a traitor to the Daleks.</i>

676
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:10,121
<i>You must be exterminated!</i>

677
00:44:10,207 --> 00:44:14,519
Who knows? I may have helped to exterminate you!

678
00:44:22,647 --> 00:44:26,959
<i>You have proved yourself worthy</i>
<i>to be the new Controller,</i>

679
00:44:27,047 --> 00:44:33,482
<i>but be warned, the Daleks demand total loyalty</i>
<i>from those who serve them.</i>

680
00:44:33,567 --> 00:44:34,886
Of course.

681
00:44:39,527 --> 00:44:43,315
<i>We must follow them into</i>
<i>the 20th century time zone.</i>

682
00:44:43,407 --> 00:44:46,001
<i>The peace conference must be destroyed.</i>

683
00:44:46,087 --> 00:44:47,645
<i>War must break out.</i>

684
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:52,164
<i>The Dalek conquest of the planet Earth</i>
<i>must not be reversed!</i>

685
00:45:07,527 --> 00:45:09,358
Look, you're supposed to be in charge of security.

686
00:45:09,447 --> 00:45:12,245
Kindly get on with your job
and leave me to get on with mine.

687
00:45:12,327 --> 00:45:15,319
Brigadier! Brigadier,
get everybody out of this house at once!

688
00:45:15,407 --> 00:45:16,556
Where the devil have you been?

689
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,285
Never mind all that.
Just clear this house immediately!

690
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:19,561
What's the man talking about?

691
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:21,877
Do as he says! Look, there isn't much time!

692
00:45:27,447 --> 00:45:31,122
<i>Locate and destroy the peace conference.</i>

693
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:37,279
<i>Exterminate!</i>

694
00:45:46,527 --> 00:45:48,802
<i>Destroy the human resistance!</i>

695
00:45:57,927 --> 00:46:00,077
<i>Eliminate all humans!</i>

696
00:46:00,527 --> 00:46:01,516
<i>Exterminate!</i>

697
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:05,360
<i>Exterminate!</i>

698
00:46:05,447 --> 00:46:08,484
Brigadier, get this man and all the
delegates out of this area immediately.

699
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:11,639
Use force if you have to!
Jo, you stay here.

700
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:14,601
- Sir Reginald, please?
- No, I will not permit it!

701
00:46:15,727 --> 00:46:16,796
Shura!

702
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:18,605
Get out of here unless you want to die too!

703
00:46:18,687 --> 00:46:20,439
I must kill Styles to prevent the war!

704
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,846
Shura, listen to me.

705
00:46:21,927 --> 00:46:25,158
Styles and all the delegates
are already leaving this house.

706
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:27,841
You detonate that bomb and you'll be
sacrificing yourself for nothing.

707
00:46:28,527 --> 00:46:31,519
Benton calling UNIT HQ,
Benton calling UNIT HQ,

708
00:46:31,607 --> 00:46:32,756
we just can't hold them, sir!

709
00:46:32,847 --> 00:46:34,724
Look, Benton, keep them back
as long as you can.

710
00:46:34,807 --> 00:46:37,082
Sir Reginald, this house is under attack
by a hostile force.

711
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:39,158
You will please consider yourself
under my orders.

712
00:46:39,247 --> 00:46:40,885
- Brigadier, I warn you...
- Now be quiet, sir!

713
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:41,956
- Captain Yates?
- Sir.

714
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:44,521
Get Sir Reginald and all the delegates
away from this area at once. 

715
00:47:24,207 --> 00:47:27,040
Locate and destroy the peace conference!

716
00:47:27,767 --> 00:47:30,281
Doctor! The Daleks, they're coming into the house!

717
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:32,881
- Daleks? You're lying!
- No, she's not.

718
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:36,039
They've come back to make sure that
their version of history isn't changed.

719
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:38,397
- Is everybody out of the house?
- Yes, everyone but us.

720
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,320
Get out of here. Let them come in!
Leave them to me!

721
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:43,875
- No, no! You must come with us!
- You don't understand!

722
00:47:43,967 --> 00:47:46,959
That's Dalekenium. It's the only thing
that's effective against the Daleks.

723
00:47:47,047 --> 00:47:48,480
Well, couldn't we set a time fuse?

724
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:51,320
No, this stuff's too unstable.
There just isn't time.

725
00:47:51,407 --> 00:47:54,205
This is something that I must do myself.
Now, get out!

726
00:47:54,927 --> 00:47:57,600
- Very well.
- Out!

727
00:48:01,047 --> 00:48:02,605
Greyhound to Trap One,
Greyhound to Trap One,

728
00:48:02,687 --> 00:48:04,643
do you read me? Over. Greyhound to...

729
00:48:04,727 --> 00:48:07,844
Tell your men to fall back.
Let the Daleks into the house.

730
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:08,962
Doctor, are you sure that...

731
00:48:09,047 --> 00:48:11,402
It may not make military sense
but it's the only way.

732
00:48:11,487 --> 00:48:14,206
All right. Brigadier to all units.

733
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:17,404
Let them pass! I say again, let them pass!

734
00:48:17,887 --> 00:48:19,798
Re-group on the main road, out!

735
00:48:22,247 --> 00:48:24,044
<i>Exterminate!</i>

736
00:48:25,287 --> 00:48:28,643
<i>Eliminate all humans. Exterminate!</i>

737
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:32,125
<i>The human delegates are inside the house.</i>

738
00:48:32,207 --> 00:48:33,799
<i>Enter and destroy.</i>

739
00:48:35,967 --> 00:48:40,085
<i>- Where are the delegates?</i>
<i>- Where is the man Styles?</i>

740
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:43,682
<i>They must be found and exterminated!</i>

741
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:46,520
Oh, no, not this time.

742
00:48:46,607 --> 00:48:48,165
This time it's going to be different!

743
00:48:55,407 --> 00:48:56,840
Well, what happened?

744
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:03,879
Your conference has been saved, Sir Reginald.

745
00:49:04,407 --> 00:49:07,877
Now it's up to you and your friends
to make sure it's a success.

746
00:49:07,967 --> 00:49:09,958
- You still have a choice.
- Don't worry.

747
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:12,917
We all know what will happen if we fail.

748
00:49:13,007 --> 00:49:16,682
So do we. We've seen it happen, haven't we, Jo?

749
00:49:17,767 --> 00:49:20,235
