Doctor, why don't you take a break?
博士, 你为什么不休息一下?

7
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,615
It's maddening, you know. So nearly there.
真很让人抓狂, 知道吧. 已经很接近了

If I could only cut out their override

I thought the TARDIS was working again.

What gave you that idea?

00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:39,175
Oh, being dragged off to an alien planet
five hundred years in the future, for example.
哦, 比如说, 我被拖到了五百年后的一颗外星

00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:41,575

with the miners and the colonists.
你知道的, 都是矿工啊殖民者啊那些事

My dear Jo, the TARDIS was being operated then
under remote control...

..by the High Council of the Time Lords.

Well, if it worked for them...
如果对他们来说这可以用...

00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:50,789
I don't want it to work for them.
I want it to work for me.
我不想它对他们可以用, 我想要它对我可以用

19
00:01:50,857 --> 00:01:53,889
No-one's going to turn me into
an interplanetary puppet.
任何人别想把我变成一个星际傀儡

20
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,857
Yes, of course. Why didn't I think of that before?

Yes, of course. I remember now.

Look, don't worry, my dear.
I know you're alarmed but you needn't be.
看, 别担心, 亲爱的. 我知道你紧张了, 但没有必要

23
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:21,441
Yes, well I think that should do it.
Why on Earth I never realised that...
是的, 我想这应该可以了. 为什么我从来没有意识到...

Oh no! What are you doing here?

but, erm, you are not there.

to explain really.
呃...这个, 的确有点难解释

29
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:37,279
This won't do at all!
We can't have two of us running about.
完全说不通! 不可能有两个我在这里乱转!

30
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:39,341
Yes, well don't worry. It will all sor...

Doctor! What happened?

Well, it's a very complicated thing - time - Jo.
这个, 它是一件很复杂的事情 - 时间 - Jo

33
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:51,536
Once you've begun tampering with it,
the oddest things start happening.
一旦你开始玩弄它, 奇怪的事情就会出现

34
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,917
But there was another you and another... me.

Well, where've they gone?

Back into their own time stream, of course.
退回到他们自己的时间流去了, 当然罗

- Or do I mean forward?
- But, Doctor, I don't understand...
- 或者我该说是前进?   - 但是, 博士, 我搞不明白...

38
00:03:01,262 --> 00:03:03,733
Look, Jo. Don't worry about it.
It was a freak affect.
听着, Jo, 别担心. 这是一个奇怪的现象

39
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:05,233
It's very unlikely to happen again.

40
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:06,967
Hold that and give me those papers.
拿着这个, 把纸夹给我

Sorry, Brigadier. I'm busy.

Yeah, so am I, Doctor, so am I.

Now then, you've heard of Sir Reginald Styles?

No, can't say that I have.

47
00:03:23,749 --> 00:03:25,970
Well isn't he the chief representative at the UN?
但他不是驻联合国首席代表吗?

48
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:28,422
That's right - key figure
at the latest summit conference.
正是 - 是最近的峰会上的关键人物

49
00:03:28,548 --> 00:03:30,537
My dear chap, I'm a scientist.
Not a politician.
我亲爱的小伙, 我是个科学家, 不是个政客

50
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:33,509
You know, Doctor, if you...
didn't spend so much time...
知道吗, 博士, 如果你...没有花那么多时间...

51
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,297
...tinkering around with this wretched contraption,
...摆弄这个可怜的装置的话

52
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,989
you'd realise just how bad
the international situation's become.
你就会意识到国际形势变得多么糟糕

53
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:40,166
Humans are always squabbling over something, Brigadier.
人类总是会为点什么事争论不休, 准将

54
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:43,925
Yes, well, this particular squabble
looks like ending up in a third world war.
是的, 不过, 这一次的争吵, 看起来像是要导致第三次世界大战

55
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:48,397
The Chinese delegation have refused to attend.
Without them, the conference can't even begin.
中国代表团拒绝出席. 没有他们, 会议甚至无法开始

56
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:50,397
Now Styles is flying to Peking in a few hours.
现在 Styles 几个小时后就要飞往北京

57
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,997
There's just a chance that he can
persuade them to change their minds.
他也许有机会说服他们改变主意

58
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:56,126
All right, Brigadier. So what's his problem?
好吧, 准将. 那他那里有什么问题?

59
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,906
Well, he was working late last night, down at Auderly...
他昨晚在 Auderly 工作到很晚...

60
00:03:59,021 --> 00:03:59,900
Where's that?
Auderly 是什么地方?

61
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,242
Auderly, Miss Grant, is a Government owned
country house about fifty miles north of London...
Auderly 是政府拥有的一栋乡村房子, 在伦敦北面大约50英里

62
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:05,622
- where the conference is due to be held.
- Oh.
- 和平会议将在那里进行  - 哦

63
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,613
He suddenly started behaving... rather oddly.
他突然开始表现得...相当奇怪

64
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,313
Seemed to think that someone
was trying to assassinate him.
似乎是觉得有人试图暗杀他

65
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,277
Any idea who?
知道是谁吗?

66
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:14,129
Some sort of "ghost" apparently.
看起来像是是某种 "鬼"

67
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,636
He said somebody attacked him and vanished.
他说有人袭击了他, 然后就消失了

68
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:30,493
And you're absolutely certain that
he used the word "ghost"?
你完全确定他用了 "鬼" 这个词吗?

69
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,483
Oh yes. But afterwards he...
嗯是的, 但随后他...

70
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:35,988
Miss Paget! What's going on here?!
Paget 小姐! 这是在干什么?

71
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:37,992
These people are from UNIT, sir.
这些人是 UNIT 的人, 先生

72
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:39,057
Who asked them to come here?

00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:40,963
I did - because of what happened yesterday.

Nothing happened yesterday.
昨晚没发生什么事

75
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,227
There seems to have been
some sort of incident, Sir Reginald?
似乎是发生了某种意外, Reginald 爵士?

76
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:46,319
Nothing of any importance.
没有什么重要的事

77
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:48,368
Well, if you could tell us what happened?
那, 你可以告诉我们到底发生了什么吗?

78
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:52,031
I was working late. I must have dropped off.
我工作到很晚, 然后肯定是睡着了

79
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,031
Freak gust of wind, blew some papers off my desk,

00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,531
I woke up rather confused,
I was picking up the papers..
我迷迷糊糊地醒过来, 开始捡那些文件

81
00:04:57,621 --> 00:05:00,623
- when Miss Paget came in.
- But you did mention ghosts.
- 这个时候 Paget 小姐进来的  - 但你的确之前提到过“鬼魂”

82
00:05:00,723 --> 00:05:03,228
Did I? Must have been having a nightmare.
有吗? 我肯定是做了噩梦了

83
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,224
But the French windows weren't shut.
I closed them before I went to bed.
但落地窗没有关闭. 我在上床之前是关了的

84
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:07,394
Then I must have opened them!
那肯定是我打开了它们!

85
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:13,092
Did you, er, did you also make
those marks on the floor over there?
是你, 呃, 也是你在那边地板上留下了那些痕迹吗?

86
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:18,092
Muddy feet, Sir Reginald.
Someone was in here, you know.
泥脚印, Reginald 爵士. 昨晚有人在这里, 你知道的

87
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:19,516
Are you accusing me of lying, sir?!

88
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,742
Sir Reginald, you've obviously been
under considerable strain recently.

I felt, and feel, perfectly well.

现在, 请原谅, 我还有好多事情要做. 一小时内要到机场

You've no objection to my men searching the grounds?
你不反对我的人把这里搜查一遍吧?

93
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,850
None at all. Though I really don't know
what you hope to find.
没问题. 虽然我真的不知道你想要找什么

94
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,795
Sergeant!
中士!

95
00:05:46,695 --> 00:05:50,299
Ah, he's in a bad way, poor chap.
You'd better get him to the hospital.
啊, 他情况不好, 可怜的家伙. 你最好把他送医院去

96
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:52,340
- Captain Yates...  - Right away, sir.
- Yates 队长...  - 马上, 头儿

97
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:59,481
This is a new one on me.
What do you make of it, Doctor?
这我都没见过. 你对它有什么想法, 博士?

98
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:03,257
I'm not sure...
我不确定...

99
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:04,233
Sir?
头儿?

100
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,537
What've you got there, Benton?
你找到了什么, Benton?

101
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:07,827
No idea, sir.
不知道, 头儿

102
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:10,539
It was hidden about fifty feet inside the tunnel.

103
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:19,162
Have you seen this before?
你以前见过这个吗?

104
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:22,586
Really Brigadier! What sort of games are you playing?
真的吗, 准将! 你到底在玩什么游戏?

105
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,967
It's not a game, sir. It's our duty to protect you!
这不是游戏, 先生. 保护你是我们的责任!

106
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:26,562
I don't need your protection!
我不需要你们的保护!

107
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:31,295
Sir Reginald, we've just found a very severely
injured man down by the canal tunnel.
Reginald 爵士, 我们在运河隧道边发现一个严重受伤的人

108
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:33,555
Oh really? And what did he look like?
哦真的吗? 他什么样子?

109
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:38,723
Thirty-fiveish, average build.
He was wearing a sort of guerilla combat suit.
大约25岁, 中等身材, 穿着一种迷彩作战服

110
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,871
- And carrying that gun.
- I am very sorry, gentlemen,
- 还带着枪  - 我很抱歉, 先生们

111
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:44,396
but I have rather more important things
on my mind at the moment.
但我这会儿还想着更加重要的事情

112
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:47,247
- If you'll excuse me?
- I've arranged an escort to take you to the airport, sir.
- 抱歉了?   - 我安排几个人护送你到机场去, 爵士

113
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:48,708
Thank you, but it shouldn't be necessary.
谢谢你, 但这并没有必要

114
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:50,300
I'm sorry, sir, but I think it will!
抱歉, 爵士, 但我觉得有必要

115
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:51,631
Oh, if you insist.
哦, 你非得坚持

116
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,512
I'd like to get that gun down to the laboratory
and run a few tests on it.
我得把那把枪拿到实验室去, 做几个测试

117
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:05,362
Well, basically it's a form of ultra-sonic disintegrator.
好了, 基本上来说它是一种超声裂解枪

118
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:06,361
You mean a ray gun?
你是说射线枪?

119
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:08,514
That's right, Jo, I mean a ray gun.
说对了, Jo, 我是说射线枪

120
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:11,814
Only it's far more sophisticated
than any weapon yet invented on Earth.
只不过它比地球上说造的任何武器都复杂

121
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:13,214
Now take a look at this.
现在看这个

122
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:19,825
Quite an effective little weapon, eh?
非常厉害的小武器, 是哈?

123
00:07:21,236 --> 00:07:25,472
Doctor, you say this wasn't made on Earth.
Do you mean it comes from another planet?
博士, 你说它不是在地球上造的, 那就是说它来自其它星球?

124
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,479
Well that was my theory at first, yes.
这也是我一开始的想法, 是

125
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,979
But the metallurgical analysis shows that the,
er, iron constituent is very much of this world.
但是材料分析却表明, 它的钢铁成分与这个世界高度相似

126
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,779
In fact, it was mined not very far from here
- North Wales.
事实上, 就来自离这里不远的地方 - 北威尔士

127
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:37,761
How do you explain that?
那你怎么解释?

128
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:42,080
Do you believe in ghosts, Brigadier?
你相信鬼魂吗, 准将?

129
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,247
Let's be serious, Doctor.
我们说正经的, 博士

130
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:44,292
I am.
我很正经

131
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:45,792
Oh, come along, Doctor, come along.
哦, 得了, 博士, 拉倒吧

132
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:50,714
Oh, my mistake. I was forgetting
the unimaginative nature of the military mind.
哦, 我错了, 我忘记了一个军人的大脑是没有想象力的

133
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:54,214
But we saw a couple of "Amicus Seperatus"
a few moments ago, didn't we, Jo?
当我们在不久之前见到 Amicus Seperatus 现象了, 对不, Jo?

134
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:55,202
Did we?
有吗?

135
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:56,725
Yes, here in this laboratory.
是的, 就在这实验室

136
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:57,985
Oh, you mean when we...
哦, 你是说我们那时...

137
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,697
Mind you, they were manifestations
of a much more benevolent kind.
注意, 他们是非常仁慈友好的那种类型

138
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,297
None of your clanking chains and chilly fingers!
不是你们那种有丁丁当当的脚链和可怕的手指的魔鬼

139
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,197
But ghosts, none the less.
但不管怎样, 的确是＂鬼魂＂

140
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:09,942
That was because you were playing around
with the time mechanism on the TARDIS, wasn't it?
那是因为你当时在折腾 TARDIS 的时间机制, 是吧?

141
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:11,934
Still can't get it to work, eh?
还是没法让它工作啊, 嗯?

142
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:13,918
Well, I can't get this thing to work, either.
是啊, 我也不能让它工作

143
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:18,588
But this is a form of, er, of time machine
of a very crude kind.
但这是一个, 呃, 时间机器, 比较粗糙的那种

144
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:19,935
How do you know?
你怎么知道?

145
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:21,305
Come over here. Look at this.
到这里来, 看看这个

146
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:24,158
Now what do you think that is?
你觉得这是什么?

147
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,885
Ooh, it's a... mini-dematerialisation circuit.
哦, 这是个...迷你型的反物化电路

148
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:29,853
Top of the class, Jo.
Now then, pop this in here, like that.
优等生, Jo. 然后, 把这个塞到这里, 这样

149
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,150
Now, as far as I can gather,
when you push this button, it should...
现在, 据我的推断, 一旦你按下这个按钮, 它就可以...

150
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:36,637
Good grief! It's working!
老天爷, 它可以工作了!

151
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:46,898
Sir?
头儿?

152
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:48,255
What is it?
什么事?

153
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:51,292
Time transmitter in operation, sir.
Twentieth Century Zone.
时间发射器在运转了, 头儿, 在20世纪区域

154
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:53,565
Can you fix the space-time coordinates?
你能锁定时空坐标吗?

155
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,053
Do be careful, Doctor!
小心点, 博士!

156
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,882
All right, Jo, all right.
没事的, Jo, 没事

157
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,305
- Well?  - No good, sir.
- 怎样  - 不妙, 头儿

158
00:08:58,427 --> 00:09:02,208
There was a transference, I think,
but the machine's cut out completely.
刚才有干扰, 我觉得, 然后机器就完全切断了

159
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:07,234
Continue scanning - and next time
you had better be more efficient!
继续扫描 - 下次你最好效率高点

160
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,417
Report!
报告!

161
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:13,695
Yes, I see. All right, sergeant.
是的, 我明白, 没事, 中士.

162
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:16,695
You'd better report back to Captain Yates. Goodbye.
你最好报告给 Yates 队长, 再见

163
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:19,987
That was Benton. He was in the ambulance
with the man we found.
是 Benton, 他刚才跟我们找到的那个人一起在救护车上

164
00:09:20,096 --> 00:09:20,920
Well?
怎么了?

165
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:26,999
Well according to him, that man just...
vanished, faded away
据他所说, 那个人刚刚...不见了, 消失掉了

166
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:29,246
- like a ghost.  - Oh no!
- 像鬼一样  - 噢, 不!

167
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:30,904
Well, Doctor, what now?
那, 博士, 现在怎么办?

168
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:34,166
Well, everything that happens seems to
centre round Styles' house.
嗯, 发生的所有这些事似乎都跟 Style 的房子有关

169
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:35,532
Obviously.
这显然

170
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:37,604
And whoever tried to harm him will probably try again.
那些试图伤害他的人, 很可能还会再次下手

171
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:43,940
Jo, how would you like to spend the night
in a haunted house?
Jo, 你觉得到闹鬼的房子里过一晚怎么样?

172
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:08,846
Wake up, Jo.
醒醒, Jo

173
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:10,678
It's all right. It's morning.
没什么事, 天亮了

174
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,052
Nothing's happened?
什么都没发生?

175
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:13,175
No, nothing at all.
没有, 完全没有

176
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:50,901
Jo! Jo!
Jo! Jo!﻿

177
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:34,224
Please! Turn that machine off
- or they'll kill all of us! Please!
拜托, 把那个机器关掉 - 不然他们会把我们都杀死! 求你了

178
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:41,237
- Sir?  - Yes?
- 头儿?   - 怎么了?

179
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:43,492
We've picked up that time transmitter again.
我们又识别到那个时间发射器了

180
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:44,377
You're sure?
你确定吗?

181
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:48,166
Yes, sir. Same frequency, same time...
time zone. Much stronger now.
是的, 头儿. 同样的频率同样的时间..时区. 现在信号强多了

182
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,427
Right. I want the exact space-time co-ordinates,
so whatever happens, don't lose it!
好, 我要确切的时空坐标, 所以不管发生什么, 不要跟丢了

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,300
What is your report?
你要报告什么?

184
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,436
We have a fix on the time transfer device.
我们已经锁定了那个时间传送装置

185
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:07,436
It is operating again in the twentieth century
time zone and it must be them.
它在20世纪区域再次开启, 肯定是他们

186
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:13,131
You have obtained the space-time co-ordinates?
你已经得到了时空坐标?

187
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:16,819
We're trying now.
The trace is much stronger this time.
我们正在努力, 这次信号强多了

188
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:19,726
- There is every chance...
- You must not fail!
- 这次肯定有机会...  - 你必须成功!

189
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,278
Security forces are standing by.
安全部队已经在待命了

190
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,778
If we do get the co-ordinates,
what are your instructions?
如果我们拿到坐标, 你们有什么指示?

191
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:36,737
Whoever is operating the time machine
is an enemy of the Daleks.
不管是谁在操作那个时间机器, 他都是 Daleks 的敌人

192
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:42,937
All enemies of the Daleks must be destroyed!
Exterminate them!
而 Daleks 的所有敌人都必须消灭! 终结他们!

193
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:44,839
Let him go.
让我走

194
00:12:45,913 --> 00:12:48,236
Now then - turn off that machine.
既然如此, 关掉机器

195
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:07,178
I have to report that we have lost the trace.
It was operating only a few moments.
我不得不说我们跟丢了, 它仅仅只开启了一小会儿

196
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:13,993
We are not interested in excuses.
Find them! Find them! Find them!
我们对借口不感兴趣! 找到他们, 找到他们, 找到他们!

197
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:16,848
No last words of repentance, Sir Reginald?
死到临头了你忏悔不, Reginald 爵士?

198
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:20,950
No, only that you're making one fundamental mistake...
不, 你犯了一个很基础的错误...

199
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:22,050
That is?
是什么?

200
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,555
A question of mistaken identity.
I am not Sir Reginald Styles.
你认错人了, 我不是 Reginald Styles 爵士

201
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,749
Is that the best you can do?
你就只会玩这个?

202
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:31,685
But it's true! Sir Reginald...
但这是事实! Reginald 爵士他...

203
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:34,495
Sir Reginald is at this moment
many thousands of miles away -
Reginald 爵士这会儿正在千里之外

204
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:37,695
in Peking, to be precise.
确切地说, 在北京

205
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:39,383
You are lying.
你在撒谎

206
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:42,697
No, I'm not. He flew there yesterday.
不, 我没有. 他昨天就飞过去了

207
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,012
I do not believe you.
我不相信你

208
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,747
It's all there in the paper in front of you.
Why don't you take a look?
这全都在你面前的报纸上, 你为什么不看一眼?

209
00:13:54,508 --> 00:13:56,466
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
很抱歉让你失望了

210
00:13:56,638 --> 00:13:58,112
It's a trick - kill him now!
这是个伎俩 - 现在就杀了他!

211
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:00,295
If you are not Sir Reginald Styles
如果你不是 Reginald Styles

212
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:03,295
who are you and what are you doing in his house?
那你是谁, 你在他的房子里做什么?

213
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:05,772
Well, believe it or believe it not,
I came here to see you.
嗯, 不知道你们信不信, 我是来见你们的

214
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,563
We're wasting time, Anat. Here, I'll do it.
我们这是在浪费时间, Anat. 来, 我来下手

215
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:09,928
Who is in command of this mission?!
这次任务谁是指挥官? !

216
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,837
We are soldiers, not murderers.
我们是战士, 不是杀人犯

217
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:16,507
Keep guard outside, I'll deal with these two.
出去警戒, 我来对付这两个

218
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:18,474
I said out!
我说了出去

219
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:34,100
Now then, answer my question -
who are you and what are you doing here?
现在, 回答我的问题 - 你是谁, 在这里做什么?

220
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,224
- I wanted to talk to you.  - Why?
- 我想来跟你们谈谈  - 为什么?

221
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,178
To find out where you came from.
And more to the point - when.
为了搞明白你们从哪里来, 更重要的是, 从何时来

222
00:14:41,316 --> 00:14:43,299

223
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:46,828
Down there!

Captain Yates, sir, on four.

I can't speak to him now.

is happening at Auderly House.

228
00:14:56,557 --> 00:14:59,457
If you could have a quick word with him, sir?

229
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:00,613
All right.
好吧

230
00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:01,791
Yes, what is it, Yates?
是我, 什么事, Yates?

231
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:05,030
A couple of my men missing, sir,
and the Doctor and Miss Grant -
我有几个人不见了, 头儿, 还有博士和Grant小姐

232
00:15:05,118 --> 00:15:06,850
- not a sign of them
- Look really, Yates,
- 他们一点踪迹没有  - 听着, 真的, Yate

233
00:15:06,945 --> 00:15:09,950
I've got a major international crisis on.
I really haven't got time for any...
我这里有一个严重的国际危机, 我真的没时间来...

- One moment, sir.
- 是的, 部长在这里  - 稍等, 先生

Have you finished?

Quietly!
安静!

241
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,132
Oh, that's better.
噢, 好多了

242
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:51,949
You know, I've got a good mind
to let you stay like that!

00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:53,000
So much more peaceful.
安静多了

244
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:58,422
In any case, even if I released you,
you'll probably ask me a lot of fool questions!
不管怎样, 如果我放开你, 你就很可能问我很多傻问题!

245
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:02,426
I've only got one question - who are they?
我就只有一个问题 - 他们是谁?

246
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:04,821
On the face of it, three rather desperate people.
从表情上看, 是三个挺绝望的人

247
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,487
Well, they're criminals - they must be!
但是, 他们是罪犯 - 他们肯定是

248
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:07,599
Ah, you're prejudiced.
啊, 你这是偏见

249
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:10,398
Well, aren't you? They tried to kill you and me.
那你不是? 他们试图杀了你和我

250
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,887
That's not in their favour, I'll admit.
那对他们也没什么好处, 我得承认

251
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:15,987
You know, we shouldn't really judge 'em
until we find out why they're here.
在我们搞明白他们为什么到这里来之前, 我们不能乱下断言

252
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:18,219
We are maintaining constant watch,
我们在持续监视

253
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:21,819
but there is no sign of any
time transference module in operation.
但没有发现时间传送模块运转的迹象

254
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:25,791
All criminal elements must be
tracked down and destroyed.
所有的犯罪行为必须要追踪到, 要消灭

255
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,329
Well, I am doing everything possible, but...
是的, 我正在尽一切可能, 但是...

256
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:33,573
They will have returned to the time zone
where the first criminal was eliminated.
他们将会返回原时区, 也就是第一个罪犯被消灭的地方

257
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:38,373
You will dispatch security forces to search for them.
你得派遣安全部队去搜寻

258
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:40,795
Of course... at once.
当然... 马上执行

259
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:42,943
And the new equipment?
那新设备呢?

260
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,577
The Time Vortex Magnetron is set to the frequency
of the module that was traced.
时间涡流磁控管的频率, 已经调到与被追踪的模块一致了

261
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:56,277
Anyone using that module will be diverted
in the space-time vortex and attracted here.
任何人使用那个模块, 都会被时空涡流转移到这里来

262
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:58,484
But only if that particular module is used?
但只有使用那个特定的模块才会这样吧?

263
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:01,093
It is necessary to know the frequency.
知道频率是很有必要的

264
00:17:01,242 --> 00:17:03,836
But surely no one will use the module?
They must realise that we can trace them...
但肯定没人将会使用这个模块? 他们肯定意识到我们可以追踪到他们...

265
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:10,480
Do not dispute with the Daleks!
The function of the human is to obey!
不要跟 Dalek 争辩! 人类的功能就是服从!

266
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,680
Activate the Magnetron!
激活磁控管!

267
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:26,257
...to base. Intercept to base. Do you coordinate?
..呼叫基地, 拦截小组呼叫基地, 你们能定位吗?

268
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:29,857
Do you coordinate? Intercept...

00:25:23,243 --> 00:25:27,045
Come on, Boaz, out! Out, out!

406
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:35,383
How do you do?
你好吗?

407
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:56,895
Doctor, what on earth's going on?
博士, 这里到底怎么回事?

408

Thank you, Brigadier, for that timely intervention.

Yes, well, I'll explain about him later.

Excuse me, old chap, I'm in a hurry.

Get back! Get back!

Keep away!

_ or you'll be caught in the time field!
你闯入时间域了!

417
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:20,095
We warned you.
我们警告过你

418
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:22,508
Yes, yes, so you did.
是的, 是的, 是这样

419
00:27:22,677 --> 00:27:26,514
This may come as a shock to you, but you've just
travelled two hundred years through time.
有一点可能会让你感到震惊, 但你刚刚穿越了两百年的时间

420
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:32,471
Thank you. But I'm probably more familiar
with the concept of time travel than you are.
谢谢. 但我可能比你更熟悉时间旅行的概念

421
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:36,447
Now wait a minute.
Before the time transference, I saw a Dalek.
现在等一下, 在时间转移之前, 我看到了一个 Dalek

422
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,958
- You know of the Daleks?  - Indeed I do.
- 你知道 Dalek ?  - 我确实知道

423
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:42,296
I know them only too well.
They've been my bitterest enemy for many years.
我太了解他们了. 他们多年来一直是我最痛苦的敌人

424
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:44,193
Then you're a fool to have
let yourself be brought here!
那你让自己被带到这里来, 就太傻了

425
00:27:44,338 --> 00:27:46,617
Look, I came here in order to find Miss Jo Grant.
听着, 我来这里是为了找到 Jo Geant 小姐

426
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:48,607
I told you, she's probably dead.

But as long as there's a chance...

00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:51,048
Come on, Anat.
快点, Anat

Wait a minute - what is my best way of finding her?
等一下 - 我找到她的最好方法是什么?

430
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:54,015
That's your problem.
那是你的问题

431
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:55,223
We can't just leave him!

Run, Doctor - run!
跑, 博士 - 快跑!

Report!

435
00:29:03,257 --> 00:29:06,585
The security guards have combed the tunnels.
They've found nothing.

00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:10,056
You have failed the Daleks!
You will be punished!
你辜负了 Dalek! 你将会受到惩罚!

437
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:14,224
The fault is not mine!
Your security guards let them get away.
错不在我! 你们的警卫让他们跑了

438
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:18,161

- They are loyal to the Daleks.
- 那些生物一点用没有!  - 他们对 Dalek 很忠诚

439
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:22,232
As loyal as they are stupid!
They will never be a match for human guerillas.
同样也很愚蠢! 他们永远不会是人类游击队的对手

440
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:26,083
No one can succeed who opposes the Daleks.
跟 Dalek 作对的人没一个成功

441
00:29:26,253 --> 00:29:29,183
For every guerilla cell that you destroy,
another one springs up.
你每消灭一个游击队成员, 另一个又站起来了

442
00:29:29,293 --> 00:29:31,483
They have stolen your time machines
and copied them.

They steal your weapons, your explosives.

The Daleks will destroy them.
这些罪犯将会被终结. Dalek 将摧毁他们

00:29:38,615 --> 00:29:41,602
If only you would let me recruit
more human security guards...
要是你们能让我招募更多的人类警卫就好了...

446
00:29:41,826 --> 00:29:44,311
Humans are treacherous and unreliable!
人类都很狡猾, 不可靠!

447
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,592
Not all humans. I have served you faithfully.
并非所有人这样, 我就一直忠实地为你们服务

448
00:29:48,771 --> 00:29:52,572
Do not dispute with the Daleks!
Obey without question!
不要与 Dalek 争辩! 毫无疑问地服从!

449
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,702
Very well. There was one... curious thing.

The girl referred to a companion

451
00:30:02,712 --> 00:30:05,102
She called him... "the Doctor".

452
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,518
Doctor?! Did you say "Doctor"?!
博士?! 你刚才是说了“博士”吗?

453
00:30:07,624 --> 00:30:11,283
He appears to have got through to our time.
He was seen by the guards.
他似乎也穿越到我们这个时代了, 警卫看见他了

454
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:18,409
The Doctor is an enemy of the Daleks!
He must be found at once and exterminated!
博士是 Dalek 的敌人! 必须立刻找到他, 予以终结!

455
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:41,618
Don't gloss over it, Anat, we failed!
别掩饰了, Anat, 我们失败了!

456
00:30:41,724 --> 00:30:44,115
We had no choice once our plan was known to them.
一旦我们的计划被他们知晓, 我们就已经没有选择了

457
00:30:44,304 --> 00:30:46,532
If you'd listened to me,
we still could have done what was needed.
如果你当初听我的, 我们可能已经完成所需要做的了

458
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,634
We did all we could!
我们已经尽了我们所能!

459
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:51,561
Monia, our orders were to eliminate Styles, right?
Monia, 我们的命令是消灭 Styles, 对吧?

460
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:52,647
Yes, but you failed.
是的, 但你失败了

461
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:54,599
- We could have succeeded.
- Then why didn't you?
- 我们本来可以胜利的  - 那为什么你们没有?

462
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,924
He wasn't there! Security guards found us.
他不在那里! 警卫队又发现了我们

463
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:58,422
But Anat went soft.
但是 Anat 心软了

464
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,503

- The trouble with you, Boaz, is...
- 闭嘴  - 你的问题, Boaz, 是...

465
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:04,401
Both of you! We have to think now.
The situation is different.
你俩都闭嘴! 我们必须得想想了, 处境不同了

466
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,980
As I see it, it's exactly the same -
we still have a job to do.
就我所见, 完全一样, 我们还是有活要干

467
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:12,146
No. There may be other ways.
I've had a report from one of our contacts.
不, 可能有其它的路子. 我收到一个线人的报告

468
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:15,546
A girl has been captured.
They're holding her prisoner at the control centre.
他们抓住了一个女孩儿, 正把她扣押在控制中心

00:31:15,714 --> 00:31:19,001
The same girl - the one who operated
the time module at Styles' house?
就那个女孩儿吗? 在 Styles 房子里打开了时间模块的那个?

470
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:20,363
It fits your description.
跟你的描述相符

471
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:22,230
Well, at least she's alive.
好了, 至少她还活着

472
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:25,156
In the hands of the Daleks? She won't live long.

473
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:26,409
Can she tell them anything?
她会向他们透露什么吗?

474

Nothing of importance.
Have they picked up that Doctor yet?

Not yet. It's only a matter of time.

Move! Move! Come along there, you scum!

477
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:41,889

We must rescue him.

What is he to us?

We have fresh information from
one of our contacts at control centre.

他是 Dalek 的宿敌, 是他们所害怕的一个人, 你明白了吗?

00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:26,783
It's our only hope. If we don't act quickly,
it may be too late.
这是我们仅有的希望. 不过我们不赶紧行动, 恐怕就来不及了

00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:33,234
You are the Doctor! You are an enemy of the Daleks!

getting a simple admission of identity.

He'll die before he tells you anything else.

To put pressure on him through the girl.

On the contrary, I value it enormously.

The Daleks will kill us whatever we tell you.

- They can be reasonable!

如果你组织人跟他们斗, 不是会帮助更多人吗?

538
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:54,421
No one can fight against the Daleks.
没人能跟 Dalek 斗

539
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:57,704
That's not what your criminal guerrillas
seem to think, is it?
你那些游击队罪犯可不这么想, 是吧?

540
00:34:57,787 --> 00:35:00,062
A handful of fanatics?
那群疯子?

541
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:02,900
Most of them have been killed already.
他们的大多数都已经被杀了

542
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:08,141
I assure you, there is nothing
they can do to change things.
我向你保证, 没有他们可以改变的事情

543
00:35:21,147 --> 00:35:24,184
<i>- Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>
- Anat, look out!
- 终结! 终结! 终结!   - Anat, 小心!

544
00:35:40,587 --> 00:35:42,657
Come! We must reach the control centre, come!
快, 我们必须赶到控制中心, 来!

545
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,297
No! Come! Come!
不, 快, 快!

546
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:53,239
For the last time, I tell you
I haven't got any information.
最后一次我跟你说, 我没有任何信息

547
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:55,719
And quite frankly, even if I had,
I wouldn't give it to you!
而且非常坦白地说, 即使我有, 也不会给你!

548
00:35:55,807 --> 00:35:57,286
- Right, stay where you are!  - Guards!
- 好, 待着别动!   - 警卫!

549
00:35:57,367 --> 00:35:59,676
Guards? You have no guards. They're all dead.
警卫? 你没有警卫了, 他们都死了

550
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:01,359
- Are you all right?  - Yes, thank you.
- 你没事吧?   - 是的, 谢谢你

551
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:03,961
- All the better for seeing you.
- You're coming with us.
- 见到你们太好了  - 你们跟我们走

552
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:06,277
No harm must come to these two.
Too much depends on them.
保护好他们俩不受伤, 太多事情取决于他们

553
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:09,439
- As for you, my friend...
- Put that gun down!
- 至于你, 我的朋友...  - 把枪放下!

554
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:11,686
There's no point in murdering him.
杀了他没有意义

555
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:13,405
You don't know how much blood
there is on his hands.
你不知道他手上有多少血

556
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:15,125
Nevertheless, he's not your real enemy.
不管怎样, 他不是你们真正的敌人

557
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:17,437
He's helped the Daleks. He's worked for them!
他在帮 Dalek, 他为他们工作!

558
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:20,121
They would always have found someone.
他们总是能找到一个人的

559
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:21,196
Now, just leave him.
现在, 留下他吧

560
00:36:24,127 --> 00:36:25,719
Right, let's go.
好了, 我们走

561
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:42,762
- But how do you know this?
- Oh, there are books.
- 但你们怎么知道这个  - 哦, 有书啊

562
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:45,645
Even during the wars, people found time
to study, to write about it.
就是在战争期间, 人们还是能找到时间研究、记录这事

563
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:48,241
What to you has not yet happened
is to us history.
对于你们还没有发生的事情, 对于我们已经是历史了

564
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:51,595
This history of yours,
it talks about Sir Reginald Styles?
你们的这个历史, 它说到了 Reginald Styles 爵士?

565
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:53,637
Oh, yeah, he pretended to be working for peace,
哦, 是的, 他假装为和平而工作

566
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:55,279
but really he just wanted power for himself.
但实际上他只是为他自己争取权力

567
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:57,278
So the conference he called was just a trick?
所以他召集的会议只是一个诡计?

568
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:59,881
He managed to lure the world leaders to
a remote country house
他设法把各国领导人骗到一个偏远的乡村房子里

569
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:03,516
and he pretended they needed absolute quiet
if the meeting was to succeed.
然后假装说他们需要绝对的安静, 否则会议没法成功

570
00:37:03,607 --> 00:37:05,996
But then, there was a devastating explosion...
但是接下来, 就发生了一场毁灭性的爆炸...

571
00:37:06,087 --> 00:37:08,157
And Styles was killed with the others.
然后 Styles 就跟其他人一起炸死了

572
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:10,397
He must have set a bomb and mistimed the charge.
他肯定是安放了一个炸弹, 但把时间设错了

573
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:12,762
There were accusations, counter-accusations,
然后就出现了指控、反指控

574
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:15,759
and then the wars began. That was the turning point.
战争就爆发了, 那就成了转折点

575
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:19,681
But if this true, Sir Reginald Styles
must be completely round the bend!
但如果这是真的, Reginald Styles 爵士一定完全气疯了!

576
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:22,281
Er, so, you went back into our time
呃, 所以, 你们就回到我们的时间点

577
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,642
to kill Styles before he could carry out his plan?
就为了在 Styles 实施他的计划之前杀死他?

578
00:37:24,727 --> 00:37:26,797
Right. We've been fighting the Daleks for years.
对, 我们跟 Dalek 斗了很多年

579
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:27,876
But it was hopeless.
但没什么希望

580
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:31,039
Eventually we must lose,
so we thought, what else can we do?
最终我们必然会输, 于是我们想, 我们还能做什么?

581
00:37:31,127 --> 00:37:32,480
We learnt through one of our spies
我们通过一个间谍了解到

582
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:35,400
that the Daleks had succeeded
in creating a time machine.
Dalek 成功创造了一种时间机器

583
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:39,162
We even managed to steal a copy of
the plans, and we built one of our own,
我们甚至设法偷了一份设计图, 自己造了一台

584
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:42,125
so that we could go back
into history to the exact point
以便我们可以回到历史中的确切时间点

585
00:37:43,687 --> 00:37:45,405
With one action, we could stop them.
只要一次行动, 我们就可以阻止他们

586
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:47,842
Mankind could have a chance
to take a new direction!
人类就有了一个机会走向新的方向!

587
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:50,157
But even now, the transfer isn't always stable.
但即使到现在, 时间转移并不总是稳定

588
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:53,478
People materialised in your time
and then just faded away.
人在你们的时间出现, 然后又慢慢消失

589
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:54,636
The ghost that Styles saw?
Styles 看到的那个鬼魂?

590
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:57,560
Somehow, somehow the Daleks
found what we were doing.
不知怎地, Dalek 发现了我们在做什么

591
00:37:57,647 --> 00:38:01,401
And they sent Ogrons back into your time
after us and attacked one of our men.
他们派 Orgon 回到你们的时间追杀我们, 袭击了我们一个人

592
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,559
Well, that must have been the man
that we saw down by the canal tunnel.
哦, 那肯定就是在运河隧道边看见的那个人

593
00:38:04,647 --> 00:38:06,763
You remember, Jo, the one who vanished
from the ambulance?
你还记得吗, Jo, 在救护车上消失的那个人?

594
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:08,724
Yes, we fixed on the tunnel
是的, 我们锁定了那个隧道

595
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:11,367
as a place that was stable
in your time and in ours.
那是在你们和我们的时间都稳定的一个地点

596
00:38:11,447 --> 00:38:14,644
We used it as a transfer point.
Well, you know the rest.
我们把它用作了传送点, 喏, 剩下的你们都知道了

597
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,995
Yes, well there's... There's one thing
I don't quite understand and that is...
是的, 不过还有...还有一件事情我不太明白, 那就是...

598
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,997
why were you so keen to rescue us?
And believe me, we're grateful, but...
你们为什么这么热衷于救我们? 相信我, 我很感激, 但是...

599
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:24,081
Well, you told us yourself,
you're an old enemy of the Daleks.
哦, 你自己跟我们说过, 你是 Dalek 的老敌人

600
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:26,556
- Yes?
- Then you will help us to beat them.
- 是吗?   - 而且你会帮助我们打败他们

601
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:28,886
What do you expect me to do?
你们期望我做什么?

602
00:38:28,967 --> 00:38:31,435
Well, you can succeed where we've failed, Doctor.
就是, 在我们失败的地方获得成功, 博士

603
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:35,719
We want you to go back into your
own time and kill Styles.
我们期望你回到你的时间, 杀了 Styles

604
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:39,399
You're asking me to commit murder!
你们要求我去实施谋杀?

605
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:43,400
No! We're asking you to kill one man
and prevent millions more dying.
不! 我们是在要求你去杀一人而救千千万万

606
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,682
- That is still murder.
- Isn't it worth it?
- 那还是谋杀  - 这样不值得吗?

607
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:48,156
- To save the human race from the Daleks?
- Yes, but would it?
- 就能从 Dalek 手中把人类救出来?   - 是的, 但能吗?

608
00:38:48,247 --> 00:38:50,078
We've told you how it happened.
我们告诉你们了, 这一切是怎么开始的

609
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:52,886
But your history could be wrong, you know.
但你们的历史可能是错的, 你知道吗?

610
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:57,643
Now, listen, why don't you
send us back to our time?
现在, 听着, 为什么你不把我们送回我们的时间?

611
00:38:57,727 --> 00:38:59,922
We know the future now,
maybe there are other things we can do?
我们现在已经知道了未来, 也许有其它事情我们可以做?

612
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,884
Monia, we're wasting valuable time!
Every minute that goes by...
Monia, 我们在浪费宝贵的时间! 每流逝一分钟...

613
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,527
Doctor, will you help us? It's our only hope.
博士, 你会帮助我们吗? 这是我们唯一的希望

614
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:08,361
I still can't believe that Sir Reginald
Styles is a ruthless murderer.
我还是无法相信 Reginald 爵士是一个冷血杀手

615
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:10,039
Yes, I agree, Jo.
是的, 我同意, Jo

616
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:12,277
Vain to the point of arrogance,
a trifle obstinate, perhaps,
自负到傲慢, 也许还有点固执

617
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,676
but basically a good man.
但基本上还是个好人

618
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:19,885
So, if it happened, how did it happen?
所以, 如果那事发生了, 是怎么发生的呢?

619
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:25,237
Any of your people still in our time zone?
你们还有人在我们的时间区域吗?

620
00:39:25,327 --> 00:39:27,841
- No.  - Well, Shura.
- 没有  - 还有 Shura

621
00:39:27,927 --> 00:39:30,999
He left just to send a message and
we never saw nor heard from him again.
他离开我们去送一个信息, 我们就再也没有看到他, 没听到他

622
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:32,406
We assumed he must be dead.
我们估计他肯定死了

623
00:39:54,147 --> 00:39:57,239
Look, please believe me,
I'm completely with you about the ends.
看, 请相信我, 我在最终目标上跟你们是完全一致的

624
00:39:57,327 --> 00:39:59,081
I only disagree as to the means.
我只是不同意中间的手段

625
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:02,401
All right. What do you want to know?
好吧, 你想知道什么?

626
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:07,523
This mission of yours to the 20th century,
what did you take with you?
你们这次到20世纪的任务, 你们都带了什么东西过去?

627
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:10,076
The usual battle gear, radio, disintegrators...
通常的战斗装备, 无线电, 分解器...

628
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:13,762
- Any sabotage equipment?
- Only a few charges of Dalekenium.
- 有什么搞破坏的设备吗  - 只有一小批 Dalekenium

629
00:40:14,327 --> 00:40:15,726
Dalekenium?
Dalekenium?﻿

630
00:40:15,807 --> 00:40:18,037
It's a highly effective type of explosive.
这是一种非常有效的炸药

631
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:20,766
We stole the formula from the Daleks.
我们从 Dalek 那里偷来的配方

632
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:23,924
- Could it destroy a house?
- What are you trying to say, Doctor?
- 它能够摧毁一栋房子吗?   - 你是想说什么, 博士?

633
00:40:25,447 --> 00:40:27,517
Well, don't you see? This has happened before!
喏, 你没明白吗? 这在以前已经发生了!

634
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:29,040
What has?
什么已经?

635
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:32,156
You went back to change history,
你们回到过去改变历史...

636
00:40:32,247 --> 00:40:34,397
but you didn't change anything,
you became a part of it.
但你们没有改变任何历史, 你们变成了它的一部分

637
00:40:34,487 --> 00:40:36,398
What are you talking about?
你是在说些什么?

638
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:39,877
If Styles didn't cause that explosion,
somebody else did.
如果不是 Styles 引发了那场爆炸, 那就是其他人干的

639
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:41,764
Well, obviously, but who...
嗯, 很显然是, 但谁...

640
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,002
Shura!
Shura!﻿

641
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:46,840
Isn't that exactly what he would have done?
这不正是他会完成的吗?

642
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:49,760
One last suicidal attempt to carry out his orders?
为了完成任务而进行最后一次自杀性尝试?

643
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:50,836
It's possible, I suppose.
这是可能的, 我觉得

644
00:40:50,927 --> 00:40:53,521
You're trapped in a temporal paradox!
你们陷入了时间悖论了!

645
00:40:54,127 --> 00:40:56,766
Styles didn't cause that explosion
and start the wars,
Styles 并没有导致那场爆炸, 也没有引发战争

646
00:40:57,927 --> 00:40:59,485
you did it yourselves!
是你们自己干的!

647
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:04,121
<i>You have failed the Daleks.</i>
<i>The Doctor has escaped.</i>
你辜负了 Dalek, 博士已经逃走了!

648
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:06,442
He will be recaptured. I swear it!
他会重新被抓住的, 我发誓!

649
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:09,325
<i>He must be found and destroyed.</i>
必须找到他, 并消灭他

650
00:41:09,407 --> 00:41:11,841
He will attempt to return to his own time zone.
他会试图回到他自己的时区

651
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:15,044
If those guerrillas are helping him,
they will use the tunnel
如果游击队在帮他, 他们会使用隧道的

652
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:16,880
and I am setting up an ambush.
而我就设定一次伏击

653
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:20,801
<i>If you fail us again,</i>
<i>you will pay with your life.</i>
如果你再次失败, 你将付出你的生命作为代价

654
00:41:20,887 --> 00:41:23,037
<i>This is your final chance.</i>
这是你最后的机会

655
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:27,047
I will go and supervise the operations myself.
我将动身, 亲自监督此次行动

656
00:41:35,407 --> 00:41:37,363
Is everything ready?
都准备好了吗?

657
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:40,804
Security forces have covered the whole tunnel.
警卫队已经包围了整个隧道

658
00:41:41,287 --> 00:41:44,245
Don't worry, they won't escape a second time.
别担心, 他们不会再次逃走了

659
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:16,595
So it has ended as I said it would.
所以到头来结局跟我说过的一样

660
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,520
Did I not tell you it was madness
to fight the Daleks?
我不是告诉过你, 和 Dalek 斗争是件疯狂的事吗?

661
00:42:19,607 --> 00:42:22,963
Is it madness to want to see a world
free from their rule?
那想见到一个不受他们统治的世界, 也是疯狂的吗?

662
00:42:23,047 --> 00:42:24,878
- It can't be done.  - Oh, yes it can.
- 这不可能的  - 噢, 是的, 可能

663
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:28,764
And I can do it. Are you going to stop me?
而且我可以做到, 你打算阻止我吗?

664
00:42:34,207 --> 00:42:37,995
Go. I will deal with these criminals myself.
走, 我自己来对付这些犯罪分子

665
00:42:39,887 --> 00:42:42,321
I said go!
我说了走!

666
00:42:48,937 --> 00:42:50,768
If only I could be sure.
要是我能确定就好了

667
00:42:50,957 --> 00:42:53,107
You spoke of the war,
你说过这场战争

668
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:55,681
of its years of suffering and starvation.
多年的苦难和饥饿
