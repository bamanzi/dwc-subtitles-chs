1
00:00:01,247 --> 00:00:03,477
(DOCTOR WHO THEME)

2
00:00:38,127 --> 00:00:39,560
I still say this is no work for women.

3
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:41,046
I wouldn't have
missed this for anything.

4
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:44,164
Anyway, I'm the only one
who knows what the Doctor looks like.

5
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:45,965
Come on. This way.

6
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:54,163
Ah, now, these are more to my taste
than your iron man, Linx.

7
00:00:54,247 --> 00:00:57,159
I will still perfect a fighting robot
for your army, Irongron.

8
00:00:57,247 --> 00:00:59,044
We'll take these weapons
to the men, Bloodaxe,

9
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:01,721
and I shall instruct them in their use.

10
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:05,686
Tomorrow morning, at dawn,
we march on Sir Edward's castle.

11
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:07,405
Yes, Captain.

12
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:10,160
By sunset he'll be feeding the crows.

13
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:15,319
Ah! Good evening!

14
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:20,805
Get after him! Call the guards!

15
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:22,878
(SHOUTING)

16
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:34,038
-Look, they try to kill their wizard.
-Quick, we need him alive!

17
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:37,164
(YELLING)

18
00:01:39,327 --> 00:01:42,125
He who strikes Irongron dies!

19
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:49,600
Doctor! Up here!

20
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:15,158
Thank you very much, Miss Smith.
A most timely rescue.

21
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:17,442
This isn't a rescue, Doctor,
it's a capture.

22
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:19,119
Let's get him out of here.

23
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:58,486
That fellow has the gall of a camel
and the cunning of a fox!

24
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:02,321
You shall have your revenge, Captain.
He'll be with Sir Edward now.

25
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:04,875
And not even a rat will come out
of that castle alive tomorrow.

26
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:07,925
By the stars, Bloodaxe,
I swear I'll chop him up so fine

27
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:11,238
not even a sparrow
will fill its beak at one peck!

28
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:16,127
One of my workers has disappeared.

29
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:17,879
Order a search of your castle.

30
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:20,481
If you've lost one of your dumb,
whey-faced ninnies, Linx,

31
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,285
then look for him yourself.

32
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:25,279
-My men are at rest.
-We march on Sir Edward within the hour.

33
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:30,316
I insist upon a search, Irongron.
The Doctor is of great value to me.

34
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:32,716
And while he is at large,
he could be dangerous.

35
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:33,842
The Doctor?

36
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:38,079
Bother me now, little toad,
and you will feel an axe in your skull!

37
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:42,962
Master, I heard someone call ''Doctor''
while we were at that fellow's heels.

38
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:46,517
Is this Doctor a long shank rascal
with a mighty nose?

39
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:48,723
That is how he would appear
in human eyes.

40
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,877
Then he is no longer here.

41
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:54,326
Sir Edward sent raiders to my castle,
captured him.

42
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:56,045
He has escaped!

43
00:03:56,647 --> 00:03:58,842
-Tell Sir Edward we're back.
-Yes.

44
00:03:58,927 --> 00:04:01,805
-Now...
-You've been getting around, Sarah.

45
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:04,560
Are you on visiting terms
with all the local nobility?

46
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:07,525
Doctor, let's get
a few things straight, shall we?

47
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,605
Oh, dear. I'm afraid
you're going to be awfully confused

48
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:12,996
if you ask me to explain about
the Tardis.

49
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,681
-The Tardis?
-Yes, my police box.

50
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,598
You were a stowaway, I imagine.

51
00:04:17,687 --> 00:04:19,757
Yes, but we'll come to that later.

52
00:04:19,847 --> 00:04:24,363
-Now then, why are you helping Irongron?
-My dear girl, I'm not helping him.

53
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:27,555
Linx is. I'm trying to stop him.

54
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:28,875
SARAH: Linx?

55
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:31,640
Yes, perhaps you're lucky enough
not to have met him yet.

56
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:34,685
Nasty, brutish and short
just about sums him up.

57
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,001
There was a strange-looking knight
with Irongron.

58
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:41,602
Yes, he'd have looked even stranger
if he hadn't been wearing space armour.

59
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:42,722
He comes from a planet

60
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:45,002
where the surface gravity
is many times that of Earth.

61
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:47,203
-A man from the stars?
-Mmm-hmm.

62
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,757
-How do I know you're telling the truth?
-Because I never lie.

63
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:52,803
Well, hardly ever.

64
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:55,998
You ever heard of UNIT?

65
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,759
You work for UNIT?

66
00:04:57,847 --> 00:05:00,156
In an advisory capacity, yes.

67
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:04,045
They asked me to look into this question
of the missing scientists for them.

68
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,640
But I thought
you were responsible for that.

69
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:08,685
My dear girl, I don't go round
kidnapping scientists!

70
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,122
No, Linx brought them here
to staff his workshop.

71
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:13,437
Now I've got to find a way
of sending them back to their own time.

72
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:17,042
-This is the magician?
-Yes. This is the Doctor.

73
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,525
You have done well, Sarah.

74
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,076
How do you do?
It is a pleasure and a privilege

75
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:25,522
to be in the company
of civilised people at last.

76
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:26,722
A courtly rogue.

77
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:28,763
Is he willing to change his allegiance

78
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:30,917
and serve Sir Edward
instead of Irongron?

79
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,918
Well, he says
he wasn't serving Irongron.

80
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:35,760
And there is another stranger
at the castle, someone called Linx.

81
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:38,042
Yes, he's your enemy, I assure you,
not me.

82
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:40,641
We'd be well advised
to join forces against him.

83
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:43,116
-Does he speak truth?
-I'm not sure.

84
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:45,084
I suppose I could have been wrong.

85
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:46,646
That's a generous admission.

86
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:48,558
Especially coming from
one of the fair sex.

87
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:51,115
Or he could just be changing sides
to save his own skin.

88
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:54,244
These wizards and warlocks
were ever a treacherous breed.

89
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:56,318
We'd best be wary of him.

90
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:58,315
I shall spare your life

91
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:02,400
if you cast your spells and incantations
to help me against Irongron, Doctor.

92
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,318
Refuse and you die.

93
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:07,961
You offer a somewhat
restricted choice, Sir Edward.

94
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:10,197
EDWARD: What is your answer?

95
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:13,686
My services are at your disposal, sir.

96
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,604
-Such as they are.
-Good.

97
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,840
Serve me straight, Doctor,
and I shall reward you well.

98
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:23,357
Oh, master... Oh, but, master,
Irongron marches here before noon!

99
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:25,165
We heard this said from his own mouth.

100
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:28,557
Then we are lost.
We cannot stand against them.

101
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:31,400
-On the contrary, sir, I think we can.
-But how? With a handful of men?

102
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:33,955
Yes, sir, with just a few men
I think I can persuade Irongron

103
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:35,560
that we have a full garrison.

104
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:38,445
By the use of your magic?

105
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:40,245
By creating an illusion, anyway.

106
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:44,320
Your magic will have to be powerful
indeed to discourage Irongron.

107
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:46,079
It will be, sir.

108
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,959
-The men are ready, Captain.
-Good.

109
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:51,878
Though for such an easy conquest
as this,

110
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:54,561
'tis scarce worth strapping on armour!

111
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,081
You and I alone, good Bloodaxe,
could take that castle!

112
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,600
Indeed we could, Captain.

113
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:00,643
With Sir Edward's treasure
I shall hire more men,

114
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:04,481
and with Linx's weapons to arm them,
who shall stand against us?

115
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:06,643
When does the fighting start, Irongron?

116
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:09,480
In the time it takes to ride
from here to Sir Edward's castle.

117
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,035
-Then I shall come with you.
-What, you?

118
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,245
Ha! Bloodaxe, on my oath,
can you see that on a scaling ladder?

119
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:19,197
I have an interest in seeing the battle.

120
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:22,006
Those eyes have a thirst for blood.

121
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:25,284
Well, find our bold warrior a horse,
Bloodaxe.

122
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:27,920
Come, then!

123
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:35,362
-Here's a few more for you, Doctor.
-Thank you, Sarah.

124
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:38,962
Lady Eleanor's got every serving wench
in the castle sewing away like mad.

125
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:41,402
I told you there'd be plenty of work
for everybody, didn't I?

126
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:43,842
Oh. Typically
masculine arrangement, though.

127
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:46,236
We do all the dirty work,
you get all the fun.

128
00:07:46,327 --> 00:07:49,763
You don't think mixing this singularly
noxious compound is fun, do you?

129
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:52,202
-How's the rest of it going?
-Not bad.

130
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:55,006
I put Sir Edward in charge
of painting the dummies' faces.

131
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:57,043
He's turned out to be quite an artist.

132
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,965
-Once I'd set him on the right lines.
-Excellent.

133
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:03,238
-I'm glad I decided to let you stay.
-You decided?

134
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:06,281
You know, I was never much of a hand
with a paint brush myself.

135
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:08,403
-No?
-No.

136
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:10,803
Nor a palette knife for that matter.

137
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:13,003
I'd like to study
under one of the masters one day.

138
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:14,884
Rembrandt, preferably.

139
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,559
-Rembrandt!
-Mmm-hmm.

140
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:19,605
Can you... Can you just go anywhere
you like in that Tardis?

141
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:20,756
Yes, within reason.

142
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:23,281
Then why are you staying here?
Why don't you go somewhere safer?

143
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:26,359
Because, my dear Sarah,
I've got a job to do.

144
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:29,245
One that involves
the whole future of your species.

145
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,997
Here, hold this will you?

146
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:33,805
-My species?
-Mmm-hmm.

147
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:36,196
You're talking as if you weren't human.

148
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:37,800
Well, the definition
of the word ''humanity''

149
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,003
was always rather
a complex question, wasn't it?

150
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:43,523
You know perfectly well what I mean.
Are you or aren't you?

151
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,598
If you mean
am I a native of the planet Terra,

152
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:47,120
the answer is no, I'm not.

153
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:49,516
-Well, what are you, then?
-Me? I'm a Time Lord.

154
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:52,686
-A Time Lord?
-Yes, that's right.

155
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:56,521
And my people are very keen
to stamp out unlicensed time travel.

156
00:08:56,807 --> 00:09:00,880
You can look upon them as
galactic ticket inspectors if you like.

157
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:03,435
-Galactic ticket inspectors?
-Mmm-hmm.

158
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:07,881
I could murder a cup of tea.
You're serious, aren't you?

159
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:11,403
About what I do, yes.
Not necessarily the way I do it.

160
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,281
-For example, you know what this is?
-I've no idea.

161
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:16,557
This is my own special smoking mixture,

162
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:19,161
consisting of saltpetre,
sulphur and fat.

163
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:20,885
With a few little extras thrown in.

164
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:22,195
(TRUMPET SOUNDING)

165
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:25,563
Ah! That is Irongron.
Battle is about to commence!

166
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:42,926
We've been tricked, Bloodaxe.
That dog of a prisoner swore

167
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:45,237
that Edward had but a few old men
to guard his castle!

168
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:47,363
My Lord of Salisbury
must have sent him help.

169
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:50,086
The messenger to Lord Salisbury
died in our dungeons.

170
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,123
These cannot be Salisbury's men.

171
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,084
Why do you wait?

172
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,439
What will be
your first method of attack?

173
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:59,518
We don't attack. We return to my castle.

174
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:01,598
You fear to fight?

175
00:10:01,687 --> 00:10:03,678
The greater the odds,
the greater the glory.

176
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:06,281
I fear nothing, toad face!

177
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:09,760
But there is little profit
in butchered for naught.

178
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:13,041
Sir Edward holds his walls
with too strong a force.

179
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:15,083
Then use your rifles,
shoot them from the walls.

180
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,000
-Rifles?
-The weapons that I made for you.

181
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:19,998
-Ah!
-They're at the range.

182
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:24,205
On my oath, Linx, when I am king,
you shall be my champion!

183
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,845
That's made them stop and think, anyway.

184
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,997
I thought Linx would have to come along.

185
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:41,681
Sontarans just can't resist
getting involved in war.

186
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,122
This must be very minor league
stuff to him, surely?

187
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:45,401
He's just like a little boy,

188
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:47,557
stirring up the red ants
and the black ants.

189
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,957
It's just something to keep him amused,
to stop him from getting bored.

190
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,801
They've got guns!

191
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:56,721
No man has fallen, Captain!

192
00:10:56,807 --> 00:11:00,846
-Your weapons do not work, Linx!
-You do not shoot them straight!

193
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,406
Watch.

194
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:13,003
-LINX: Those figures are dummies.
-Bah, your weapons are useless!

195
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:17,046
They do not move nor fall.
They are not living men.

196
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:20,605
IRONGRON: I smell that fox of a Doctor
behind this.

197
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:24,117
Bring up the scaling ladders!

198
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:28,280
Here they come, Doctor!

199
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,764
(MEN YELLING)

200
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:38,846
Away! Away!

201
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:41,957
Come on, move it!

202
00:12:47,287 --> 00:12:50,279
Well, I think we'd better
get back inside before that smoke rises.

203
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:52,278
It's liable to hang around
for quite some time.

204
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:55,837
What was that stuff, Doctor?
Some kind of gas?

205
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:57,201
Gas?

206
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:59,642
Good heavens,
what on earth do you take me for?

207
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:01,683
No, it was some sort of
superior stink bomb

208
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:04,486
with a few bangs and flashes
thrown in for good measure.

209
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:06,956
It's quite harmless,
I assure you, but...

210
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,719
(SNIFFING)

211
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:13,165
(MEN COUGHING)

212
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,797
Bring me wine! Wine, I say!

213
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:19,766
To quench the dust from my throat
and the stench from my nostrils.

214
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,758
More, wench, more!

215
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:27,237
Am I a sparrow to quench my thirst
with a few scant drops?

216
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:30,679
Ooh, mice!

217
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:36,758
A few loud noises, a few bad smells
and you scatter like sheep!

218
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:38,878
It was sorcery, master.

219
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,242
Black devil's work.
You said so yourself.

220
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:43,636
This wizard, the Doctor,
he's gone and joined Sir Edward,

221
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:46,844
and he threw all the fires
and the stenches of hell itself at us!

222
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,485
With poltroons like these,

223
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,956
it were ill work
to lay siege to a hen coop!

224
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:54,164
They do but need food and rest
to recover their spirits, Captain.

225
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:56,158
We attack again tomorrow morning.

226
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:57,805
I will take Sir Edward's castle

227
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,197
or I will see every man of you
perish in the attempt!

228
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:04,043
Chicken-hearted knaves!

229
00:14:04,607 --> 00:14:06,484
Begone from my sight!

230
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:15,200
Did I not see you yourself
leading their retreat, Captain?

231
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:19,406
Taunt me not, little toad face.

232
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:24,003
Or by the stars I'll see if the colour
of your blood is red like mortal man's.

233
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:26,555
You Earth creatures give up too easily.

234
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:29,844
I doubt if you have the potential
to make a truly military species.

235
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:33,397
And you, Linx, you claim to like war.

236
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:37,605
-I haven't seen you doing much this day.
-I came only to observe.

237
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:40,478
I should have known better
than to look for interest

238
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,125
in a struggle of primitives.

239
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:45,045
Threaten me once more
and I will destroy you.

240
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:46,719
Why, you...

241
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:52,963
Primitives!
Childish, squabbling primitives!

242
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:57,966
It is well I do not need
to spend much more time among you.

243
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,685

EDWARD: More wine, Doctor?

245
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,485
No, thank you, no.
Oh, well, just perhaps a little.

246
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:20,923
Those knaves of Irongron's,
they ran like rabbits!

247
00:15:23,327 --> 00:15:27,366
Finest sight that ever I saw, Doctor.
And all thanks to you and your wizardry.

248
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:29,403
Well, we all played our part,
Sir Edward.

249
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:32,126
Now your magic works for us,
our troubles are over.

250
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:33,322
No, not quite, I'm afraid.

251
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:36,001
The Doctor thinks Irongron's
bound to attack again.

252
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:38,806
And you shall affright the knaves
with more of your sorceries.

253
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,764
It won't work indefinitely, I fear.

254
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:42,519
This time
we had the element of surprise.

255
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:45,041
They won't be frightened off
quite so easily again.

256
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:48,005
Then we've gained a respite. No more.

257
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:50,157
Actually, the Doctor
does have another idea.

258
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:54,081
Then let us hear your counsel, Doctor.
So far you have served us well.

259
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:57,443
Well, there's one sure way to prevent
Irongron from capturing your castle.

260
00:15:57,527 --> 00:15:59,245
And that is?

261
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:00,601
You must capture his.

262
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:01,881
(SCOFFS)

263
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:04,959
You advise the impossible, Doctor.
They outnumber us so greatly.

264
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,517
My lady, are you familiar
with these herbs and simples?

265
00:16:09,527 --> 00:16:12,917
Ragwort, henbane, love-in-a-mist,
fennel, sesame.

266
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:16,283
Most we have dried in the kitchens.
The rest grow in the woods nearby.

267
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:18,927
Excellent.
I want to brew up a little draught.

268
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:22,363
You mean to mix a magic potion
to slay the dog?

269
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:25,996
No, not quite. Just something
to calm him down a little.

270
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:30,921
I should have slain
the filthy little toad there and then.

271
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:33,919
I should have carved him up
into callops on the spot.

272
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:37,158
Aye, master, it puzzles me
as to why you did not.

273
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:42,965
Aye, well 'tis a matter
of high policy, do you see?

274
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:46,639
Above your understanding, hmm?

275
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:52,002
As yet, we still need Linx's aid.

276
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:58,165
Weapons he has promised me
and by the stars, weapons I shall have.

Wonderful, magical weapons,

278
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:05,520
that will crumble the castles
of those that oppose me into dust.

00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:11,885
And then, and only then,
shall Linx die by my hand!

Hold, Friar.
What business have you here?

287
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:43,198
We come to beg alms
of the good Captain Irongron.

288
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:46,364
The fame of his charity
is spread far and wide.

289

You will find Captain Irongron
in the great hall.

290
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:52,036
He is indeed a kindly and charitable man

291
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,641
and his temper
is most sweet and pleasant.

292
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,801
Pass, Friar.

293
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:59,481

What's that?

That's a Sontaran spaceship,

and tremendously powerful for its size,
just like its owner.

-Deep hypnosis.

Ah, there you are, Doctor!
Back again, eh?

-SARAH: Professor Rubeish!
-What?

Oh, it's you!

307
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:14,878
Doctor, I knew this girl was involved.
We should have reported her as I wanted.

308
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:17,401
Yes, well, I'm very glad we didn't.

309
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:19,443
In a few hours, that ship's
going to be ready for takeoff.

310
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:23,805
Yes, he's been working these people
at a killing pace. Come over here.

311
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:25,396
Look.

312
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:29,321
No sleep. Practically no food.
They're starting to collapse like flies.

313
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,398
I'm not surprised.
He's suffering from near starvation.

314
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:34,001
We'll have to get them
some food, Doctor, or at least a drink.

315
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:36,043
-There's no time for that.
-They'll die if we don't.

316
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:37,879
Sarah, listen to me.

317
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:41,519
Linx's spaceship
is just about ready for takeoff.

318
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:44,679
And when that happens, there's going
to be the most tremendous explosion.

319
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,758
Everybody in this castle will die.

320
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,001
These are the weapons
I have promised you.

321
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:54,318
Also a good supply
of the projectiles that they use.

322
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:58,923
Oh, my thanks, good toad face...
Good Linx.

323
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:02,364
More weapons from the stars.

324
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:05,757
I shall complete the repairs
of the improved fighting robot

325
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:07,519
if I have time before I leave.

326
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,405
If you wish to leave,
then you would do well to obey me.

327
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:12,955
Do you threaten me?

328
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:15,322
I leave when I am ready,
and that will be soon.

329
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:19,002
And will you carry your starship
on your back, good toad?

330
00:20:19,407 --> 00:20:23,605
You needed my knaves to bring it here,
you will need them to take it hence.

331
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:25,564
Evidently you have no understanding

332
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:28,207
of the forces involved
in interstellar travel.

333
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:30,526
I shall leave when I am ready.

334
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:33,724
It would be foolish of you
to attempt to stop me.

335
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:40,319
Doctor, what are you doing?

336
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,637
-Trying to break this hypnosis.
-It's very deep.

337
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:44,558
Narcoleptic condition, eh?

338
00:20:44,647 --> 00:20:47,719
The brain can still receive signals,
Professor. It might work.

339
00:20:47,807 --> 00:20:49,843
Even if it does,
can't see what you intend.

340
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:51,838
Don't you want to get back
to the 20th century?

341
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:55,442
Steak and mushrooms, lobster,
chocolate truffles, oh, dear me, yes.

342
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:57,882
If I can get these people to respond,

343
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:01,084
I can send them back to their own time
with Linx's osmic projector.

344
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,202
Osmic projector?

345
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:05,085
Yes, it's over there on the table.
Take a look.

346
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:08,239
Why can't you just send them
as they are?

347
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:10,363
It's too risky
with their minds in this state.

348
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:12,165
The transition
might damage them permanently.

349
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:13,999
I've never heard
so much gobbledegook in me life.

350
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:15,725
But I expect
you know what you're talking about.

351
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,035
-Polka time!
-BOTH: What?

352
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:20,483
It's the beat.
Look, he's beginning to respond.

353
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:22,246
Hide!

354
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,601
Up!

355
00:21:38,407 --> 00:21:40,204
Get back to work!

356
00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:46,202
Work! What's wrong with you?

357
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,479
Get up or I will kill you!

358
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:51,637
-Leave him, Linx!
-Ah!

359
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:55,685
How fortunate
that you have returned, Doctor.

360
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:57,086
My failure to destroy you

361
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:59,044
was the one thing
that marred the pleasure

362
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:02,199
of my approaching departure
from this miserable planet.

363
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,925
Don't you want to know
why I've returned?

364
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:05,520
It is of no interest to me.

365
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:07,245
I came here to offer you my help.

366
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,557
We're sworn enemies, Doctor.
Why should you help me?

367
00:22:09,647 --> 00:22:11,797
Because I want something from you.

368
00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:15,684
If you will let me de-hypnotise people
and send them home

369
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,725
and help me
capture Irongron and his men,

370
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:22,277
then I will assist you
in the repairs to your spaceship.

371
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:23,880
Now, the weapons
that you've made for Irongron

372
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,764
you can leave here in the castle.

373
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,360
When it's empty, you can take off,

374
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:30,484
destroying castle and weapons
at the same time.

375
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:31,886
All right, Commander Linx,

376
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:34,160
what do you say?

377
00:22:34,246 --> 00:22:37,158
-You wish for my answer, Doctor?
-I do.

378
00:22:37,646 --> 00:22:39,238
Then here it is.
