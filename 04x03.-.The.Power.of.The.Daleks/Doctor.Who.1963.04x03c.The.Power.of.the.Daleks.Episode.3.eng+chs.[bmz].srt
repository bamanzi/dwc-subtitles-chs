我是-你的-仆人. 我是-你的-仆人...
I am your servant. I am your servant...

7
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:50,318
Lesterson, 它们居然可以说话!
So Lesterson, they're even capable of speech!

8
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,670
是的. 为什么不呢? 毕竟, 他们有一定的智力.
Yes. But then, why not? After all, they have a certain intelligence.

9
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:56,735
是的我知道, 但是...
Yes I know, but...

10
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,541
但是, 是不是... 我们可以控制住.
But is... is it... it is... an intelligence that we can control.

11
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:03,922
你想的无非就是获准可以继续你的实验?
So what you want is permission to continue your experiments?

12
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:08,900
总督, 想想这意味着什么, 我们可以让他们去挖矿. 我们的生产力可以翻番了!
Governor, think what it would mean if we were to set it to work
in the mines. It could double our production overnight!

13
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,095
想想这可能给我们整体经济带来什么效果.
Consider the effects it could have on our whole economy.

14
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:22,457
是的, 还可以地球地球带来... 是的, 是的, 他们会很感激的.
Yes, and the effect of that on Earth...
Yes. Yes, they could be very grateful.

15
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:26,278
我该阻止你. 我会的!
I shall stop you. I will!

16
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,905
好了 Lesterson, 授权你可以继续.
All right Lesterson, permission granted.

17
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:32,255
授权? 授什么权?
Permission? Permission for what?

18
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:34,261
继续我的工作啊, 监察员.
To continue my work, Examiner.

19
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:39,193
但是... 但是你没听见我说什么了吗? Daleks必须全部毁掉!
But... But didn't you all hear what I said?
The Daleks must be destroyed!

20
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,995
吼, 吼. 绝不!
Ho, ho. Never!

21
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:45,597
很好. 如果我的命令不好使 - 那地球的命令总可以了! 过来 Ben, Polly.
Very well. If not by my order - then by Earth's! Come Ben, Polly.

22
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:52,752
啊, 监察员. 等一下. 告诉我, 你为什么如此针对这个项目?
Ah, Examiner. Just a moment.
Tell me, why are you so against this project?

23
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:57,946
我告诉过你! 我意识到我无法给你任何证据, 但你们大难临头还一无所知!
But I've told you! I realise I can't give you any proof,
but you've no idea of the danger!

24
00:01:58,126 --> 00:01:58,733
不会.
No.

25
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:06,479
是的, 大难! 只要通讯一恢复我就要联系地球.
Yes. Danger! I shall be contacting Earth just as soon as
radio communications have been restored.

26
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:11,483
你是我的仆人, 是吗?
You're my servant, are you?

27
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:13,186
我... 是.
I... I am.

28
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:29,070
很好. 关掉你自己. 快. 我命令! 马上!
Very well. Immobilise yourself. Go on. I order it! Immediately!

29
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:37,620
哈!
Huh!

30
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,027
Lesterson.
Lesterson.

31
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,826
你为什么不遵守? 你已经收到命令了.
Why did you stop obeying? You were given an order.

32
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,050
他-已经-走了.
He has gone.

33
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:50,898
你只遵守...
Then you obey only...

34
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:57,556
他的-命令-是-错误的. 我-要是-关掉-自己-就-不能-服务于-人了.FIXME
His order was wrong. I cannot serve human beings if I am immobilised.

35
00:02:57,797 --> 00:03:05,556
你-给了-我-能量. 你的-命令-是-对的. 我-服务于-你.
You gave me power. Your orders are right. I serve you.

36
00:03:06,482 --> 00:03:13,809
Lesterson. Lesterson, 他会分析. 你不是说它智力有限吗?
Lesterson. Lesterson, it reasons.
Just how limited is its intelligence?

37
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:18,994
喔, 没理由担心这个, 总督. 你等着瞧它能做多少事情!
Now, there is no cause for... for concern, Governor.
Just you wait until you see the amount of work it can do!

38
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:24,994
现在, 我要让你经历你自己的生活了. 跟我来, Dalek.
And now, I'm really going to put you through your paces.
Follow me, Dalek.

39
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:27,255
我-服从.
I obey.

40
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,100
居然这样!
That's it!

41
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:42,311
我们应该跟 Quinn 呆在一起.
We should have stayed with Quinn.

42
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:45,704
我们本来也帮不了他的, Polly, 即使我们想帮. 总督已经做出决定了.
Well, we couldn't have helped him Polly, even if we'd wanted to.
The Governor's already reached his verdict.

43
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:49,300
Polly: 但他没有谋杀真正的监察员. 我确定他没有.
But he didn't murder the real Examiner. I'm sure he didn't.
(博士: 电缆. 剪刀. 磁带.)
Wire. Scissors. Tape.

44
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:51,832
哦, 这样. 我看这帮人忙于内部吵来吵去, 做不了什么事情都做不成.
Oh, well. The way I see it this lot's too busy arguing
amongst themselves to do much about anything.

45
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:55,832
不管怎样, 排排重点. Daleks 是最重要的事!
Anyway, first things first. The Daleks are the important thing!

46
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:57,897
啊! 恭喜你, Ben!
Ah! Congratulations, Ben!

47
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,100
我做什么了? 我做什么了?
What'd I do? What'd I do?

48
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,629
你用了你的脑子, 你干了这个. Daleks 是最重要的事情!
You just used your brains, that's what you did.
The Daleks are the most important thing!

49
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,315
我仍然认为 Quinn 是无辜的.
I still think Quinn's innocent.

50
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:09,675
我怎么能与叛乱分子结成同盟呢?
How can I be in league with the rebels?

51
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:10,440
证据已经证实了.
The evidence confirms it.

52
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:11,991
是我提醒他们注意危险的.
It was I that warned of their dangers.

53
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:13,350
这是你总体计划的一部分!
As part of your overall plan!

54
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:14,477
你甚至都没有认真对待.
You wouldn't even take the matter seriously.

55
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:16,146
我那时错了, 现在我有机会来纠正它了!
If I was wrong then, I have a chance to rectify it now!

56
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:20,197
如果你是这个态度, 我建议我们...
If that's going to be your attitude, I suggest that we...

57
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:27,409
Quinn! 我们一件一件捋清楚. 首先, 监察员被攻击了, 这是毫无疑问的.
Quinn! Let us conduct this inquiry in an orderly manner.
Now, the Examiner was attacked, there can be no question of that.

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,216
被监察员抓到手的纽扣也是你衣服上不见的那个.
And the button grabbed by the Examiner was missing from your suit.

59
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:32,898
是的, 如果你还有什么补充, 你最好现在就说.
Yes, if you've got anything to add to that, you'd better say it now.

60
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,391
我没有袭击他. 我没有理由. 他是我请求派来的!
I didn't attack the man. I had no reason to.
I was the one that sent for him!

61
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:40,221
你请求的?!
You sent for him?!

62
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:45,516
在现在这情况下, 必须这样做。我也不可能破坏电波通讯.
It was necessary. Under the circumstances,
I'd hardly be likely to sabotage the radio communications.

63
00:04:46,376 --> 00:04:48,040
不过... 为什么 Quinn? 为什么?
But... but why Quinn? Why?

64
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:49,525
因为那些叛乱分子!
Because of the rebels!

65
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:52,252
叛乱分子! 只不过有一两个狂热分子.
The rebels! They're nothing more than one or two fanatics.

66
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:53,456
你我都知道他们...
You know as well as I do that they...

67
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:57,672
除非你是想制造些事端 - 想挖总督的墙脚吧.
Unless you're trying to create trouble here
- to undermine the Governor's position.

68
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:01,266
Bragen, 你最好解释一下.
Bragen, you'd better explain that.

69
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:08,680
如果你被除掉了, 谁顶你的位子? 当然是副总督. 这就是所有问题的真正原因, 对吧 Quinn?
If you're removed, who takes your place? The Deputy Governor, of course.
And that's the real reason behind all this trouble, isn't it Quinn?

70
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:09,526
继续.
Go on.

71
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:15,313
你在水银沼泽袭击了监察员, 嫁祸于叛乱分子. 然后又破坏了电台 - 也归咎于叛乱分子.
You attack the Examiner in the mercury swamp and blame it on the rebels.
Then you sabotage the radio - blame that on the rebels too.

72
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:17,852
把他带走!
Get him out of my sight!

73
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:20,964
Hensell, 在你听取这些荒谬的指控之前...
Hensell, before you listen to these preposterous allegations...

74
00:05:27,438 --> 00:05:34,467
Quinn 是我自己选的. 我培养他干这个工作. 为什么啊, 要不了几年时间, 他就能坐在这个位子上了啊!
I chose Quinn myself. I trained him for the job.
Why, in a few years time, he'd have had this seat!

75
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:37,827
总督, 有时候, 几年时间也嫌太长, 等不了啊.
Sometimes Governor, a few years is a long time to wait.

76
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:42,897
哦, Bragen?
Oh, Bragen?

77
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:44,031
总督?
Governor?

78
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:51,673
你接替 Quinn 的工作. 目前来说, 你是副总督.
You will assume Quinn's duties. As of now, you are Deputy Governor.

79
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,513
啊!
Ah!

80
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:02,397
我希望你知道自己在做什么!
I hope you know what you're doing!

81
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:03,828
我也是!
So do I!

82
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:17,858
非常好. 非常好.
Excellent. excellent.

83
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,967
我还以为我们在追查的是 Daleks, 而不是你在玩弄的这个控制盒!
But I thought we were after the Daleks,
not this control unit you've nicked!

84
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,078
要是我们能找到一个... 啊, 对了!
If only we could find a... Ah, yes!

85
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:32,327
他对这事不怎么上心, 是不?
He's a right little delinquent, isn't he?

86
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:34,857
博士, 你到底在干什么?
Doctor, what on Earth are you up to?

87
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:36,623
哦!
Ooh!

88
00:06:38,242 --> 00:06:40,126
啊! 我们真有点进展了!
Ah! Now we're really getting somewhere!

89
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,581
看着, 博士, 我并不想看起来比较负能量, 但这跟 Daleks 有什么关系?
Look Doctor, I don't want to appear dim,
but how's this going to do the Daleks in?

90
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,597
他们认为是 Lesterson 有主导权, 但我觉得不是. Daleks 在利用他.
They think that Lesterson's the driving force,
but I don't. The Daleks are using him.

91
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:51,831
那怎么办?
But how?

92
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:56,113
有个问题. 砸碎 Daleks 的话, 这里的人会把我们锁起来或者干脆干掉我们 FIXME
Problem. Smash the Daleks, and the people here will lock us up or kill us.

93
00:06:56,372 --> 00:07:01,113
任由 Daleks 乱来的话, 我们会被 exterminated（终结）.
Let the Daleks go, and we'll all be exterminated.

94
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:04,844
我们可以回 TARDIS 去. 至少在那里是安全的.
We could just go back to the TARDIS.
At least we'd be safe to think there.

95
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:06,789
哦, 是的, that's coming on.
Oh yes, that's coming on.

96
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:09,756
哦, 你会跟他说的, 是吗?
Oh, you talk to him, will you?

97
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:12,904
博士, 如果你告诉我们你要干什么的话, 也许我们能帮上忙.
Doctor look, if you told us what you were up to,
perhaps we could help you.

98
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:18,549
千万不能低估他们中的任何一个. Lesterson 是个一流的科学家, 一流的FIXME
Mustn't underestimate any of them.
Lesterson's a first class scientist, first class.

99
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:23,549
他打开了舱体, 还发现 Daleks 可以被重新激活.
He opened the capsule. He realised that the Daleks could be reactivated.

100
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:29,947
是, 那可能就是答案. 我们不如把 Lesterson 绑架了吧, 把他藏起来一阵子 FIXME
Yeah, that could be the answer. Let's kidnap Lesterson,
and hide him away for a bit.

101
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:31,647
这样就可以阻止他救活那些 Daleks, 对吧?
Well, it would stop him bringing the Daleks back to life, wouldn't it?

102
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:34,661
我觉得这个主意真不错.
I thought it was pretty bright.

103
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:36,034
这下可以了.
There we are.

104
00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:37,691
什么?
What is it?

105
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,571
这是什么东西? 可能是我们所有问题的答案.
What is it? It could be the answer to all our problems.

106
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,778
监察员, 别让他们用叛乱的事情把你糊弄了. 他们势力强大.
Ah Examiner, don't let them fool you about the rebels.
They're strong.

107
00:07:55,179 --> 00:07:56,932
找出他们在哪里开会.
Try and find out where they hold their meetings.

108
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,230
放开他!
Leave him alone!

109
00:07:58,673 --> 00:07:59,311
没事的, Polly.
It's all right, Polly.

110
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,504
我们会帮助他, Polly. 不过得晚点.
We'll help him Polly, but later.

111
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:02,983
虽然说...
Yes but...

112
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:06,679
现在这个场景下, 一点点的不公是好过所有人都遭殃的 FIXME
Now, this is a case where a little injustice
is better than wholesale slaughter.

113
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:10,679
我们想要的东西在 Lesterson 的实验室里. 来吧.
What we want is in Lesterson's laboratory. Come along.

114
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:16,822
难以置信! 好, 下面我们进行第14项测试.
Incredible! Well, let's move on to test fourteen.

115
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:18,809
我-准备-好了.
I am ready.

116
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:24,316
把钠与酒精掺在一起, 会产生什么后果?
When sodium acts on ethyl alcohol,
what is the resulting derivative?

117
00:08:24,826 --> 00:08:30,819
乙醇-钠. C2-H5-ONa.
Sodium ethoxide. C2 H5 ONA.

118
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:35,666
只需要5秒, Janley! 而且这点时间都用来念答案了.
Just five seconds, Janley! Just the time it took to speak the answer.

119
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,694
又答对了.
Right too.

120
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,623
当然是对的! 你能想象这个机器人用的是哪种正子脑吗, Janley?
But of course it's right! Look, can you imagine
what kind of positronic brain this robot has, Janley?

121
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,623
想想他得存有多少知识. 硫酸.
Think of the store of knowledge that it must carry. Sulphuric acid.

122
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:51,287
H2 SO4.
H2 SO4.

123
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:53,302
啊, 你看?
Ah, you see?

124
00:08:53,577 --> 00:08:54,695
我可以进来吗?
May I come in?

125
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,883
你想干什么?
What do you want?

126
00:08:56,113 --> 00:08:58,451
哦, 只是来看看你这里进展如何.
Oh, ah, just to see how you're getting on.

127
00:08:58,793 --> 00:08:59,395
如果你想要...
If you think...

128
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:04,303
不, 别这样! 我... 不是来找麻烦的. ... 我只是很有兴趣, 仅此而已.
No, please! I'm... I'm not here to cause trouble.
I... I'm just interested, that's all.

129
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,062
自你达到 Vulcan 以来, 除了干扰和干涉之外什么也没做过.
You've done nothing but meddle and interfere ever
since you landed on Vulcan.

130
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:13,407
这个... 是我给了权限打开舱体, 是吧? 现在请继续.
Well, I... I did give you permission to open up the capsule,
now didn't I? Please, carry on.

131
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:15,977
你不打算阻止我?
And you won't try to stop me?

132
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:21,399
阻止你? 不, 当然不. 咱们俩一开始就不怎么对付, Lesterson,
Stop you? No, of course not. We get off on the wrong foot, Lesterson

133
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:26,399
不过... 我是一个讲理的人... 我在想, 也许是我太鲁莽了.
but... but I'm a reasonable man and...
and I've been thinking, perhaps I was hasty.

134
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:29,817
好吧, 如果... 如果你真想要休战.
Well, if you... if you... if you really want to call a truce.

135
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:33,324
休战? 亲爱的家伙, ... 我期望可以成为朋友!
A truce? My dear fellow, I... I'd like to be friends!

136
00:09:33,863 --> 00:09:37,769
好. 好. 很好, 你可以呆着.
Yes. Yes. Very well, you may stay.

137
00:09:38,086 --> 00:09:44,661
哦, 谢谢你. 谢谢你. 也许你想自己娱乐一小会儿
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Perhaps you'd like to
amuse yourselves for a little while.

138
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:51,799
这里是实验室. 是.
Laboratory. Yes.

139
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,611
好的, 我可以过来. 好.
All right, I can come now. Right.

140
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:07,755
我得出去几分钟, Lesterson, 可以吧?
I just have to slip out for a few minutes, Lesterson, alright?

141
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,401
啊, 可以, 可以. 唔, 那么, 监察员, 我们开始测试一下他的物理知识?
Ah, yes, yes. Um, very well then.
Examiner, shall we test its knowledge of physics?

142
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:15,751
哦, 太好了, 啊, 请开始吧.
Oh, oh, splendid, splendid. Ah, huh, please, please, carry on.

143
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,851
谢谢你... 热力学第一定律是什么?
Thank you. D... what is the First Law of Thermodynamics?

144
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:31,302
当-热能-转换成-其它-能, 或者-反过来, 能量-总和-保持-不变.
When heat is transformed into any other kind of energy or vice versa,
the total quantity of energy remains invariable.

145
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:44,302
也-就是-说, 消失的-热能-和-新产生的-其它-类型的-能-在量上-是-相同的...
That is to say, the quantity of heat which disappears
is equivalent to the quantity of other kind of energy produced...

146
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,570
笨蛋! 你以为你在干什么?
Fool! What do you think you're doing?

147
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:47,435
我在救你的命!
I'm saving your life!

148
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:48,508
出去! 出去!
Get out! Get out!

149
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:50,535

150
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:57,091
啊!... 啊!... 啊!... 我-扛住-了, 啊, 没有-受损.
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... I have, ah, sustained no damage.

151
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:06,425
It's all right to _?FIXME

152
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:10,075
你甩开他们了?
You were able to get away then?

153
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:13,109
是的. Lesterson 和监察员在一起. Hensell 呢?
Yes. Lesterson's with the Examiner. And Hensell?

154
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:16,191
在和产品经理们开会. 现在我说了算.
At a meeting of production managers. He left me in control.

155
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:19,109
现在我们可以接管这个基地了.
We could take over the colony now.

156
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:25,904
不. 必须做到万无一失. 我可不想接管一个满是叛乱分子的基地, Janley?
No. No it has to be absolutely right.
I don't want to take over a colony full of rebels do I, Janley?

157
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,572
我也不清楚. 是你让我帮助他们.
Well, I don't know. You're making me help them.

158
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:34,626
把他们搅乱, 多制造些问题, 就可以把 Hensell 搞下去了. 然后我们再镇压他们.
Only to stir them up to create enough trouble to get rid of Hensell,
and then... and then we crush them.

159
00:11:34,883 --> 00:11:39,626
这样我们就是基地的功臣, 我就是总督了.
The whole colony will be grateful, and I'll be Governor.

160
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:43,514
这就是你跟我说过的那种枪?
Is that the gun you told me of?

161
00:11:44,595 --> 00:11:46,319
你能说服那些叛乱分子, 说这对他们很有用吗?
Can you persuade the rebels this will help them?

162
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:49,520
是的, Valmar 认为他可以做一个开关.
Yes, Valmar thinks he can work in a switch to turn it on and off.

163
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:50,912
这有多厉害?
How powerful is it?

164
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:58,061
它杀死了 Resno, Lesterson 的助手. Lesterson 还以为 Resno 只是晕倒了, 需要休息几天而已.
It killed Resno, Lesterson's assistant, and Lesterson believes
that Resno's simply shaken up - taking a few days off.

165
00:11:58,422 --> 00:11:59,247
尸体呢?
And the body?

166
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:05,741
扔进水银沼泽了. 其实是 Lesterson 害死了他.
In the mercury swamp. Lesterson was the indirect cause of Resno's death.

167
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:13,141
这是个不错的把柄, 不怕他不听话了. 那我把这个交给 Valmar 去了?
It's a good hold over him if he makes trouble.
I'll give this to Valmar then?

168
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:14,178
好.
Yes.

169
00:12:14,671 --> 00:12:15,720
我们什么时候行动?
When do we move?

170
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:19,752
我手里还缺一张牌. 那个监察员让我不放心.
I need another card in my hand. The Examiner bothers me.

171
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:21,490
我以为 Quinn 才是危险.
I thought Quinn was the danger.

172
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:28,325
哦, 不再是了. 那个监察员不是傻子. 不对, 这里还得搞点事儿.
Uh, not any more. The Examiner is no fool.
No, there has to be something else.

173
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:34,225
哦?
Well?

174
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:36,822
他不在实验室里, 只有 Lesterson 一个人.
Well, he's not in the laboratory, Lesterson's by himself.

175
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,539
嗯. 他肯定从别的路走了. 把你一个人留在这里行吗? 我打算回休息室去.
Hmm. He must have gone another way. Can I leave it you?
I'm going to go back to the rest room.

176
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:41,430
不过...
Well, but...

177
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,041
总有人得把它打扫一下吧.
Well, somebody's got to clear it up.

178
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:43,956
好吧.
Okay.

179
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,385
哈罗.
Hello there.

180
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:55,350
哈喽. 唔, 你是 Lesterson 的助手吧?
Hello. Um, you're Lesterson's assistant aren't you?

181
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:57,756
是的. 你不是在找监察员吧?
Yes. You're not looking for the Examiner are you?

182
00:12:58,138 --> 00:12:59,543
那, 你知道他在哪儿吗?
Well, do you know where he is?

183
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:03,157
他在等一条地球来的消息, 他在通讯室.
Yes, he's waiting to get a message through from Earth.
He's in the Communications Room.

184
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:04,481
唔...
Umm...

185
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,156
哦, 你会发现很简单的.  拐过去, 在你的右手边, 下一个区就是.
Oh, you'll find it easy enough. Look.
Around, then to your right, in the next block.

186
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,116
太感谢了.
Thanks very much.

187
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:21,809
博士? 这里有人吗?
Doctor? Anyone here?

188
00:13:27,635 --> 00:13:33,850
干得好 Valmar. 按住. 按住.
Well done Valmar. Hold her. Hold her.

189
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:39,656
好了, 这能让她安静一会儿了.
There, that'll keep her quiet for a bit.

190
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:42,172
我不知道她是谁. 她在这里探头探脑的.
I've no idea who she is. She was just snooping around.

191
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:46,229
我让她过来的. 我们期望她别碍我们的事. 叫一两个你的人把她弄到一个安全的地方.
I sent her. We want her kept out of the way.
Get a couple of your men to keep her in a safe place.

192
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:49,248
这是我跟你说过的东西.
Now, this is what I told you about.

193
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:53,236
是的. 致命能量应该是从这里出来的.
Yes. The lethal power must come from here.

194
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,241
哦.
Uh, huh.

195
00:13:54,512 --> 00:13:56,024
它的射程应该也很不错.
It should have quite a good range.

196
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:57,344
你能修好它吗?
Can you fix it?

197
00:13:57,578 --> 00:14:01,155
很简单. 这东西可以帮我们赢得这场革命.
It's easy. This could win us the revolution.

198
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:02,314
啊...
Ahh...

199
00:14:18,298 --> 00:14:24,710
她说了她回这里来的. 她认识路, 也不会乱转, 我知道她不会的. 噢!
She said she was coming back here. She knew the way,
and she wouldn't have wandered off. I know she wouldn't! Oh!

200
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:30,718
Ben, 如果你是一个 Dalek 你下一步要做什么?
Ben, if you were a Dalek what would be your next move?

201
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,529
我说的是 Polly.
I'm talking about Polly.

202
00:14:32,874 --> 00:14:35,483
哦, 不不不. 她是个聪明的女孩儿, 但她回答不了这个.
Oh, no, no, no, no. She's a clever girl, but she couldn't answer this.

203
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:36,856
她失踪了!
But she is missing!

204
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,183
哦, 不不不.
Oh, no, no, no.

205
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:39,654
哦, 是是是是!
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!

206
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:46,012
不不不! 她四处逛逛而已, 这里有好多东西可以看. 她对这些很感兴趣. 我喜欢这一点.
No, no, no! She's looking around, there's a lot to see in the colony.
She's interested. I like that.

207
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:49,839
来吧.
Come on.

208
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,131
我们要去哪儿?
Where are we going?

209
00:14:51,363 --> 00:14:53,887
去报告. 如果我们要傻等, 我可不想! 我们去报告!
To report it. If we make a fool of ourselves,
I don't care! We report it!

210
00:14:56,871 --> 00:15:01,110
还好. 我总算及时阻止了那个傻蛋监察员.
Yes, yes, yes. I managed to stop that fool of an Examiner just in time.
You know there are some people here who believe that you're an enemy.

211
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:07,610
你知道这里的一些人会认为你是我们的敌人.

212
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,793
我-是-你的-仆人.
I am your servant.

213
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:18,371
这台-机器-是做-什么-的?
What does this machine do?

214
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,836
你看, 很神奇的. 你有着人类一样的兴趣和好奇心.
You know, it's amazing.
You have an almost human interest and curiosity.

215
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:33,753
Dalek-比人类...跟人类-不太-一样. 如果-要我-帮忙, 我得-知道-所有-事情.
A Dalek is bet... is not the same as a human.
If I am to help, I must know everything.

216
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:35,284
是的, 当然.
Yes. Yes, of course.

217
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:37,367
这个-是-什么-机器?
What is this machine?

218
00:15:37,674 --> 00:15:40,974
它是用来计算陨石风暴的, 以免它们损坏我们的气象卫星.
It computes meteorite storms as they approach our weather satellites.

219
00:15:41,322 --> 00:15:43,214
它有-多-准确?
How accurate is it?

220
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:48,585
大约70％. 它对于降低卫星损失很有帮助.
About, ah, seventy percent.
It helps to cut down on our satellite losses.

221
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:54,602
Daleks-可以-建造-计算机-准确度-达到-百分之百.
Daleks can build pu... computers with one hundred percent accuracy.

222
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,370
百分之百?
One hundred percent?

223
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:03,670
如果-你能-提供-材料, 并给-我们-提供-能量, 计算机-将会-造好.
If you provide materials and our own power unit, a computer will be built.

224
00:16:04,122 --> 00:16:08,703
百分之百. 那对于这个基地将是巨大的节约!
A hundred percent. That would be an enormous saving for the... for the colony!

225
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,429
那么-你能-拿到-材料-吗?
Then, you will get the materials?

226
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:13,280
我马上去跟总督说.
I'll go and speak to the Governor at once.

227
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:18,747
当你-回来-的时候-我-将把-蓝图-准备好.
I will be ready to dictate the blueprint when you return.

228
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,367
嚯. 那真是太棒了!
Huh, huh. Oh, that's marvellous!

229
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:57,755
你同意我们去找 Bragen 的.
You agreed we'd go and see Bragen.

230
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,193
唔? 能量.
Hmm? Power.

231
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:01,256
快点啊!
Come on then!

232
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:04,225
Daleks 的能量入口应该是那个方块...
Now the energy intake for Daleks should be the cube...

233
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:07,499
既然...
Now then...

234
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:09,515
你到底在做什么?
Well, now what are you at?

235
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:12,354
自言自语.
Talk to yourself.

236
00:17:12,835 --> 00:17:15,352
哦, 数据不完整的话就没有用了!
Oh, it's useless with incomplete data!

237
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:25,328
Lesterson!
Lesterson!

238
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:25,975
嗯?
Eh?

239
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:29,354
他刚走过去了. 也就是说我们又可以进他的实验室了.
He just went past. That means we can get into his laboratory again.

240
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:30,418
但我们要去找...
But we're looking for...

241
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:32,271
哦, 来吧, Ben. 过来.
Oh, come along, Ben. Come along.

242
00:17:39,481 --> 00:17:40,722
这里有人.
There's somebody in there.

243
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:44,250
你在-这里-干什么?
What are you doing here?

244
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:49,103
站一边去. 仆人不应该管这个.
Stand aside. Servants shouldn't question.

245
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:51,266
入口-被-禁了.
Entry is restricted.

246
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:54,745
对我没有. "授予一切权限". 我有这个徽章.
Not for me it isn't. "Accord every access". I've got a badge.

247
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:56,256
这是-命令.
That is an order.

248
00:17:56,531 --> 00:17:59,751
Dalek 的命令. 去把生成器弄短路了, Ben.
A Dalek order. Short circuit the generator, Ben.

249
00:18:00,128 --> 00:18:05,629
啊!... 啊!!... 靠后站!
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Stand back!

250
00:18:06,357 --> 00:18:10,275
别怕它 Ben. 它没有武器了. 我倒要看看他打算在这里做什么.
Don't be frightened of it Ben. It's not armed.
I'm going to see what it was doing in there.

251
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:24,487
Ben, 我们快出去!
Ben, let's get out of here!

252
00:18:25,514 --> 00:18:27,477
蠢啊. Lesterson 一定重新激活他们了.
Fool. Lesterson must have reactivated them.

253
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:33,641
是的. 当我说跑的时候, 像个兔子一样快跑. 跑!
Yes. When I say run, run like a rabbit. Run!

254
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:45,661
我-已经-让人类-去-准备-材料了.
I have sent the human being for materials.

255
00:18:45,903 --> 00:18:47,016
还有-能量?
And power?

256
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:55,109
是. 我们-能把-能量-转换为-静电, 然后-我们-就可-征服.
Yes. Power we can turn into static, then we will conquer.

257
00:18:55,433 --> 00:19:03,525
我们-将要-征服... 我们-将要-征服... 我们-将要-征服...
We will conquer... We will conquer... We will conquer...

258
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,750
但是如果不是你干的 Lesterson, 那么 Dalek 肯定是自己用你提供的电源激活了其它几个
But if you didn't do it Lesterson, then the Dalek must
have used your power supply and reactivated the others itself.

259
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:10,671
我正要去激活它们呢.
I was going to do that anyway.

260
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,186
你脑子秀逗了, 伙计? 他们是带武器的!
Are you off your head, mate? Those two are armed!

261
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:18,056
那我们关掉电力供应, 解除他们的武装, 不就万事大吉了.
Then we turn off the electricity, disarm them,
and then everything is safe again.

262
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:19,506
我已经跟你解释过了.
I've already explained to you.

263
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:23,192
停止这些争论吧, 你俩都别说了, 我受够了.
Stop these arguments, both of you. I've had enough.

264
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:27,192
我对 Lesterson 有绝对信心. 从现在开始他将获得全权委托.
I've every confidence in Lesterson.
He has carte blanche for the Daleks from now on.

265
00:19:27,386 --> 00:19:29,083
但他们必须被销毁掉!
But they must be destroyed!

266
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,816
Bragen, 我要下去巡视了, 在此期间这里你说了算
Bragen, I'm making a tour of the perimeter.
I put you in direct charge here.

267
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,816
确保 Lesterson 这里想要什么就给他什么, 好吧?
See that Lesterson gets everything he wants, will you?

268
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:41,004
我实验室还需要一个保安, Bragen.
I shall need a permanent guard on my laboratory, Bragen.

269
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:47,787
别担心监察员. 我想我能让他保持安静.
Don't worry about the Examiner. I think I can keep him quiet.

270
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,611
我们全都忘了 Polly.
We've been forgetting about Polly.

271
00:19:54,889 --> 00:20:01,716
贪婪, 野心勃勃, 那就是它们的本性. 等着吧, 看看他们美妙的产品图能带给他们什么代价!
Greed and ambition, that's all it is. Wait till they find out
what their precious production figures have cost them!

272
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:03,945
哦, 我正要去找你呢.
Oh, I want to see you.

273
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:05,540
为了什么?
What about?

274
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:07,807
是 Polly, 她失踪. 我们在哪儿都找不到她.
Well it's Polly, she's missing. We can't find her anywhere.

275
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:11,770
我安排一个人去找找, 应该很快就可以找到她.
I'll tell one of my men to make enquiries.
It shouldn't take long to find her.

276
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:12,924
多谢了.
Ah, thanks.

277
00:20:13,874 --> 00:20:23,761
监察员, 我的几个手下在水银沼泽里发现了一具尸体, 是一个中年人的.
Examiner, some of my men have found a body in the mercury swamp.
It was the body of a middle-aged man.

278
00:20:24,374 --> 00:20:25,751
这跟我有什么关系吗?
What is that to do with me?

279
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:29,477
你是监察员啊 - 除非你不是.
You're the Examiner - or maybe you're not.

280
00:20:36,243 --> 00:20:38,240
你这么说是什么意思?
Just exactly what do you mean by that?

281
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:41,887
你是谁? Quinn 的朋友? 是来制造骚乱?
Who are you? Quinn's friends? Come to stir up rebellion?

282
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:46,131
如果你认为我不是监察员, 那只有一种可能.
There's only one possible way that you could know I'm not the Examiner.

283
00:20:46,631 --> 00:20:49,326
是的, 那就是知道真正的监察员长什么样!
Yeah, by knowing what the real Examiner looked like!

284
00:20:49,668 --> 00:20:58,194
很对, Ben. 很对! 只有两个人知道他抵达这个星球时的情形：我和杀他的人.
Exactly, Ben. Exactly! Only two people knew of his arrival
on this planet. Myself and his murderer.

285
00:20:58,521 --> 00:20:59,524
够了!
That's enough!

286
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:02,104
是这样? 博士, 我们去告诉总督.
Is it? Doctor, we've got to tell the Governor.

287
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:09,299
你觉得他会相信你? 我很快就可以让他相信是你杀了那个人, 还偷了那个人的徽章.
Do you think he'll believe you? I'll soon convince him
that you murdered the man yourself. You stole the Examiner's badge.

288
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:16,877
那你为什么不逮捕我们? 因为这里还有疑问, 对不? 因为有可能不往你想的方向发展.
Then why don't you arrest us? Because there's a doubt isn't there?
Because it might, it just might, go against you.

289
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:24,953
好吧, 好吧, 我们谁也不想先动. 但你们离 Lesterson 远点 - 还有 Daleks!
All right, all right, so neither of us wants to make a move.
But you leave Lesterson alone - and the Daleks!

290
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,656
他要做一个圣诞老人, 对不
He'd make a right Father Christmas, wouldn't he?

291
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:37,702
哦, 我宁可跟一百个他这种人斗, 也不想碰到一个 Dalek.
Oh, I'd rather fight a hundred of his sort than just one Dalek.

292
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:52,342
听听. "女孩儿很安全. 只要你们远离 Daleks, 她就是安全的".
Listen to this. "The girl is safe.
She will remain so as long as you leave the Daleks alone".

293
00:21:58,261 --> 00:22:00,385
你解除了另外两个的武器?
And did you disarm the other two?

294
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:07,036
是的-我们-是-你的-仆人-我们-不-需要-武器.
Yes. We are your servants. We do not need guns.

295
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,045
我很高兴. 我知道监察员看错你们了.
I'm very glad. I knew the Examiner was wrong about you.

296
00:22:11,387 --> 00:22:13,435
你-给-我们-带来-材料-了-吗?
Did you get our materials?

297
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:16,251
是的. 你们想要什么都行.
Yes. Everything you need you can have.

298
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,848
还有-一个-电厂?
And a power plant?

299
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,007
都行.
Everything.

300
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:32,722
我们-将要-获得-能量(权力)!
We will get our power.
