00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:41,445
他的脸，他的头发，你看!
His face, his hair - look at it!

7
00:01:41,878 --> 00:01:42,913
他还在呼吸...
He's breathing...

8
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:47,344
...而且TARDIS看起来很正常
...and the TARDIS seems to be normal.

9
00:01:49,123 --> 00:01:51,691
Ben, 我们该怎么办? 我们不能把博士扔那儿不管.
Ben, what are we going to do? We can't just leave the Doctor there.

10
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,560
什么, 他是博士?
What, him? The Doctor?

11
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:59,768
嗯，从门外走进来的人就是他 - 外面也没有其他人
Well, that's who came through the doors - there was no one else outside.

12
00:01:59,878 --> 00:02:05,768
Ben, 你记得他在跟踪室内说过什么吗? 好像说＂我的旧身体穿了身新皮囊. "
Ben, do you remember what he said in the tracking room?
Something about "This old body of mine is wearing a bit thin. "

13
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,563
这么说他有了个新的?
So he gets himself a new one?

14
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:10,920
嗯，是的.
Well, yes.

15
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:12,701
哦，得了吧!
Oh, do me a favour!

16
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:18,705
Ben, 这里肯定发生了点什么.
Ben, whatever happened, happened in here.

17
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:20,581
但这不可能啊!
But it's impossible!

18
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:24,316
不久以前，我们还对好多事情说了这句话.
Not so long ago we'd have been saying that about a lot of things.

19
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:29,421
哦, Ben!
Oh, Ben!

20
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:47,273
慢点... 慢点!
Slower... Slower!

21
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,768
聚焦在一个东西上... 就一个!
Concentrate on one thing... one thing!

22
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,586
过去了
It's over.

23
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,163
过去了
It's over.

24
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:58,855
博士?
Doctor?

25
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:30,079
肌肉还有点紧.
The muscles are still a bit tight.

26
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,497
我们该做点什么?
What are we going to do?

27
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,552
他是博士. 我就知道... 我觉得.
It is the Doctor. I know it is... I think.

28
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:44,642
不仅仅是他的脸变了 - 他的行为也不像.
It's not only his face that's changed - he doesn't even act like him.

29
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,677
来吧，我们把这事搞清楚.
Come on, it's time we sorted this out.

30
00:04:57,771 --> 00:04:58,706
现在看这儿!
Now look here!

31
00:04:59,002 --> 00:04:59,759
停住.
Hold that.

32
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:01,395
斜点儿
And tilt it.

33
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,117
你干过这个吗?
Have you done with this?

34
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:22,842
放下，放下.
Put it down, put it down.

35
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:24,985
现在，玩什么游戏?
Now, what's the game?

36
00:05:25,422 --> 00:05:25,879
啊!
Ah!

37
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:28,918
十字军，撒拉丁
The crusades, from Saladin.

38
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:31,994
博士是个收藏家啊!
The Doctor was a great collector, wasn't he!

39
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:33,491
但你就是博士啊!
But you're the Doctor!

40
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,965
哦，我看着不像他.
Oh, I don't look like him.

41
00:05:36,696 --> 00:05:37,828
我们是谁?
Who are we?

42
00:05:38,227 --> 00:05:39,232
你不知道吗?
Don't you know?

43
00:05:47,842 --> 00:05:48,884
Extermination! (Daleks 常用口号，意为"毁灭／终结"）
（博士手里是一块来自Daleks的金属板）
Extermination!

44
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:00,512
啊!
Ah!

45
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:09,624
啊，很好，指甲得长长.
Ah, very good. Nails need growing.

46
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:13,842
看，博士总戴着这个，如果你是他，这个应该大小合适，对不对?
Now look, the Doctor always wore this.
So if you're him, it should fit now, shouldn't it?

47
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:17,529
看 - 掉下来了.
There - that settles it.

48
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:21,416
我想看看蝴蝶展开翅膀后怎么适应它的蛹
I'd like to see a butterfly fit into a chrysalis case
after it's spread its wings.

49
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:22,911
你真的变了!
Then you did change!

50
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:25,527
生命依赖于变化... 和新生.
Life depends on change... and renewal.

51
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:30,736
哦，那就是了 - 你已经重生了，是吧?
Oh, so that's it - you've been renewed, have ya?

52
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:36,187
我已经重生了，是吗？应该是了，我重生了!
I've been renewed, have I? That's it, I've been renewed!

53
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:41,448
这是 TARDIS 的能力，没有它，我就不可能幸存.
It's part of the TARDIS - without it, I couldn't survive.

54
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:42,729
过来!
Come here!

55
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:48,953
到这里来.
Come here.

56
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:55,397
博士持有一本日记，对吧?
The Doctor kept a diary, didn't he?

57
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:56,562
是的.
Yes.

58
00:06:57,976 --> 00:07:00,279
我记得是，不过现在在哪儿呢?
I thought so. Now, I wonder where?

59
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:02,254
在哪儿呢?
I wonder where?

60
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:09,768
他真跟博士有点不同, Ben.
He's a very different Doctor, Ben.

61
00:07:09,998 --> 00:07:12,550
嗯, 很可能. 不过我们现在到底什么情况?
Yeah, maybe. Just where do we stand, though?

62
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:45,934
博士? 博士, 我们会怎样?
Doctor? Doctor, what's going to happen to us?

63
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:54,546
我觉得... 我觉得我们着陆有一阵子了. 我觉得我们该出去逛逛了.
I think... I think we must have landed for sometime.
I think it's time we went for a stroll.

64
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:04,282
但你都不知道我们着陆到哪里了!
But you don't know where we've landed!

65
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,567
别，你还没有检查氧气和温度，什么都没还没检查！
No, you haven't checked the oxygen or the temperature or anything!

66
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:12,553
氧气浓度172，辐射零，温度86
Oxygen density one-seven-two, radiation nil, temperature... eighty-six

67
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:23,153
有较强的水银沉淀. 满意了吗, Ben?
strong suggestion of mercury deposits. Satisfied, Ben?

68
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,500
现在，你们两个来还是不来?
Now, are you two coming or are you not?

69
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:26,294
他真认识我们! 他喊你 "Ben", 听到了吧?
He does know us! He said "Ben", didn't you hear him?

70
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:30,963
是的，听到了. 但他可能只是听到你说了，是吧?
Yeah, I heard. But he might just have been copying you though, mightn't he?

71
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:16,893
噢 不要!
Oh no!

72
00:09:20,218 --> 00:09:21,582
来不来，你俩?
Are you coming, you two?

73
00:09:57,123 --> 00:09:59,522
我得试一试你，我觉得!
Time I put you through some tests, I think!

74
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:04,536
哈罗?
Hello?

75
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:09,893
哈罗? 有人吗? 哈罗?
Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello?

76
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:14,650
哈罗? 他们怎么还不来?
Hello? Why don't they come?

77
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:21,174
啊, 你终于来了. 我从地球来的. 我是监察员...
Ah, so you've come at last. I'm from Earth. I'm the Examin...

78
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:23,841
"地球监察员. 授予所有权限. Vulcan. "
"Earth Examiner. Accord every access. Vulcan. "

79
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,706
博士?! 你在哪儿?
Doctor?! Where are you?

80
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:42,471
喔, 好热!
Whoa, they're hot!

81
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:44,698
唔, 是不是到处的空气都像这样?
Hmm, do you think the air's like this everywhere?

82
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:49,102
不 - 可能只是这一片才这样. 别使劲吸气, 我知道的.
Nah - might be just round here.
Don't want too many lung full of it, I know that.

83
00:11:49,353 --> 00:11:55,302
我小的时候住在一家酒坊对面. 还没走完一趟人就醉了!
Here, when I was a kid, we used to live opposite a brewery.
You could take a walk and get tipsy all in one go!

84
00:11:55,993 --> 00:11:57,465
好美啊!
It's beautiful!

85
00:11:57,748 --> 00:11:58,939
别，别碰, Polly!
No, don't touch it, Polly!

86
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:00,469
我没打算碰.
I wasn't going to.

87
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,840
这是水银 - 会从这些气泡里面出来.
No, it's quicksilver - it gets through the pores.

88
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:08,043
博士要去哪儿啊？ - 就算他是博士吧
Where is the Doctor, or whatever he is, got to?

89
00:12:11,912 --> 00:12:13,378
什么情况? 嘿, Polly!
What's the matter? Hey, Polly!

90
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:17,192
嘿，博士 - 你在哪儿! 快点, Polly这里出事了!
Hey, Doctor - wherever you are!
Quick, there's something happened to Polly!

91
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:20,323
快点，这边!
Quick, over this way!

92
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,282
博士!
Doctor!

93
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:47,504
啊, Quinn, 你在这里啊. 你在这里发现了什么?
Ah, Quinn, there you are. What have you got there?

94
00:12:49,054 --> 00:12:51,492
我的人在其中一个池子边还发现了两个.
My people have found two more of them by one of the pools.

95
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:57,889
这个人脑后受了严重的伤. 然后晕倒了, 我估计。
This one's got a nasty bruise on the back of his head.
Fallen over his feet and knocked himself out, I suppose.

96
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,394
我也觉得.
I suppose so.

97
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:02,209
他们怎么不用我们送给他们的器材呢？
Why don't they use the kit we send them?

98
00:13:02,421 --> 00:13:07,124
是的，另两个人也吸入了烟气 - 至少那个女孩儿是.
Yes, the other two have had a rather bad dose of fumes - the girl has anyway.

99
00:13:07,898 --> 00:13:08,531
女孩?
Girl?

100
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,136
是, 但她会恢复的.
Yes, but she'll recover.

101
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:14,807
你这些着装搞笑的保安总算还有点作用.
These comic-opera guards of yours do have some uses after all.

102
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:16,630
他们是按身体素质挑选出来的.
I pick them for their physical fitness.

103
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:21,285
我也觉得不是按他们的智商. 帮一下监察员，行吗.
I thought it wasn't for their I.Q.
Give me a hand with the Examiner, will you.

104
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:26,027
我很好奇地球为什么要送一个监察员到 Vulcan 来? 我是说，为什么现在?
I wonder why Earth has chosen to send an Examiner to Vulcan? Just now, I mean?

105
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:27,152
我不知道.
I don't know.

106
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:30,270
一个谜题啊. 他应该两年后才上任的.
A mystery, isn't it? He isn't due for another two years.

107
00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:32,768
你感觉如何?
How do you feel?

108
00:13:33,254 --> 00:13:33,785
哦...
Oh...

109
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:36,060
我们看到你们的火箭飞出着陆区了.
We saw your rocket overshoot the landing area.

110
00:13:36,408 --> 00:13:36,914
哦?
Eh?

111
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:41,995
别担心 - 大多数地球来的飞船都会飞出去. 我是 Quinn, 这里的副总督.
Don't worry - most of the ships from Earth do over-shoot.
I'm Quinn, Deputy Governor.

112
00:13:42,236 --> 00:13:43,101
Bragen, 安保队长.
Bragen, Head of Security.

113
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,841
我们回去吧? 我负责带这个女孩儿.
Let's get all back shall we? I'll take the girl.

114
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:48,872
来，你们俩，帮忙扶一下监察员.
Here, you two, help carry the Examiner.

115
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:57,137
我想你们几位地球来的，等不及要看看 Lesterson 的太空舱了吧?
I suppose you Earth people can't wait to examine Lesterson's space capsule?

116
00:13:58,846 --> 00:13:59,581
嗯?
Eh?

117
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:19,349
Lesterson?
Lesterson?

118
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:20,408
看这里.
Look at this.

119
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,748
他们刚带进来了一位地球来的监察员，还有几位助手．
They've just brought in an Examiner from Earth, and a couple of assistants.

120
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,371
监察员? 来干什么?
An Examiner? What's he here for?

121
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,614
我以为你知道.
I thought you'd know.

122
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:29,193
啊，冲着太空舱来的，一定是.
Ah, it's the capsule, it must be.

123
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:32,466
他们不可能拦着我继续搞这个，我跟你说.
Well, they can't stop me working on it, I can tell you that.

124
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:33,915
有人能嘛?
Could anyone?

125
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:39,898
总督那里就一直不好搞. 但他们当然不会从地球送个人过来，只为了...?
The Governor's always been difficult about it.
But surely they wouldn't send someone all the way from Earth just to...?

126
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:41,494
那，会面怎么办?
Look, what about the meeting?

127
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,346
会面?
Meeting?

128
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:45,755
是的 - 我都已经安排好了. 我们可以继续使用旧的火箭室吗?
Yes - I've arranged everything. Can we still use the old rocket room?

129
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:50,450
是的，我觉得可以. 但我觉得你不要把这些压力集团搞混了, Janley.
Yes, I suppose so. But I do wish you wouldn't get mixed up
with these pressure groups, Janley.

130
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:54,033
这样，总有人得做点什么. 这块基地在走下坡路了，你知道的.
Well, somebody has to do something.
The colony's running down and you know it.

131
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:55,291
啊，我太忙了.
Well, I am too busy.

132
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:59,917
但如果我们有所动作的话，你就能有更好的设备，更多的钱．我期望你上点心.
But if we ran things, you'd have better facilities, more money.
I wish you'd take an interest.

133
00:15:00,643 --> 00:15:06,497
看, 我并不介意你常常来借用我的房间, Janley, 但别把我扯进去.
Now look, I don't mind letting you have the use of
one of my rooms now and again, Janley, but don't try to involve me.

134
00:15:08,546 --> 00:15:13,022
这才是我觉得重要地位东西. 在水银沼泽里待了两百年...
This is what I find important.
Two hundred years in a mercury swamp...

135
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:17,009
...这片金属是从上面掉下来的. 看 - 花几分钟抛光一下就跟新的一样了.
...and this piece of metal that dropped from it.
Look - a couple of minutes polishing and it's as good as new.

136
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:18,895
漂亮.
Wonderful.

137
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:27,390
雨水, 湿气, 热浪, 水银 - 什么也不能侵袭这块金属. 没有锈斑, Janley - 想想吧.
Rain, damp, heat, mercury - nothing touches this metal.
No corrosion, Janley - think of that.

138
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:31,812
只是, 我期望监察员能允许你继续你的实验.
Well, I hope the Examiner lets you go on with your experiments.

139
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:34,268
坦白的说, 我有点怀疑.
Frankly, I doubt it.

140
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:41,368
我觉得总督让监察员过来就是为了阻止你打开太空舱的.
I think the Governor's brought the Examiner here
to stop you opening the capsule.

141
00:15:43,153 --> 00:15:47,413
你该加入我们组的, Lesterson. 某天你会需要我们.
You should join our group, Lesterson. You might need us one day.

142
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:01,985
所以被谋杀的人就是真的监察员?
So the murdered man was the real Examiner?

143
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:04,242
那么，你有没有看到是谁干的?
Well, didn't you see who did it?

144
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:07,177
博士, 这里多了颗纽扣.
The Doctor got this button though.

145
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,913
我觉得这挺无聊的. 我不明白我们为什么不回到 TARDIS 去.
Well, I think it's pretty dull around here.
I don't know why we don't just go back to the TARDIS.

146
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:15,238
博士，你是想让他们觉得你就是真正的监察员吗?
Doctor, are you going to let them think you're the real Examiner?

147
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:19,087
嗯，那会不会比较危险?
Well, won't that be dangerous?

148
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:22,959
看，你能不能不再吹那个，认真跟我们说说?
Look, why don't you stop blowing that thing and talk to us properly?

149
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:23,648
Ben!
Ben!

150
00:16:23,842 --> 00:16:24,882
你现在别说话 - 跟他在一起就够糟的了!
Now don't you start - it's bad enough with him!

151
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:25,879
他什么也没做.
Well, he hasn't done anything.

152
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:29,512
不，那就是麻烦所在! 他知道那会儿 TARDIS 里发生了什么
No, that's just the trouble!
He knows what happened back at the TARDIS,

153
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,500
他会告诉我们吗? 他会站出来说? 他会承认他就是博士?
yet will he tell us? Will he come out and say?
Will he admit to being the Doctor?

154
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,727
请进!
Come in!

155
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:45,391
我是 Hensell - 这里的总督. 我想想你们感觉好点了吧?
I am Hensell - the Governor.
I trust you're all feeling much better?

156
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,870
唔，我感觉更差了，总督.
Huh, I've felt worse, Governor.

157
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:49,322
总督?
The Governor?

158
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:55,784
如果地球早点告诉我们你要来，我们就可能可以帮助你着陆了.
If Earth had seen fit to warn us you were coming, we might,
possibly, have been able to guide you down to the landing area.

159
00:16:57,695 --> 00:17:02,871
如果地球没告诉你，总督，他们一定有一个很好理由. 我很好奇到底是什么?
If Earth didn't warn you we were coming, Governor,
they must have had a very good reason. I wonder what it was?

160
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:08,754
你看 - 我负责这块基地. 我有权知道你为什么到 Vulcan 来. 简单说说?
Now look here - I run this Colony. I'm entitled to know
why you've come to Vulcan. What is your brief?

161
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,002
我是监察员.
I am the Examiner.

162
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:11,634
为什么来这儿?
Why are you here?

163
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:16,549
监察. 我现在就要开始检查!
To examine. And I intend to start my examination at once!

164
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:26,650
有人密报说这里有人叛乱，是为了这个吧，是吗?
Someone's leaked reports about these rebel groups
- that's it, isn't it?

165
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:29,420
该你了，总督.
Your turn now, Governor.

166
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:32,007
应该是 Lesterson 的那个舱体.
There is Lesterson's capsule.

167
00:17:32,206 --> 00:17:35,446
内部事物归我管， Bragen. 请不要来干扰我们!
Internal affairs are my business, Bragen.
Please don't interfere!

168
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,067
请继续.
Please go on.

169
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:42,937
这个舱体，是在一个水银沼泽里发现的. 可能在那里已经几个世纪了.
The capsule. It was found in a mercury swamp.
It must have been here for centuries.

170
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,924
有意思 - 继续.
Interesting - continue.

171
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:51,739
在地球殖民者到达前的几个世纪. 我觉得它可能很危险, 它可能带有细菌.
For centuries before the Earth colony arrived.
I felt it might be dangerous, it might contain bacteria.

172
00:17:54,802 --> 00:18:00,116
我应该检查一下这个舱体... 待会儿吧. 你们可以走了
I shall examine the capsule... later. You may leave us.

173
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:04,588
我期待你的报告.
I shall look forward to your report.

173
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:12,288
Bragen, 确保监察员和他的随从 ... 换身得体的衣服，好吧?
Bragen, see that the Examiner and his party...
get some proper clothes, will you?

174
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,157
我们穿得很得体!
We are wearing proper clothes!

175
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:31,579
哦，他怎么拿回那个东西的? 有点厚颜无耻吧?
Oh, how did he get that thing back again?
That was a bit of a cheek, wasn't it?

175
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:35,579
呃，看看总督能不能把他个徽章拿下来?
Er, seeing if the Governor was the guy that you got the button off?

176
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:36,516
博士?
Doctor?

177
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,131
唔?
Mmm?

178
00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:39,425
他跟你说话的时候，你盯着其他人看?
When he was talking to you, you were staring at the other man?

179
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,857
是的，我太失礼了，是吧? 可怕的修养.
Yes, very rude of me, wasn't it? Terrible manners.

180
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:50,107
跟你说实话吧，我是在研究他的反应 - 看他是否赞同那个故事.
To tell you the truth, I was studying his reactions
- seeing if he agreed with the story.

181
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,131
他赞同吗?
Did he?

182
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,765
得看一眼那个舱体.
Must have a look at that capsule.

183
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,078
你最好注意一下, 扮演监察员不要过于投入了.
You know, you wanna watch you don't take this Examiner stuff a bit too far.

184
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:58,409
我们的答案只能从那个水银沼泽里面寻找.
Our answers must come from that mercury swamp.

185
00:18:58,582 --> 00:19:00,930
因为至少有一个家伙不会被骗.
'Cos at least one bloke ain't gonna be fooled.

186
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,083
Bragen 找到我们的时候，他绝对说的是“太空”舱.
When Bragen found us, he definitely said space capsule.

187
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:08,306
你骗不了那个把真监察员召来的人!
Look, you're not going to fool the guy that did the real Examiner in!

188
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,584
Bragen! 为什么见一下监察员还得先征得同意?
Bragen! What's all this nonsense about
having to have a pass to see the Examiner?

189
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,893
这是总督的主意.
It's the Governor's idea.

190
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:23,041
当然这对我不适用吧?
Surely it doesn't apply to me?

191
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:27,144
不是我下的命令, Quinn. 我觉得总督不想让人靠近他.
It's not my order, Quinn.
I expect the Governor wants to keep people away from him.

192
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:28,877
听起来像是你们这类 red-tape 的主意.
It sounded like one of your red-tape ideas.

193
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,405
这跟我没关系.
It has nothing to do with me.

194
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:32,237
正确!
Right!

195
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:37,703
哦!
Oh!

196
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,007
对不起, Janley.
Sorry, Janley.

197
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:39,740
我的错.
My fault.

198
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:40,871
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

199
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,121
是的. Lesterson 刚把我从实验室赶出来了.
Yes. Lesterson's just cleared me out of his lab.

200
00:19:45,857 --> 00:19:48,019
监察员会允许他打开舱体吗?
Is the Examiner going to let him open the capsule?

201
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:52,885
我不知道. 我正在往那边走... 如果我能挤过 Bragen 的保安人墙的话.
I don't know. I'm on my way there now...
if I can push past Bragen's army of layabouts.

202
00:20:20,661 --> 00:20:21,559
你在哪里得到这个的?
Where did you get this?

203
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,493
从舱体上掉下来的.
It dropped from the capsule.

204
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:24,220
掉下来?
Dropped?

205
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:27,560
是的, 把它拖进实验室的时候.
Yes, when it was being hauled into the laboratory.

205
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:32,560
不过，你看! 这种金属可以会对我们的太空旅行技术产生革命性影响.
But, you can see! This metal could revolutionise space travel.

206
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,560
这也是为什么我坚持要打开舱体. 谁知道里面还有什么其它神奇的东西?
That's why I'm insisting that we open it.
Well, who knows what other marvels there may be inside?

207
00:20:37,815 --> 00:20:40,162
不过 Lesterson, 我没想到你能打开它?
But Lesterson, I didn't think you could open it?

208
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:48,831
我有一个理论. 我推断打开的方法是在两端，要么这边，要么这边.
Well, I have a theory. I'm convinced that the opening
mechanism on the other side is either here, or here.

209
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,780
Extermination...
终结...

210
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:56,049
我的理论是可以在这个背脊处注入激光束.
Now, my theory is that I can insert a laser ray in this ridge here.

211
00:20:56,768 --> 00:21:01,408
光束散开, 触发开门设备，我们就可以进去了.
The ray spreads, fuses the opening device and gets us in.

212
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,894
监察员, 我觉得该你来决策了.
Examiner, I shall have to make it your responsibility.

213
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,102
激光? 没问题? 不会太难.
A laser? Why not? It shouldn't be too difficult.

214
00:21:15,652 --> 00:21:18,285
我们来试试另外一边.
Well, we'll try the other side.

215
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:47,803
唔, 有一点... 让人失望.
Hmm, it's a bit... disappointing.

216
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:50,392
不会. 这只是门廊, 对吧?
Not really. This is just an entry bay, isn't it?

217
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,708
是的... 我觉得是.
Yes, I... I suppose so.

218
00:21:53,074 --> 00:21:54,560
那并没有让我们走多远是吧?
Well, this doesn't get us very far does it?

219
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:57,751
进到舱体其它部分就需要时间了，总督.
Ah, getting into the rest of the capsule will take time, Governor.

220
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,108
你不能再用一下那个光束吗？那肯定是一个门.
Well, can't you use that torch thing again?
That must be an opening door.

221
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:03,244
我得考察一下，看看锁机关在哪儿.
Well, I should have to measure it up
and find out where the lock mechanism is.

222
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,012
我觉得今晚就到此为止吧.
And I think we'll leave if for tonight.

223
00:22:05,264 --> 00:22:05,823
到此为止?
Leave it?

224
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:08,012
就这样了? 那我们来这儿干什么?
Leave it for tonight? But what did we come here for?

225
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:09,630
这是我的决定，总督.
That is my decision, Governor.

226
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:11,013
但是，苍天在上!
But, good heavens above, man!

227
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:13,103
两百年，你说它被埋了?
Two hundred years, you say, this has been buried?

228
00:22:13,343 --> 00:22:16,566
哦，至少有. 里面的隔间里一定有什么东西.
Oh, at least. Now, there must be something in the inner compartment.

229
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:19,390
我们应该可以搞明白它是从哪里来的.
We shall be able to find out where it came from originally.

230
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,235
它并不是来自这个星球 - Vulcan.
It didn't come from this planet - Vulcan.

231
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,051
哦，不不不. 这个金属很外星.
Oh no, no, no. The metal is quite alien.

232
00:22:24,338 --> 00:22:30,071
外星，是的. 非常外星. 晚安.
Alien, yes. Very alien. Goodnight.

233
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,680
他这是怎么了?
What's he up to now?

234
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,764
Ben, 不要让他离开我们的视线.
Ben, we're not going to let him out of our sight.

235
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:47,545
好了，Lesterson, 你有路子. 不过你找来这监察员值得吗? 就这个愚蠢的家伙?
Well, Lesterson, you got your way.
Was it worth sending for this Examiner? This idiotic Examiner?

236
00:22:47,855 --> 00:22:49,588
不是我找你的. 我还以为是你呢.
I didn't send for him. I thought you did.

237
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:53,190
你为什么不让我跟监察员说话，Hensell? 我能找出他来这里的原因.
Why don't you let me talk to the Examiner, Hensell?
I can find out what's he's here for.

238
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:56,120
不不不, 你离他远点. 我们让他跟 Lesterson 呆一起吧.
No, no, no, no, you keep away from him.
We'll leave him to work with Lesterson here.

239
00:22:56,363 --> 00:22:59,820
我们都有太多事情要做，负担不起来自地球的业余批评.
We've all got enough to do without having to worry about
some amateur critic from Earth interfering.

240
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:01,433
但只要５分钟, 我 _...
But with five minutes, I _...

241
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:06,097
你听到我的话了, Quinn. 你不介意让监察员忙得团团转吧, Lesterson?
You heard what I said, Quinn.
You won't mind keeping the Examiner busy, Lesterson?

242
00:23:06,331 --> 00:23:10,497
我不介意你跟他做什么 ... 只要他的鼻子别到我的事情里面来到处嗅.
I don't mind what you do with him so long as you keep his nose...
out of our business.

243
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:11,541
好. 没问题.
Yes. All right.

244
00:23:11,846 --> 00:23:13,452
就这样. 我们明早再讨论.
All right. Well, we shall talk about it tomorrow.

245
00:23:27,555 --> 00:23:28,141
Ben!
Ben!

246
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:29,459
什么?
What?

247
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:30,909
嘘! 他在走廊里.
Shh! He's in the corridor.

248
00:23:31,098 --> 00:23:31,669
谁?
Who is?

249
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:33,294
博士, 你个笨蛋! 过来 - 快!
The Doctor, you clod! Come on - quick!

250
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:40,963
他往 Lesterson 的实验室去了.
He's going towards Lesterson's lab.

251
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:42,895
当然 - 那个太空舱!
Of course - to the space capsule!

252
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:43,901
快点.
Come on.

253
00:25:00,887 --> 00:25:06,311
Polly, Ben, 进来见见 Daleks.
Polly, Ben, come in and meet the Daleks.

254
00:25:06,616 --> 00:25:07,401
什么?
What?

255
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:09,083
Daleks.
The Daleks.

256
00:25:27,678 --> 00:25:29,136
你以前就打开过这个.
You could have opened this before.

257
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:34,161
这两片金属是一样的. 其中一片是博士直接从 Daleks 那里得到的.
These two pieces of metal are identical.
The Doctor got one of them from the Daleks himself.

258
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:36,516
为什么你一直说“博士怎样怎样”，但你意思是在说你自己?
Why do you keep saying the Doctor if you mean you?

259
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:42,367
我知道我可以在这里找到他们 - 我就知道.
I knew I should find them here - I knew it.

260
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:46,462
啊, 他们看起来是无害的, 并不活跃.
Ah, they look harmless, not very lively.

261
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:50,079
你想什么呢? 在沼泽里呆200年，你也看起来不活跃
What do you think? Two hundred years in a swamp
and you wouldn't look very lively either.

261
00:25:50,203 --> 00:25:52,079
没有什么东西能熬过来，是吧?
Nothing could live through that, could it?

262
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,092
活的?
Live?

263
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:54,851
不是人类, 不.
Nothing human, no.

264
00:25:56,307 --> 00:25:58,019
博士, 看!
