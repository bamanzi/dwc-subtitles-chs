1
00:00:02,105 --> 00:00:03,105
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:41,945
His face, his hair - look at it!

3
00:01:42,378 --> 00:01:43,413
He's breathing...

4
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:47,844
...and the TARDIS seems to be normal.

5
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:52,191
Ben, what are we going to do? We can't just leave the Doctor there.

6
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,060
What, him? The Doctor?

7
00:01:55,378 --> 00:02:06,268
Well, that's who came through the doors - there was no one else outside. Ben, do you remember what he said in the tracking room? Something about "This old body of mine is wearing a bit thin. "

8
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,063
So he gets himself a new one?

9
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:11,420
Well, yes.

10
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:13,201
Oh, do me a favour!

11
00:02:17,077 --> 00:02:19,205
Ben, whatever happened, happened in here.

12
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:21,081
But it's impossible!

13
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:24,816
Not so long ago we'd have been saying that about a lot of things.

14
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:29,921
Oh, Ben!

15
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:47,773
Slower... Slower!

16
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,268
Concentrate on one thing... one thing!

17
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,086
It's over.

18
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,663
It's over.

19
00:03:58,209 --> 00:03:59,355
Doctor?

20
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:30,579
The muscles are still a bit tight.

21
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:36,997
What are we going to do?

22
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,852
It is the Doctor. I know it is... I think.

23
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:45,142
It's not only his face that's changed - he doesn't even act like him.

24
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,177
Come on, it's time we sorted this out.

25
00:04:58,271 --> 00:04:59,206
Now look here!

26
00:04:59,502 --> 00:05:00,259
Hold that.

27
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:01,895
And tilt it.

28
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,617
Have you done with this?

29
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:23,342
Put it down, put it down.

30
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:25,485
Now, what's the game?

31
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:26,379
Ah!

32
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:29,418
The crusades, from Saladin.

33
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,494
The Doctor was a great collector, wasn't he!

34
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:33,991
But you're the Doctor!

35
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,465
Oh, I don't look like him.

36
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:38,328
Who are we?

37
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:39,732
Don't you know?

38
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:49,384
Extermination!

39
00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:01,012
Ah!

40
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:10,124
Ah, very good. Nails need growing.

41
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:14,342
Now look, the Doctor always wore this. So if you're him, it should fit now, shouldn't it?

42
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:18,029
There - that settles it.

43
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:21,916
I'd like to see a butterfly fit into a chrysalis case after it's spread its wings.

44
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:23,411
Then you did change!

45
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:26,027
Life depends on change... and renewal.

46
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:31,236
Oh, so that's it - you've been renewed, have ya?

47
00:06:31,743 --> 00:06:36,687
I've been renewed, have I? That's it, I've been renewed!

48
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:41,948
It's part of the TARDIS - without it, I couldn't survive.

49
00:06:42,204 --> 00:06:43,229
Come here!

50
00:06:48,878 --> 00:06:49,453
Come here.

51
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:55,897
The Doctor kept a diary, didn't he?

52
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:57,062
Yes.

53
00:06:57,976 --> 00:07:00,279
I thought so. Now, I wonder where?

54
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:02,254
I wonder where?

55
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:11,168
He's a very different Doctor, Ben.

56
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,950
Yeah, maybe. Just where do we stand, though?

57
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:47,334
Doctor? Doctor, what's going to happen to us?

58
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:55,946
I think... I think we must have landed for sometime. I think it's time we went for a stroll.

59
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:05,682
But you don't know where we've landed!

60
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,967
No, you haven't checked the oxygen or the temperature or anything!

61
00:08:10,176 --> 00:08:23,153
Oxygen density one-seven-two, radiation nil, temperature... eighty-six - strong suggestion of mercury deposits. Satisfied, Ben? Now, are you two coming or are you not?

62
00:08:24,752 --> 00:08:27,694
He does know us! He said "Ben", didn't you hear him?

63
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:32,363
Yeah, I heard. But he might just have been copying you though, mightn't he?

64
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:18,293
Oh no!

65
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:22,982
Are you coming, you two?

66
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:00,922
Time I put you through some tests, I think!

67
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:04,936
Hello?

68
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:10,293
Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello?

69
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:15,050
Hello? Why don't they come?

70
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:21,574
Ah, so you've come at last. I'm from Earth. I'm the Examin...

71
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:24,241
"Earth Examiner. Accord every access. Vulcan. "

72
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:33,106
Doctor?! Where are you?

73
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,871
Whoa, they're hot!

74
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:45,098
Hmm, do you think the air's like this everywhere?

75
00:11:45,353 --> 00:11:55,702
Nah - might be just round here. Don't want too many lung full of it, I know that. Here, when I was a kid, we used to live opposite a brewery. You could take a walk and get tipsy all in one go!

76
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:57,865
It's beautiful!

77
00:11:58,148 --> 00:11:59,339
No, don't touch it, Polly!

78
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:00,869
I wasn't going to.

79
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,240
No, it's quicksilver - it gets through the pores.

80
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:08,443
Where is the Doctor, or whatever he is, got to?

81
00:12:12,312 --> 00:12:13,778
What's the matter? Hey, Polly!

82
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:17,592
Hey, Doctor - wherever you are! Quick, there's something happened to Polly!

83
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,723
Quick, over this way!

84
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,682
Doctor!

85
00:12:44,452 --> 00:12:47,904
Ah, Quinn, there you are. What have you got there?

86
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:51,892
My people have found two more of them by one of the pools.

87
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:58,289
This one's got a nasty bruise on the back of his head. Fallen over his feet and knocked himself out, I suppose.

88
00:12:58,539 --> 00:12:59,794
I suppose so.

89
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:02,609
Why don't they use the kit we send them?

90
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:07,524
Yes, the other two have had a rather bad dose of fumes - the girl has anyway.

91
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:08,931
Girl?

92
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:10,536
Yes, but she'll recover.

93
00:13:10,836 --> 00:13:15,207
These comic-opera guards of yours do have some uses after all.

94
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,030
I pick them for their physical fitness.

95
00:13:17,237 --> 00:13:21,685
I thought it wasn't for their I.Q. Give me a hand with the Examiner, will you.

96
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:26,427
I wonder why Earth has chosen to send an Examiner to Vulcan? Just now, I mean?

97
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:27,552
I don't know.

98
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:30,670
A mystery, isn't it? He isn't due for another two years.

99
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:33,168
How do you feel?

100
00:13:33,654 --> 00:13:34,185
Oh...

101
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,460
We saw your rocket overshoot the landing area.

102
00:13:36,808 --> 00:13:37,314
Eh?

103
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:42,395
Don't worry - most of the ships from Earth do over-shoot. I'm Quinn, Deputy Governor.

104
00:13:42,636 --> 00:13:43,501
Bragen, Head of Security.

105
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,241
Let's get all back shall we? I'll take the girl.

106
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,272
Here, you two, help carry the Examiner.

107
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:56,537
I suppose you Earth people can't wait to examine Lesterson's space capsule?

108
00:13:58,246 --> 00:13:58,981
Eh?

109
00:14:18,795 --> 00:14:19,849
Lesterson?

110
00:14:20,073 --> 00:14:20,908
Look at this.

111
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,248
They've just brought in an Examiner from Earth, and a couple of assistants.

112
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:24,871
An Examiner? What's he here for?

113
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:26,114
I thought you'd know.

114
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:29,693
Ah, it's the capsule, it must be.

115
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:32,966
Well, they can't stop me working on it, I can tell you that.

116
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:34,415
Could anyone?

117
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:40,398
The Governor's always been difficult about it. But surely they wouldn't send someone all the way from Earth just to...?

118
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:41,994
Look, what about the meeting?

119
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:42,846
Meeting?

120
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:46,255
Yes - I've arranged everything. Can we still use the old rocket room?

121
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:50,950
Yes, I suppose so. But I do wish you wouldn't get mixed up with these pressure groups, Janley.

122
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:54,533
Well, somebody has to do something. The colony's running down and you know it.

123
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:55,791
Well, I am too busy.

124
00:14:55,945 --> 00:15:00,417
But if we ran things, you'd have better facilities, more money. I wish you'd take an interest.

125
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:06,997
Now look, I don't mind letting you have the use of one of my rooms now and again, Janley, but don't try to involve me.

126
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:13,522
This is what I find important. Two hundred years in a mercury swamp...

127
00:15:13,717 --> 00:15:17,509
...and this piece of metal that dropped from it. Look - a couple of minutes polishing and it's as good as new.

128
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:19,395
Wonderful.

129
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:27,890
Rain, damp, heat, mercury - nothing touches this metal. No corrosion, Janley - think of that.

130
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:32,312
Well, I hope the Examiner lets you go on with your experiments.

131
00:15:32,978 --> 00:15:34,768
Frankly, I doubt it.

132
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:41,868
I think the Governor's brought the Examiner here to stop you opening the capsule.

133
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:47,913
You should join our group, Lesterson. You might need us one day.

134
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:02,485
So the murdered man was the real Examiner?

135
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:04,742
Well, didn't you see who did it?

136
00:16:05,878 --> 00:16:07,677
The Doctor got this button though.

137
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,413
Well, I think it's pretty dull around here. I don't know why we don't just go back to the TARDIS.

138
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:15,738
Doctor, are you going to let them think you're the real Examiner?

139
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:19,587
Well, won't that be dangerous?

140
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:23,459
Look, why don't you stop blowing that thing and talk to us properly?

141
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:24,148
Ben!

142
00:16:24,342 --> 00:16:25,382
Now don't you start - it's bad enough with him!

143
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,379
Well, he hasn't done anything.

144
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:33,012
No, that's just the trouble! He knows what happened back at the TARDIS, yet will he tell us? Will he come out and say? Will he admit to being the Doctor?

145
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,227
Come in!

146
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:45,891
I am Hensell - the Governor. I trust you're all feeling much better?

147
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,370
Huh, I've felt worse, Governor.

148
00:16:48,682 --> 00:16:49,822
The Governor?

149
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:56,284
If Earth had seen fit to warn us you were coming, we might, possibly, have been able to guide you down to the landing area.

150
00:16:57,695 --> 00:17:02,871
If Earth didn't warn you we were coming, Governor, they must have had a very good reason. I wonder what it was?

151
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:09,254
Now look here - I run this Colony. I'm entitled to know why you've come to Vulcan. What is your brief?

152
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,502
I am the Examiner.

153
00:17:10,852 --> 00:17:12,134
Why are you here?

154
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:17,049
To examine. And I intend to start my examination at once!

155
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:27,150
Someone's leaked reports about these rebel groups - that's it, isn't it?

156
00:17:28,498 --> 00:17:29,920
Your turn now, Governor.

157
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:32,507
There is Lesterson's capsule.

158
00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:35,946
Internal affairs are my business, Bragen. Please don't interfere!

159
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,567
Please go on.

160
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:43,437
The capsule. It was found in a mercury swamp. It must have been here for centuries.

161
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,424
Interesting - continue.

162
00:17:45,757 --> 00:17:52,239
For centuries before the Earth colony arrived. I felt it might be dangerous, it might contain bacteria.

163
00:17:55,302 --> 00:18:00,616
I shall examine the capsule... later. You may leave us.

164
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:12,788
I shall look forward to your report. Bragen, see that the Examiner and his party... get some proper clothes, will you?

165
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:24,657
We are wearing proper clothes!

166
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:36,079
Oh, how did he get that thing back again? That was a bit of a cheek, wasn't it? Er, seeing if the Governor was the guy that you got the button off?

167
00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:37,016
Doctor?

168
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:37,631
Mmm?

169
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:39,925
When he was talking to you, you were staring at the other man?

170
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:43,357
Yes, very rude of me, wasn't it? Terrible manners.

171
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:50,607
To tell you the truth, I was studying his reactions - seeing if he agreed with the story.

172
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,631
Did he?

173
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,265
Must have a look at that capsule.

174
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,178
You know, you wanna watch you don't take this Examiner stuff a bit too far.

175
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:58,909
Our answers must come from that mercury swamp.

176
00:18:59,082 --> 00:19:00,830
'Cos at least one bloke ain't gonna be fooled.

177
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,583
When Bragen found us, he definitely said space capsule.

178
00:19:05,867 --> 00:19:08,806
Look, you're not going to fool the guy that did the real Examiner in!

179
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,084
Bragen! What's all this nonsense about having to have a pass to see the Examiner?

180
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,393
It's the Governor's idea.

181
00:19:22,617 --> 00:19:23,541
Surely it doesn't apply to me?

182
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:27,644
It's not my order, Quinn. I expect the Governor wants to keep people away from him.

183
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:29,377
It sounded like one of your red-tape ideas.

184
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,905
It has nothing to do with me.

185
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:32,737
Right!

186
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:38,203
Oh!

187
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,507
Sorry, Janley.

188
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,240
My fault.

189
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,371
Are you all right?

190
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,621
Yes. Lesterson's just cleared me out of his lab.

191
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:48,519
Is the Examiner going to let him open the capsule?

192
00:19:48,707 --> 00:19:53,385
I don't know. I'm on my way there now... if I can push past Bragen's army of layabouts.

193
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:22,059
Where did you get this?

194
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,993
It dropped from the capsule.

195
00:20:24,202 --> 00:20:24,720
Dropped?

196
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:38,060
Yes, when it was being hauled into the laboratory. But, you can see! This metal could revolutionise space travel. That's why I'm insisting that we open it. Well, who knows what other marvels there may be inside?

197
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:40,662
But Lesterson, I didn't think you could open it?

198
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:49,331
Well, I have a theory. I'm convinced that the opening mechanism on the other side is either here, or here.

199
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,280
Extermination...

200
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:56,549
Now, my theory is that I can insert a laser ray in this ridge here.

201
00:20:57,268 --> 00:21:01,908
The ray spreads, fuses the opening device and gets us in.

202
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,394
Examiner, I shall have to make it your responsibility.

203
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,602
A laser? Why not? It shouldn't be too difficult.

204
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:18,785
Well, we'll try the other side.

205
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:48,303
Hmm, it's a bit... disappointing.

206
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:50,892
Not really. This is just an entry bay, isn't it?

207
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,208
Yes, I... I suppose so.

208
00:21:53,574 --> 00:21:55,060
Well, this doesn't get us very far does it?

209
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:58,251
Ah, getting into the rest of the capsule will take time, Governor.

210
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,608
Well, can't you use that torch thing again? That must be an opening door.

211
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:03,744
Well, I should have to measure it up and find out where the lock mechanism is.

212
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,512
And I think we'll leave if for tonight.

213
00:22:05,764 --> 00:22:06,323
Leave it?

214
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:08,512
Leave it for tonight? But what did we come here for?

215
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:10,130
That is my decision, Governor.

216
00:22:10,327 --> 00:22:11,513
But, good heavens above, man!

217
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:13,603
Two hundred years, you say, this has been buried?

218
00:22:13,843 --> 00:22:17,066
Oh, at least. Now, there must be something in the inner compartment.

219
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,890
We shall be able to find out where it came from originally.

220
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,735
It didn't come from this planet - Vulcan.

221
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,551
Oh no, no, no. The metal is quite alien.

222
00:22:24,838 --> 00:22:30,571
Alien, yes. Very alien. Goodnight.

223
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,180
What's he up to now?

224
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,264
Ben, we're not going to let him out of our sight.

225
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:48,045
Well, Lesterson, you got your way. Was it worth sending for this Examiner? This idiotic Examiner?

226
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:50,088
I didn't send for him. I thought you did.

227
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:53,690
Why don't you let me talk to the Examiner, Hensell? I can find out what's he's here for.

228
00:22:53,863 --> 00:23:00,320
No, no, no, no, you keep away from him. We'll leave him to work with Lesterson here. We've all got enough to do without having to worry about some amateur critic from Earth interfering.

229
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,933
But with five minutes, I _...

230
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:10,997
You heard what I said, Quinn. You won't mind keeping the Examiner busy, Lesterson? I don't mind what you do with him so long as you keep his nose... out of our business.

231
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:12,041
Yes. All right.

232
00:23:12,346 --> 00:23:13,952
All right. Well, we shall talk about it tomorrow.

233
00:23:28,055 --> 00:23:28,641
Ben!

234
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:29,959
What?

235
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:31,409
Shh! He's in the corridor.

236
00:23:31,598 --> 00:23:32,169
Who is?

237
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:33,794
The Doctor, you clod! Come on - quick!

238
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:41,463
He's going towards Lesterson's lab.

239
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:43,395
Of course - to the space capsule!

240
00:23:43,712 --> 00:23:44,401
Come on.

241
00:25:00,887 --> 00:25:06,311
Polly, Ben, come in and meet the Daleks.

242
00:25:06,616 --> 00:25:07,401
What?

243
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:09,083
The Daleks.

244
00:25:27,678 --> 00:25:29,136
You could have opened this before.

245
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:34,161
These two pieces of metal are identical. The Doctor got one of them from the Daleks himself.

246
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:36,516
Why do you keep saying the Doctor if you mean you?

247
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:42,367
I knew I should find them here - I knew it.

248
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:46,462
Ah, they look harmless, not very lively.

249
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:52,079
What do you think? Two hundred years in a swamp and you wouldn't look very lively either. Nothing could live through that, could it?

250
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,092
Live?

251
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:54,851
Nothing human, no.

252
00:25:56,307 --> 00:25:58,019
Doctor, look!

253
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:00,374
What's the matter?

254
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:09,457
Well, there were three Daleks in here! What's happened to the other one?

255
00:26:13,316 --> 00:26:14,295
Doctor!
