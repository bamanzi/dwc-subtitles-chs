What's the matter? What is it?

27
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:29,744
你生病了吗?
Are you ill?

28
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:35,743
它们在里面 - 制造它们自己! 在复制!
They're in there - making themselves! Duplicating!

29
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,360
什么? 你在说什么?
What? What are you talking about?

30
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:41,182
是我挑起的, 打开了太空舱!
I started this, opening the capsule!

31
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:42,109
Lesterson!
Lesterson!

32
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:43,418
别想阻止我!
Don't try to stop me!

33
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:44,465
发生了什么?
What happened?

34
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:53,077
它们忘记了是该由我控制! 我重新给了它们生命复活了它们
They forget that I control them! I gave them life back again

35
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:59,077
现在我要拿走! 结束他们! 阻止它们!
And now I've taken it away! Finished! Stopped it!

36
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:00,518
那些 Daleks...
The Daleks...

37
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:08,314
邪恶! 恐怖! 我知道我要干什么了! 激光束!
Evil! Horrible! I know what I'm going to do! Laser torches!

38
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:15,314
把他们融掉! 我要把这些 Daleks 融化为金属池!
Melt them down! I'm going to melt the Daleks down to pools of metal!

39
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:16,503
你不会的 Lesterson!
You won't Lesterson!

40
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:23,298
啊, 你觉得我还顾忌你能做什么?! 去吧, 告诉每一个人是我害死了Resno!
Ah, do you think I care what you can do?!
Go on, tell everybody I was responsible for Resno's death!

41
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:27,098
我不在乎! 我要抹平这些 Daleks!
I don't care! I'm going to wipe out the Daleks!

42
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,648
是的, 告诉每一个人我的事. 我还是要...我要... 抹掉这些 Daleks!
Yes, tell everybody all about me! I'm still going to...
I'm going to... wipe out the Daleks!

43
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:38,361
给我接监察员. 监狱? 谁把他关进去的?
Get me the Examiner. Prison? Who put him there?

44
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:46,361
但我要跟他谈话! 我必须要, 听不懂吗?!
But I've got to talk to him! I've got to, don't you understand?!

45
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:58,332
你怎么过来的?! 我已经把电源切断了!
How did you get there?! I cut off the power!

46
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:03,993
我们-可以-储存-能量 我们-很快-会有-自己的-能量
We can store power. We will soon have our own.

47
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:06,347
自己的能量?!
Own power?!

48
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:09,488
为什么-舱门-关闭了
Why was the capsule door closed?

49
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,305
自己的能量?! 啊!
Own power?! Ahh!

50
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,720
封闭-舱体-秘密-入口
Seal off the capsule's secret entrance.

51
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:25,072
我-服从
I obey.

52
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:26,983
等!
Wait!

53
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:33,588
每次-不要-三个-以上-Daleks-同时-出现-被人-看到
No more than three Daleks to be seen together at any one time.

54
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:35,061
我-服从
I obey.

55
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:44,203
我们-还没-打算-教导-这些-人类-学习-Daleks-的法律
We are not ready yet to teach these human beings the law of the Daleks.

56
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:49,848
你可以帮我!
You can help me!

57
00:04:50,712 --> 00:04:51,552
什么事情?
What's the matter?

58
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,711
监察员... 监察员在哪儿?! 我...
Where... where's the Examiner?! I _?!

59
00:04:53,865 --> 00:04:55,023
监察员在监狱里
The Examiner's in prison.

60
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,363
啊, 是的
Ah, yes.

61
00:04:57,603 --> 00:04:58,733
你怎么回事?
What's the matter with you?

62
00:04:59,051 --> 00:04:59,714
我忘了...
I forgot.

63
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,972
为什么跑? 嘿!
What are you running for? Hey!

64
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:10,611
Lesterson 回来了吗?
Did Lesterson come back?

65
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:15,095
没有. 为什么-这个人-被-限制-自由?
No. Why is this human restricted?

66
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:16,884
她反对 Daleks.
She's against the Daleks.

67
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:22,521
害怕了, 是吧? 如果你乖乖地话就什么事情也没有
Afraid, are you? Nothing's going to happen to you if you behave.

68
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:24,623
Daleks? 我当然害怕 - 你也应该害怕
The Daleks? Of course I'm afraid - and so should you be.

69
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:26,185
Daleks 将要帮助我们
The Daleks are going to help us.

70
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:28,553
“我们”是指叛乱分子吧, 没说错的话
'Us' being the rebels, I suppose.

71
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,651
随你便.
If you like.

72
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:35,421
而且如果你们赢了的话, Daleks 会回来继续当仆人? 你们比我想的还要蠢
And when you've won, the Daleks will just go back
to being servants again? You're bigger fools than I thought.

73
00:05:35,638 --> 00:05:37,855
我们-是-你们的-仆人
We are your servants.

74
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:39,258
While it suits you.
While it suits you.

75
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:40,077
走着瞧
You'll see.

76
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:40,924
进去!
In!

77
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,271
你想要我留这里看着她吗?
you want me to stay with her?

78
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:48,351
是的. 你可能还得帮一下 Valmar. 他马上过来, 来修 Dalek 需要的新电缆
Yes. You may have to help Valmar. He'll be here in a minute
to fix up the new Dalek cower... power cable.

79
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:49,058
好.
Right.

80
00:05:50,303 --> 00:05:53,518
什么-时候-这项-工作-完成?
When will the work be completed?

81
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:56,756
你们 Daleks 在铺设的这是什么线缆?
What is this cable you Daleks are laying, anyway?

82
00:05:56,975 --> 00:06:01,064
Daleks-需要-静电-才能-运转
Daleks operate on static electricity.

83
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,052
静电! 这可能吗?
Static! Is that possible?

84
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:09,406
为了-制造-静电  Daleks-需要-完整的-线缆-回路
To create static, the Daleks need a complete cable circuit.

85
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:14,980
我明白了. 你把我们对我电能转换成了你们的能量
I see. You convert our electricity into your own power.

86
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:20,549
正确   什么-时候-这人-可以-完成-这项-工作?
That is correct. When will the human being complete the work?

87
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:26,269
他马上就来了. 现在比较容易了, 没有人干涉我们的计划了
He'll be here. It's easier now.
There's no-one to interfere with our plans.

88
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:38,757
你必须做这个吗? 恐怕你会发现这些锁普通人是打不开的
Do you have to do that? I'm afraid you'll find these locks are foolproof.

89
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:40,498
我很好奇他们是怎么转换能量的
I wonder how they're converting the power?

90
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:42,449
你在说什么啊...?
Wha... What are you talking about?

91
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:47,978
Daleks - 它们是依赖静电供能的, 静电就像它们的血液一样 - 一种持续的生命流
The Daleks - they're powered by static electricity.
It's like blood to them - a constant life-stream.

92
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:49,348
静电没法使用啊!
Static isn't workable!

93
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:54,800
对 Daleks 来说是可用的. 他们已经征服了静电, 正如他们征服了反磁场一样
It is to the Daleks. They've conquered static,
just as they've conquered anti-magnetics.

94
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,817
我不打算继续听这些胡说八道了
I'm not going to listen to any more of this nonsense.

95
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:59,110
似乎我总没法发出正确的声调
I don't seem to be able to hit the right note.

96
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:03,540
你那儿还有水吗?
Do you have any more water?

97
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,565
我期望没有. 没有
I hope not. No.

98
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:07,639
那我就得再搞点
Then I shall have to get some.

99
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,729
你没办法!
You can't!

100
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:11,223
但这很重要! 已经穷途陌路了!
But it's important! It's desperately important!

101
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:12,456
Bragen 下了命令了
Well, Bragen gave orders.

102
00:07:12,653 --> 00:07:13,646
别挡我的道
Just get out of my way!

103
00:07:13,835 --> 00:07:15,430
啊, 监察员, 那些 Daleks
Ah! Examiner! The Daleks...!

104
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,118
怎么了?
Yes?

105
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:19,393
他们在复制! 我都看见了!
They're duplicating! I've seen them!

106
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:23,211
它们现在有自己的能力了! 我没法阻止它们
They've got their own power now! I... I can't stop them!

107
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,648
把他带到 Bragen 那里去
Take him to Bragen.

108
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:26,869
噢... 噢... 噢...
Oh!... Oh!... Oh!...

109
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:32,953
听我说, 你觉得可否再给我们一点水?
I say. I say, do you think we might have a little more water?

110
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:41,939
你能说的就是这个? Lesterson 好不容易跑进来跟你情况, 你就只是再要一点水?
Is that all you can say? Lesterson fights his way down here
to speak to you and all you can do is demand more water?!

111
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:48,881
离门远一点
Get away from the door.

112
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:08,454
抱歉刚才发飙了, 我也是期望有所帮助
Sorry about that outburst.
I thought it might help the situation.

113
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:16,579
快了, 快了
Nearly... Nearly...

114
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:25,875
这是什么情况?
What's this?

115
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:27,925
他试图闯入监狱, 跟监察员说话
He tried to break in and speak with the Examiner.

116
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:29,742
这个 Dalek 在干什么?!
What is the Dalek doing?!

117
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:33,193
我以为你知道. 好像是应急电源什么的
I thought you knew.
Something to do with the emergency power supply.

118
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:37,498
啊, 不! 这是... 这是个伎俩! 我没有要求安装这个!
Ah, no! It's... it's a trick! I didn't ask for it!

119
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:39,200
Lesterson, 我都收到报告了.
Lesterson, I've had reports.

120
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:40,633
你在做什么?!
What are you doing?!

121
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:49,847
执行-你的-命令-铺设-应急-电源. 主人
Laying the new emergency power supply as you ordered, master.

122
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,312
这... 这是个谎言!
It... it... it's a lie!

123
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:54,215
我已经收到报告了, 说的就是你出现了一些不可理喻的行为
I've had reports of your incomprehensible behaviour.

124
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:59,292
是的. 是的, 我... 我能解释 - 不过你得把那东西赶开!
Yes. Yes, I... I can explain - if you'll get rid of that!

125
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:01,072
结束吧
Finish now.

126
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:08,918
我-是-你的-仆人
I am your servant.

127
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:15,365
总督在哪里?!
Where is the Governor?!

128
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:16,324
在下面巡视呢. 问这个干什么?
At the perimeter. Why?

129
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:20,908
给他打电话! 让他尽快赶回来! 我们现在处于可怕的危险当中!
Call him! Get him back here as quickly as possible!
We're all in terrible danger!

130
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:24,608
监察员是对的! 一直都是对的!
The Examiner was right! Right all the time!

131
00:09:25,427 --> 00:09:27,041
别听她要说的任何话!
Don't listen to anything she has to say!

132
00:09:27,255 --> 00:09:27,828
过来吧
Come along now.

133
00:09:28,113 --> 00:09:29,521
她跟 Daleks 是一伙的!
She's in league with the Daleks!

134
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:33,963
现在, 现在, Lesterson. 我们冷静一点处理, 你现在看起来不太好
Now, now, now, now. Please, Lesterson.
Let's just take things calmly, you're not well.

135
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,087
我好得不能太好了!
I'm perfectly well!

136
00:09:35,322 --> 00:09:42,227
打住 Lesterson, 打住. 现在, 你应该在医院待着. 你答应我你到那里后向我报告
Please Lesterson, please. Now, you ought to be in hospital.
You promised me you'd report there.

137
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:43,654
我才不答应这样的事情!
I promised nothing of the kind!

138
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,580
你难道不记得了? 算了. 我理解
Don't you remember? Never mind. I understand.

139
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,278
唔. 遗憾. 期望只是暂时的
Hmm. Pity. It's probably only temporary.

140
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:57,722
你是想说我疯了!
You're trying to say I'm mad!

141
00:09:57,987 --> 00:09:59,406
呵呵, 不不, 不是疯了
No. No, not mad.

142
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:01,053
不是. 当然不是
No. Of course not. No.

143
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,983
不过我告诉你, 我看见了, Daleks 在自我复制! 我看见了! 我发誓!
But, I tell you, I saw the Daleks! They were duplicating!
I saw it! I swear to you!

144
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:11,053
他突然就开始在实验室说这些胡言乱语. 我... 我怕他是..
He suddenly started saying these things in the lab.
I'm... I'm afraid, he's...

145
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:12,371
噢, 不 ! 不!
Oh, no! No!

146
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:16,204
看住他吧.
Keep him under restraint.

147
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:20,200
噢, 没有人听进去我的话?!
Oh, will nobody listen to me?!

148
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:24,875
把那个起子递给我
Pass me that small screwdriver.

149
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:29,749
我做不到. 我的手被捆住了 .  再说了, 即使我能做到, 我也不会帮你
I can't. My hands are tied.
Anyway, I wouldn't help you, even if I could.

150
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:30,686
OK.

151
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:34,909
还有? 我都干不过来了
More? I can't handle them.

152
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:36,222
那是你的份额
This is the lot.

153
00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:40,326
听.  Dalek 已经走了
Listen. The Dalek's gone now.

154
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:41,899
那并不意味着你可以说话了
That doesn't mean you can start talking.

155
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:44,136
噢, 让她一边待着, Kebble. 她不会有什么危害
Oh, leave her alone, Kebble. She isn't doing any harm.

156
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:49,216
你以为你是个硬汉吗? 不是, 也就能把一个女孩推来推去. 我倒期望你像个硬汉一样站出来
You think you're very tough don't you, pushing a girl around.
I'd like to see you come up against a real man.

157
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,015
比如说谁?
Like who?

158
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,247
比如说 Ben
Like Ben, for instance.

159
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:53,416
别替他操心了. We've got him safely stowed away. FIXME
Don't worry about him. We've got him safely stowed away.

160
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,052
你们抓了 Ben?
You've got Ben?

161
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:58,337
他可得好好睡一觉.
He's sleeping off a slight fall.

162
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,964
我跟你说了让她一边待着
I told you to leave her alone.

163
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:05,383
你的名字是 Valmar, 对吧?
Your name's Valmar, isn't it?

164
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:06,407
不假
That's it.

165
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:11,736
你想要让 Daleks 去跟总督斗。但你看不出来吗, 它们也会攻击你们的
You want the Daleks to fight the Governor.
But don't you see? They'll turn on you, too.

166
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:13,517
什么? 那三个胡椒小罐?
What? Three big pepper pots?

167
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:17,894
其中一个把 Resno 杀死了. 你们也都看到了 Dalek 对着金属板开火是什么场景
One of them did kill Resno.
You saw what the Dalek did to that sheet of metal.

168
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,094
而且那还只是个开始
And that's just the beginning.

169
00:11:19,274 --> 00:11:21,615
别听她的, 她要把你带到监察员那个阵营
Don't listen to her. She's giving you the Examiner's line.

170
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:28,557
他不是监察员. 我们只是旅行者, 因为故障降落在这里了.
He isn't the Examiner. We're just travellers. Landed here by accident.

171
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:34,650
博士, 也就是你们以为的监察员, 他发现真正的监察员死了, 就把他的徽章捡起来了
The Doctor - that's the man you think is the Examiner
- found the real Examiner dead, and picked up his papers.

172
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:39,915
你们的这个博士, 他知道 Daleks 的一些情况?
This Doctor of yours. He knows something about the Daleks?

173
00:11:40,256 --> 00:11:43,790
他试图警告每一个人. 这是我们留在这里的唯一原因
He tried to warn everyone. It's the only reason we stayed here.

174
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:49,940
什么-时候-干完-这个?
When will the work be completed?

175
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,360
我不知道. 我需要连接盒, 跟这个类似的
I don't know. I'll need a new junction box like this one.

176
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,179
你们全都低估了这些个 Daleks.
You've all underestimated these Daleks.

177
00:12:02,364 --> 00:12:04,047
大脑比我们厉害, 我估计
Better brains than us, I suppose.

178
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:09,423
我只知道一些博士告诉我的 - 他说它们能够终结整个文明
I only know what the Doctor has told me
- he says they're capable of exterminating whole nations.

179
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:13,441
也许吧, 但在我们接管之后, 它们杀死我们有什么好处呢 - 我们对 Daleks一直很友好
Perhaps, but what would they want to kill us for
- after we've taken over. We're friendly with the Daleks.

180
00:12:13,604 --> 00:12:17,588
但你没看出来? 人类不可能跟 Daleks 做朋友. 它们没有朋友
But, don't you see? Human beings can't be friends with Daleks.
They don't have friends.

181
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:18,889
我不明白为什么不能
I don't see why not.

182
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:25,217
它们有一种仇恨, 仇恨任何跟它们不一样的东西. 它们认为它们更高级
It's a kind of hatred for anything unlike themselves.
They think they're superior.

183
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:28,855
这女孩说的有些道理
The girl's got something.

184
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,139
你想要告诉 Janley 吗? 欢迎你来!
You want to tell Janley? You're welcome!

185
00:12:31,323 --> 00:12:35,160
Janley! 她一有机会就会背叛你们中的大多数
Janley! She'll betray the lot of you, if she gets the chance.

186
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,014
另一个-连接盒-在-外面
The other junction box is outside.

187
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:40,925
谢谢你
Thank you.

188
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:46,382
太多话了, 是吧? 你不知道说到 Janley 他心肠就软了
Talk too much, don't you? Didn't you know he was soft on Janley?

189
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,932
没事, 没事, 我只是不想让她走向邪路.
All right, all right, I'm just putting her straight.

190
00:12:49,424 --> 00:12:50,617
电缆方面我们进展太慢了
More slack on the cables.

191
00:13:10,463 --> 00:13:12,216
到处布的这些都是什么线缆?
What are all these cables lying about?

192
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:13,908
新的应急供电线路
New emergency power supply.

193
00:13:14,095 --> 00:13:15,223
那是谁的主意?
Who's idea was that?

194
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,474
你想知道这个干什么?
What do you want to know for?

195
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:19,947
我要知道...?! 你不知道我是总督?
What do I...?! Don't you know I'm the Governor?

196
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:21,533
你从哪里来的?
Where are you from?

197
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:22,529
内务部, 先生
The interior, sir.

198
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:25,543
内务部? 为什么带枪?
The interior? Why are you carrying a gun?

199
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,679
我是 Bragen 安保小队的队长, 先生
I'm a Squad Leader in Bragen's guard, sir.

200
00:13:29,235 --> 00:13:35,135
哦, 明白了. Bragen 的保安, 嗯? 好吧, 继续拿着吧.
Oh, I see. Bragen's guard, eh? All right, carry on.

201
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,759
Cut that row out, 你们俩!
Cut that row out, you two!

202
00:14:01,376 --> 00:14:01,990
停下.
Stop that.

203
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,096
噢!
Oh!

204
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:11,614
Come on.
Come on.

205
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:12,582
等一下!
Wait a minute!

206
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:19,240
我可不想让他也来尝试这个方法 - 虽然他看起来也不像是个懂音调的人
We don't want him trying it,
although he seemed a bit tone deaf to me.

207
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:44,466
唉, Bragen - 这一趟趟的似乎越来越吃力了
Well, Bragen - these trips are becoming more and more demanding.

208
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:46,077
没想到你会出现, 总督
I didn't expect you, Governor.

209
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:50,278
啊, 再往外跑我就有点受不了了. 怎么样? 这里发生了什么?
Ah, I had as much as I could stand.
Well? What's been happening here?

210
00:14:50,985 --> 00:14:51,834
等会儿.
One moment.

211
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,471
我问你问题呢, 伙计.
I asked you a question, man.

212
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:54,816
我听见了.
I heard you.

213
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,883
嘿, 你的工作可以先放放. 明天转交回我就行了. 我想听听监察员的情况.
Look, your work can wait. You can hand over to me tomorrow.
I want to hear about the Examiner.

214
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:06,067
监察员目前在监狱里.
The Examiner is at present in jail.

215
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,448
在监狱? 这样很危险, 不是吗? 谁把他投进去的?
In jail? That's rather dangerous isn't it? Who put him there?

216
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:12,254
我干的.
I did.

217
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:14,486
你干的? 天啦, 为什么?
You did? In heaven's sake, why?

218
00:15:14,684 --> 00:15:17,982
他是个假冒的, 总督. 还很可能是个谋杀犯
He's an impostor, Governor. Possibly a murderer as well.

219
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,982
我们刚在水银沼泽里面发现了真监察员的尸体.
We have just discovered the body of the real Examiner in the mercury swamp.

220
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:26,996
我期望你说的情况都是事实, Bragen.
I hope you're sure of your facts, Bragen.

221
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:27,930
相当确定.
Quite sure.

222
00:15:28,781 --> 00:15:32,374
这可能会有长远的后果.
This could have far-reaching consequences.

223
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:36,837
就我所知, 这没什么需要补充的了. 如果没有其它事情...
As far as I am concerned, there's nothing more to be said.
So if there's nothing further...

224
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:41,946
没有其它! 你以为你在跟谁说话? 跟我说话的时候站起来!
Nothing further! Who the devil do you think you're talking to?
Stand up when you're speaking to me man!

225
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:45,445
我更愿意继续坐着.
I prefer to remain seated.

226
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:49,496
是吗?! 我们就来看看. 保安!
Do you now?! We'll soon see about that. Guards!

227
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:51,977
把这个人带出我的办公室.
Take this man out of my office.

228
00:15:53,355 --> 00:15:55,479
你们没有听见我说的吗? 这是命令!
Did you hear what I said? That's an order!

229
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,698
你忘记了, 我亲爱的 Hensell. 他们不是你的保安 - 他们是我的.
You forget, my dear Hensell. They're not your guards - they're mine.

230
00:15:58,856 --> 00:15:59,880
我是总督!
I am the Governor!

231
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:04,772
不. 现在不是了. 我才是.
No. Not now. I am.

232
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:11,787
哦, 我明白了. 你的保安, 呃? 是了, Quinn 警告过我关于你的保安的事情
Oh, I see. Your guards, eh? Yes, Quinn warned me about your guards

233
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:15,787
但我们都没太重视? 不过我们很快可以纠正过来.
But we all took them too lightly, didn't we? But we'll soon change that.

234
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:26,618
你这个蠢人! 如果人们听说我在自己的首府被囚禁起来了, 你那几个保安还能自由多久?!
You imbecile! How long do you think your handful of guards can hang out
when the people hear that I am being kept a prisoner in my own capital?!

235
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,386
他们只会按照我们告诉他们的情况做出反应, Hensell.
The people will do exactly as they are told, Hensell.

236
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:35,143
当然, 如果你与我们合作的话, 事情会更容易一点.
It will, of course, be easier for them if you co-operate with us.

237
00:16:53,486 --> 00:16:56,937
等着. 保安, 你们可以出去了.
Wait there. Guards, dismissed.

238
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:06,005
怎样, Bragen, 你需要我的合作, 对吧?
So Bragen, you want my co-operation, do you?

239
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:11,036
这样能少流些血. 我甚至可以让你继续留着总督的头衔.
It would save bloodshed.
I might even let you keep the title of Governor.

240
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:18,708
你会吗?! 我来告诉你你将会做什么. 你让你的保安都解除武装, 立即逮捕你自己!
Might you now?! I'll tell you what you will do.
You'll order your guards to disarm and place yourself under arrest immediately!

241
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:23,943
这么说你拒绝我的提议? 我还觉得在当前情形下这是个挺慷慨的提议呢.
So you reject my offer? I thought it a generous one in the circumstances.

242
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:26,710
当前什么情形?
What circumstances?

243
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:27,645
看看这个.
Look at this.

244
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:29,874
这是什么?
What is it?

245
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:32,422
这就是为什么这个基地现在是我的.
The reason that the colony is now mine.

246
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:39,604
这是某种武器?
Is it a weapon of some kind?

247
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:44,368
我给你安排一个演示吧. 你还是拒绝我的提议吗?
I'll arrange a demonstration for you. Do you still refuse my offer?

248
00:17:44,966 --> 00:17:47,354
我不会妥协的.
I will not be intimidated.

249
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:54,399
当然不. 执迷不悟啊, Hensell. 杀了他!
Of course not. In character to the last, Hensell. Kill him!

250
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:10,583
为什么-人类-杀死-人类?
Why do human beings kill human beings?

251
00:18:10,802 --> 00:18:11,838
去干你的活去!
Get on with your work!

252
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:14,618
是的-主人  我-服从.
Yes, master. I obey.

253
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:25,124
是的, 服从我! 从现在开始, 我要每个人都要绝对服从!
Yes, obey me! From now on,
I will have complete obedience from everyone!

254
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:35,577
现在我还得检查一下线缆回路. 否则的话, it's just as you asked for.
I'll have to check the cable circuit now.
Otherwise, it's just as you asked for.

255
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:37,731
很-好.
Very well.

256
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:41,809
为什么你们不直接利用你从基地抽取到的能量呢? 费这个劲做什么?
Why can't you carry on with the power you're drawing
from the colony? Why go to all this trouble?

257
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:48,416
到目前-为止, 我们-还是-要用-基地-电力-充电
Until now, we have had to recharge from the colony supply.

258
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:54,416
采用-静电, Daleks-将会-加倍-有用.
With static power, the Daleks will be twice as useful.

259
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:55,354
Valmar, 快点!
Valmar, quick!

260
00:18:55,688 --> 00:18:56,187
怎么回事?
What's the matter?

261
00:18:56,366 --> 00:18:56,897
总督回来了.
The Governor's back.

262
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:57,780
这女孩儿怎么办?
What about the girl?

263
00:18:57,973 --> 00:18:58,545
别管她了.
Leave her.

264
00:18:58,912 --> 00:18:59,764
我-要-跟着-你.
I will follow you.

265
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:00,668
为什么?
What for?

266
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:03,040
我-是-你的-仆人.
I am your servant.

267
00:19:03,802 --> 00:19:04,286
得了吧.
Come on.

268
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:17,826
他们自己的静电供电线路! 我好奇我们还有多少时间?
An electrical circuit of their own supplying static electricity!
I wonder how much longer we've got?

269
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:21,598
我没有意识到他们将有自己的供电线路.
I didn't realise they'd have a circuit of their own.

270
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,309
博士, 快看!
Doctor, look out!

271
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,830
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

272
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:43,779
做得好! 刚才出去的那个人是谁?
Well done! Who was the man who went outside just now?

273
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,688
Valmar. 他一直在给 Daleks 干活.
Valmar. He's been working for the Daleks.

274
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,947
搭建他们的静电供应系统.
On their static power supply.

275
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:48,091
Doctor, 他们抓了 Ben.
Doctor, they've got Ben.

276
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,787
是的, 我知道. 他跑出来是为了让我... 噢, 这就说来话长了
Yes, I know. He ran away so that I could...
Oh well, it's a long story

277
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:53,787
不过别担心. 那小子可以照顾他自己!
But don't worry. That boy can take care of himself!

278
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,507
你听到了吗? That won't help.
Did you hear that? That won't help.

279
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,461
出去! 你们全部!
Get out! All of you!

280
00:19:56,615 --> 00:19:57,392
你怎么办?!
What about you?!

281
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,307
但是, 博士! 噢...
But Doctor! Oh...

282
00:19:58,585 --> 00:19:59,193
走!
Go!

283
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:25,300
他们-逃跑-了吗?
Have they escaped?

284
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:29,275
是的-回到-舱内-然后-报告.
Yes, return to capsule and report.

285
00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:30,946
我-服从.
I obey.

286
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:52,849
我们-在-这里-等待-直到-人类-自己-内部-打起来.
We are to wait here until the human beings fight among themselves.

287
00:20:53,158 --> 00:20:55,234
然后-我们-将会-攻击.
Then we will strike.

288
00:20:55,515 --> 00:21:15,466
然后-终结! 终结! 终结! 终结!  ...
And exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! ...

289
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,834
一个来可以救我们的人.
The one man who could have saved us.

290
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:22,511
别担心, 人们也会跟随你的.
Don't worry, the people will follow you, too.

291
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:27,033
也许吧. 但 Hensel 没有太多 there wasn't any maybe about Hensell.
Maybe. But there wasn't any maybe about Hensell.

292
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:33,733
他是个传统的人. 有点单纯, 但为这个基地做了很多了不起的工作.
He was old-fashioned. Single-minded,
yes, but he's done a lot of wonderful work for this colony.

293
00:21:33,974 --> 00:21:40,033
但结果事与愿违. 为什么? 为什么他会被杀?
Events turned out against him, that's all.
But why? Why was he killed?

294
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,124
我能回答这个.
I can answer that.

295
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:44,758
他想要销毁 Daleks, 所以其中一个就杀死了他.
He wanted to destroy the Daleks, so one of them killed him.

296
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:51,058
现在, 我宣布戒严令. 你将返回监狱, 这次会被好好看守住.
Now, I'm declaring martial law. You will be returned to prison,
and properly guarded this time.

297
00:21:51,237 --> 00:21:54,459
戒严令! 你觉得这对于对付 Daleks 有什么作用?
Martial law! What good do you think that will do against the Daleks?

298
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:56,562
Daleks 会听命于我
The Daleks will do as I tell them.

299
00:21:57,844 --> 00:21:59,659
那我们就看看吧, 看吧
We shall see, shan't we.

300
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:00,929
把他们带走.
Take them away.

301
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:19,164
终结 ! 终结 ! 终结 !
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!

302
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,955
指令-已收到. 终结所有人类!
Orders received. Exterminate all humans!

303
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:24,441
终结所有人类!
Exterminate all humans!

304
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:30,712
终结 ! 灭绝! 摧毁 ! Daleks-征服-并摧毁!
Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy!
