00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:27,724
继续走!
Move on!

15
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:28,658
有 Dalek!
The Dalek!

16
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:29,632
那怎么了?
What about it?

17
00:01:29,815 --> 00:01:30,748
你看不出来他是有武器的?
Can't you see it's armed?

18
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:32,042
继续前进!
Keep moving!

19
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:36,464
这个-区域-已经-禁止.
This area is restricted.

20
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:37,722
谁授权的?
On whose authority?

21
00:01:37,912 --> 00:01:38,772
安静!
Silence!

22
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,272
重复. 这个-区域-已经-禁止.
Repeat. This area is restricted.

23
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,623
服从-否则-你们-会被-毁灭.
Obey or you shall be exterminated.

24
00:01:48,883 --> 00:01:50,122
我以为是它们服从我们?
I thought they obeyed us?

25
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:51,702
我们现在怎么办, Doctor?
What do we do now, Doctor?

26
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:54,269
这边走.
This way.

27
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:07,229
他们-会被-毁灭.
They will be exterminated.

28
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:11,393
我们已经赢了. 革命已经结束了. 我将传话给 Valmar, Kebble 和其他人.
We've won. The revolution's over.
I'll pass the word to Valmar, Kebble and the rest.

29
00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:15,032
等等. 革命还没完全结束.
Wait. The revolution is not quite over yet.

30
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,879
我们还要做什么? Hensell 已经死了, 你成了新总督. 战斗也结束了.
What more can we do? Hensell's dead,
you're the new Governor. The battle's over.

31
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:27,618
不完全. 你提到了 Kebble, Valmar 等一群人. 他们必须要处理掉.
Not quite. You mentioned Kebble, Valmar and that rabble.
Well now they must be dealt with.

32
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:29,451
但那是我们的人.
But those are our own men.

33
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,644
呵, 呵. 当然.
Huh, huh. Of course.

34
00:02:31,877 --> 00:02:33,070
我不明白.
I don't understand.

35
00:02:33,665 --> 00:02:37,706
如果这群闹事的人放任自流的话, 你觉得我可能是安全的吗?
Do you think I can ever be secure in that chair
while that rabble are still loose?

36
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:44,706
他们昨天反叛的是 Hensell, 明天就可能轮到我了. 算了, 让他们闹事吧.
They rebelled against Hensell yesterday.
Tomorrow it'll be my turn. Well, let them rebel.

37
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:50,706
跟他们说保安已经掌握控制权了, 让他们进攻, 然后我们就可以镇压他们, 一举歼灭!
Tell them the guards have taken control.
Let them attack, and then we can crush them, utterly!

38
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,488
你说了＂我们＂.
You say "we".

39
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:59,274
是的. 我们一路走了这么久, 你和我. 你现在要回那边去吗?
Yes. We've come a long way together you and I.
You going to back down now?

40
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,528
你不能仅仅只是逮捕他们吗?
Couldn't you just arrest them?

41
00:03:02,757 --> 00:03:05,127
所有人必须死.
Everyone must be killed.

42
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:08,841
他们必须全部都被屠杀掉?
Must they all be slaughtered?

43
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:09,987
他们全部.
All of them.

44
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:16,053
哦, 你跟我还是一条心吗?
Well, are you still with me?

45
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:18,848
我觉得是.
I suppose so.

46
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:24,925
那就按我说的做. 我很高兴你同意我的意见.
Then do as I say. I'm glad you agreed with me.

47
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:38,827
现在!
Now!

48
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,534
你把我带来这里做什么?
What have you brought me in here for?

49
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:46,508
安静!
Quiet!

50
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,413
你到底是属哪边的?
Whose side are you on anyway?

51
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:52,922
我想我以前属于要得胜的一边.
I thought I was going to be on the winning side.

52
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:54,025
怎么改变主意了?
What changed your mind?

53
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:58,982
Bragen. 这个基地对他来说太小了. 他现在不想要任何人挡他的道.
Bragen. The colony's become too small for him.
He wants us out of the way now.

54
00:03:59,176 --> 00:04:01,945
是的, 这种事最后经常是这样, 伙计, 当你跟着他这样的家伙.
Yeah, well it often happens that way, mate,
when you follow blokes like him.

55
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:06,292
看, 我要去试着把你的朋友们找来, 尽我所能. 你等在这里.
Look, I'm going to try and get your friends here,
if I can. So wait here.

56
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:20,754
总督 Bragen, 一号区域报告.
Station One reporting, Governor Bragen.

57
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,521
说.
Yes.

58
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,689
叛乱分子正在集结, 我们正在密切注意事态.
The rebels are gathering. We've got them under observation.

59
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:29,561
别让他们聚集成大的群组. 在他们组织起来前进行打击. 现在他们马上就要有所行动了.
Don't let them concentrate in large groups. Hit them before
they organise.They'll be making their move any time now.

60
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:30,322
好的.
Right.

61
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:41,929
Vulcan 人民请注意. 现在是你们的新总督在讲话
People of Vulcan. This is your new Governor talking to you

62
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:46,929
我不得不告知大家总督 Hensell 已经被叛乱分子谋杀了
I have to announce that Governor Hensell has been murdered by the rebels.

63
00:04:47,606 --> 00:04:54,129
我已经暂时获得了控制权, 直到秩序恢复. 住在卫星城和内城的群众请保持冷静
I have taken control temporarily, until order is restored.
People living on the perimeter and in the interior can stay calm.

64
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:58,981
我们已经知道凶手是谁. 我一旦获知任何消息, 将尽可能及时知会大家
We know who the murderers are. 
I shall keep you informed of events as soon as I am able

65
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:02,981
所以请留意你们的通讯设备中的信号. 广播结束.
So listen for the signal to watch your communication sets. That is all.

66
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:06,164
啊! 你在这里啊.
Ah! There you are.

67
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:06,861
Ben!
Ben!

68
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,812
我就知道你会没事的!
I knew you'd be all right!

69
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:08,783
Polly - 你还好吧?
Polly - you okay?

70
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:09,528
噢, 是的.
Oh, yes.

71
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:10,690
Valmar 去找你们了, 碰到了吗?
Did Valmar find you, then?

72
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:11,491
Valmar? 没有.
Valmar? No.

73
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:13,121
又有 Valmar 什么事?
What's this about Valmar?

74
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:16,509
是这样, 看起来 Bragen 已经疯狂了. 他故意让叛乱分子起来闹事, 然后他好再把他们消灭掉.
Well it seems Bragen's gone power-mad.
He wants the rebels to revolt, then he can finish them off.

75
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:20,564
Daleks 不会在乎跟谁打. 他们会毁灭这个星球上的每一个人.
The Daleks won't care who they fight.
They'll exterminate every human being on this planet.

76
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:23,548
Doctor, 求你了, 我们回到 TARDIS 去吧.
Doctor, please let's go back to the TARDIS.

77
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,369
Quinn. 看住他们俩.
Quinn. Keep them both here.

78
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:26,788
喂, 等一下, 博士!
Well, wait a minute, Doctor!

79
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:28,981
好吧, 好吧. All right.
All right. All right.

80
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:31,214
现在你觉得他要干什么?
Now what do you think he's up to?

81
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:36,198
命令-已收到. Daleks-开始-终结!
Orders received. Daleks commence extermination.

82
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,520
终结！ 终结！ 终结！
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!

83
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,867
等一下, 监察员.
Just a minute, Examiner.

84
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:53,380
好了. 停住!
All right. Hold it!

85
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:55,873
都趴下!
Down everyone!

86
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:20,458
别往前走了.
Don't come any nearer.

87
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:21,727
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

88
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,580
我无意中听到你跟 Bragen 的谈话
I overheard your conversation with Bragen.

89
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,280
但你们是没法站起来对抗 Daleks的, 因此你们的计划将会落空.
But you can't stand up to the Daleks,
so your plan will come to nothing.

90
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:29,965
不是我的计划 - 是 Bragen 的.
Not my plan - Bragen's.

91
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:30,980
但那是一回事.
But that's the same thing.

92
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:31,783
不再是了.
Not any more.

93
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:33,976
你期望我能相信?
You expect me to believe that?

94
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:42,318
Val, 他当时也想杀了我的. 我来这里是要做你已经做了的事情.
Look Val, he was going to kill me too.
I came here to do exactly what you've done.

95
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:46,318
让 Bragen 看看 Daleks 到底是怎样的东西. 他不知道它们有多强悍.
Let Bragen see what the Daleks are like.
He doesn't know how strong they are.

96
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:47,995
必须得有人阻止他.
He's got to be stopped.

97
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:53,367
你们-必须-带我们-去到-你们-人类-中间.
You will lead us to the middle of your party of human beings.

98
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,162
是.
Yes.

99
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,984
我们-将-战斗-为你们
We will fight for you.

100
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:01,156
相信我, Val, 这是救我们命的唯一方法.
Believe me, Val, it's the only way to save all our lives.

101
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,869
你知道那些 Daleks 在自我复制吗?
Did you know that the Daleks are duplicating?

102
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:04,808
是的.
Yes.

103
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:07,513
但是-我们-是-你们的-朋友.
But we are your friends.

104
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:09,931
我们-将要-服务于-你们.
We will serve you.

105
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:13,382
带-我们-去-你们-小组-中间.
Take us to the centre of your group.

106
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:14,842
我们能信任他们吗?
Can we trust them?

107
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:21,178
必须得! 保安们已经收到命令要把我们彻底消灭. 我们必须得利用 Daleks. 快来.
We must! The guards have orders to wipe us out.
We must use the Daleks. Come on.

108
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:32,747
博士!
Doctor!

109
00:07:33,024 --> 00:07:33,910
这个窗户. 能打开吗?
The window. Does it open?

110
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:34,626
我不知道.
I dunno.

111
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:37,079
最好能, 否则我们就完蛋了! 你快出去.
It had better, or we're done for! Out you go.

112
00:07:37,948 --> 00:07:40,089
啊!... 啊!... 发生了什么?
Ah!... Ah!... What's happening?

113
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:44,395
Daleks. 他们在走廊集结, 都快挤满了. 我们得回到 Lesterson 的实验室去.
The Daleks. They're teeming all over the corridors.
We've got to get back to Lesterson's lab.

114
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:03,405
现在是总督 Bragen 讲话. 一组叛乱分子试图占领基地
This is Governor Bragen speaking.
A group of rebels is attempting to take over the colony.

115
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:07,405
所有忠诚的市民有责任帮助保安抵抗他们.
It is the duty of all loyal citizens to help the guards resist.

116
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:11,405
请待在家里, 等待秩序恢复. 保持关注我的简报.
Stay in your homes. Order will be restored.
Listen to my bulletins.

117
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:16,667
叛乱分子正在利用 Daleks 反击我们的人!
The rebels are using the Daleks against our people!

118
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:21,004
那就回去战斗啊! 你跑到我这里来干什么? 你觉得你们的枪是干什么用的?
Well, get back and fight! Why do you come running to me?
What do you think your guns are for?

119
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:22,262
但是, 枪对它们不管用啊!
Well, the guns don't work against them!

120
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:23,368
回去, 打他们!
Get back and fight them!

121
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:51,462
那儿, 那儿!
There, and there!

122
00:08:56,446 --> 00:08:57,340
还有那儿!
Over there!

123
00:08:57,977 --> 00:09:00,258
不! 不! 那边! 那是我们的人!
No! No! Over there! They're our people!

124
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:01,164
把 Dalek 的枪卸了!
Cut the Dalek gun off!

125
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:05,311
不! 啊!...
No! Ah!...

126
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:07,251
跟你说把他们的枪卸了!
I told you to cut the gun off!

127
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:07,972
已经切断了啊!
I did!

128
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:09,582
你杀死了我们自己的人!
You've killed our own people!

129
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,883
我们必须得拆除它们的枪, 只能这样.
We have to dismantle the gun, that's all.

130
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:14,580
噢, 快看.
Oh, look at it.

131
00:09:16,631 --> 00:09:19,649
你们的-用途-已经-结束.
Your usefulness is over.

132
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:27,310
快来!
Come on!

133
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:32,170
快, Val. 快来!
Quick, Val. Come on!

134
00:09:35,004 --> 00:09:36,905
博士, 躲在这里太蠢了!
Doctor, it's stupid to hide in here!

135
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:39,098
那你想到走廊上去试试运气吗? 谢谢了.
Well, do you fancy your chances outside in the corridor? No thanks.

136
00:09:39,318 --> 00:09:40,438
肯定得有别的什么方法.
The answer must be here somewhere.

137
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,827
嘘!
Ssssh!

138
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:42,766
啊!...
Ah!...

139
00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:02,669
你们必须绝对安静. 它们知道当前的所有事情, 所有! 它们甚至知道你在想什么.
You must be absolutely quiet. They know everything that's going on.
Everything! They even know what you're thinking.

140
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:04,849
他们的能量从哪里来的, Lesterson?
Where do they get their power from, Lesterson?

141
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:13,243
啊, 我试过去切断电源, 但离我太远了. 神奇的生物啊, 你不得不佩服他们.
Ah, I tried to turn the power off. But they were miles ahead of me.
Marvellous creatures. You have to admire them.

142
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:14,966
但我们要去阻止它们!
But we've got to stop them!

143
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:20,909
哦, 干这事儿太晚了. 它们是一个新的种族, 明白不.
Oh, it's too late for that. They're the new species, you see.

144
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:28,709
开始从智人手中接管世界了. 人类终有这一天, 都结束了.
Taking over from homo sapiens. Man's had his day. Finished now.

145
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:41,039
静电-线路-就快-完成.
The static circuit is nearly complete.

146
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:45,608
马上-我们-可以-抛弃-正在-使用的-电能.
Soon we can abandon the power we are using.

147
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:53,852
人类-将要-被-毁灭.
The humans are being exterminated.

148
00:11:03,573 --> 00:11:05,773
你听到了吗? 它们要开始使用它们自己的能量!
Did you hear that? They're going to use their own power!

149
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:10,683
它们自己铺设的线缆. 我以前用过的方法就没法再用了.
The cables they laid. The trick I tried before won't work anymore.

150
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,478
哦, 如果那个方法不好使, 我们就完蛋了.
Oh, eh, if that's no good now, we're finished.
All we can do is marvel at the creatures who are taking our place.

151
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,878
我们所有能做的, 就是对着这些生物惊叹不已, 眼看着它们取代掉我们.

152
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:25,928
不!
No!

153
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:26,823
快!
Come on!

154
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:28,007
别犯傻 - 快走!
Don't be a fool - come on!

155
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:32,180
这边可以走，快来

156
00:11:42,904 --> 00:11:43,839
别怕, Polly.
Take it easy, Polly.

157
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:47,791
我们不能做点什么吗?! 他们在谋杀所有人, 一个接一个!
Can't we do anything?! They're murdering everybody, one by one!

158
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:50,620
都是你造成的. 一开始你为什么要给它们提供能量?
You've done all this. Why did you give them power in the first place?

159
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:57,113
哦, 我当时可以控制住的, 你看. 然后 Janley 找了她们的一个人
Well, I could control it, you see. And then Janley got one of her men

160
00:11:57,331 --> 00:12:02,113
- Valmar, 好像是这个名字 - 他安装了一个秘密线缆.
- Valmar, I think it was, yes - and he rigged up a secret cable.

161
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:05,813
那个线缆直接由基地电厂提供电力.
It's carrying power directly from the colony's supply.

162
00:12:06,513 --> 00:12:09,802
哪儿? 在哪儿, Lesterson?
Where? Where is it, Lesterson?

163
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:14,249
Valmar 是唯一能回答这个问题的人. 当然 Daleks 也能
Valmar's the only one who can answer that. Or the Daleks of course.

164
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:18,649
它们知道所有事情, 是的, 你问 Daleks 也可以.
They know everything. Yes, you should ask the Daleks.

165
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:21,771
那么我们必须找到 Valmar.
Then we must find Valmar.

166
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:24,052
不! 你留在这里照顾 Polly.
No! You stay here and look after Polly.

167
00:12:24,263 --> 00:12:26,900
我过去（过来，快点！啊----）
I'll go.

168
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,906
你必须舍她而去了, Valmar.
You'll have to leave her now, Valmar.

169
00:13:16,474 --> 00:13:18,190
她并不想你们想的那么坏.
She wasn't as bad as you think.

170
00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:22,807
Valmar! Dalek 的能量供应系统在哪儿?
Valmar! Where is the Dalek power.

171
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:24,413
趴下, 你们俩!
Get down, both of you!

172
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,201
Valmar! Dalek 的能量供应系统在哪儿?
Valmar! Where is the Dalek power supply?

173
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:49,048
我们必须阻止它们, Valmar. 她死了! 你做不了什么了!
We've got to stop them, Valmar. She's dead!
There's nothing you can do for her!

174
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:52,654
主线缆在舱体里面. 但你们做不了什么.
The main cable's inside the capsule.
But there's nothing you can do.

175
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:54,724
一定有某种方法可以切断能量供应.
There must be some way of cutting off the power.

176
00:13:54,884 --> 00:14:01,160
是什么让你觉得我会那样做? 我们需要一点时间. 我知道了! 找人牵制它们!
What makes you think I want to do that? We need more time.
I know. A diversion.

177
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:05,360
Bragen 的保安! 我们只能利用他们来让 Daleks 无暇估计我们. 你去找 Bragen.
Bragen's guards. We'll have to use them to keep the Daleks busy.
You go to Bragen.

178
00:14:05,642 --> 00:14:11,580
一分队? 你们的情况如何? 你们还在吗一分队?
Section One? Where's your report? Are you there Section One?

179
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:18,680
二分队? 二分队? 为什么不回答? 你们能听到吗二分队?
Section Two? Section Two? Why don't they answer?
Can you hear me Section Two?

180
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:24,480
三分队? 噢, 为什么他们不回话? 我是总督. 为什么他们不回话?
Section Three? Oh, why don't they answer?
I'm their Governor. Why don't they answer?

181
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:13,254
这里是 Bragen. 我现在同 Daleks 讲话.
This is Bragen speaking. I'm speaking to the Daleks.

182
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:20,154
Daleks, 听我说, 我是总督. 你们必须为我工作. 不要相信叛乱分子.
Daleks, listen to me. I am the Governor.
You must work for me. Do not trust the rebels.

183
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:24,354
我会给予你们想要的任何东西. 但请立即放下武器. 这里是总督在讲话.
I will give you whatever you want. But immobilise your guns.
This is the Governor speaking.

184
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:27,418
他是个蠢蛋, 居然想跟 Daleks 谈条件.
He's nuts, trying to talk to the Daleks.

185
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:42,769
Lesterson, 这个柜子里面是什么?
Lesterson, what's in that cupboard?

186
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:44,859
什么也没有, 里面是空的.
Nothing. It's quite empty.

187
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,625
正好, 来吧, Polly, 我们躲在这里面比较安全, 很好.
Well, come on, Polly, we'll be safe in there, love.

188
00:15:58,385 --> 00:16:01,104
你们听到我的话了没, Daleks?! 你们必须服从我的命令!
Do you hear me, Daleks?! You will obey my orders!

189
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:04,277
没用的, Bragen. Daleks 早就不服从你的命令了.
No use, Bragen. The Daleks have stopped obeying your orders.

190
00:16:04,469 --> 00:16:05,646
啊! 保安!
Ah! Guards!

191
00:16:05,891 --> 00:16:11,113
都死了! Daleks 杀死了他们. 你在内城里还有几个保安小队. 他们到这里要多久?
Dead! The Daleks have killed them. You still have your guard units
in the interior. How long will it take them to get here?

192
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:12,115
看情况.
That depends.

193
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:13,474
赶紧啊!
Well, get them!

194
00:16:13,644 --> 00:16:14,996
但他们也会被 Daleks 拦截住.
Well, they will be intercepted by the Daleks.

195
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:18,472
正是! 这会把它们从这里引开, 给博士去寻找对付它们的机会.
Exactly! It will draw them away from here
and give the Doctor a chance to deal with them.

196
00:16:18,661 --> 00:16:20,801
我拒绝让我的保安们去做牺牲.
I refuse to allow my guards to be sacrificed.

197
00:16:20,953 --> 00:16:25,456
那样的话 Daleks 会把这个基地所有的东西都毁掉.
In that case the Daleks will destroy everything on this colony.

198
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:35,278
保安. 我是 Bragen. 所有小组马上到首府报告
Guards. This is Bragen speaking.
All units will report immediately to the capital.

199
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,278
注意可能会遭遇造反的 Daleks.
Be prepared to face the rebel Daleks.

200
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,249
好了, 你满意了吧?
There. Are you satisfied?

201
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,644
我期望这能有作用.
I hope it works.

202
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:54,886
Ben! Polly!
Ben! Polly!

203
00:16:55,258 --> 00:16:56,758
博士, 你听到 Bragen 说的了吗?
Doctor, did you hear what Bragen said?

204
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:57,722
是的, 我听到了.
Yes, I did.

205
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,573
我只能期望 Daleks 都跑到保安那里去.
Well I only hope the Daleks do go for the guards.

206
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:01,687
好多 Daleks 刚才出去了.
A lot of the Daleks went out just now.

207
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:03,852
很好, 因为我们要进去. 快来 Valmar. _.
Good, because we're going inside. Come on Valmar. _.

208
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:14,503
Ben, 把那根闲置的线缆给我们. Polly, 你负责在门口放哨.
Ben, give us that spare cable over there.
Polly, keep watch at the door.

209
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:17,605
你知道你在做什么吧?
Well, you know what you're doing?

210
00:17:17,776 --> 00:17:18,515
我当然知道!
Of course I do!

211
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:21,098
嗯, 为什么你不直接把插头都拔掉, 这样不就都切断了?
Well, why can't you just take all the plugs out and cut the power off?

212
00:17:21,243 --> 00:17:23,023
因为我更喜欢按我的方法来!
Because I prefer to do it my way!

213
00:17:23,602 --> 00:17:24,644
小心!
Look out!

214
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:37,618
静电-能量-已经-储存. 我们-可以-拆除-人类-电力-系统.
Static power is being stored.
We can dismantle the human electric system.

215
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:41,069
Daleks-法律-已经-生效
The law of the Daleks is in force.

216
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:43,507
终结-所有-人类.
Extermination of humans.

217
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:49,007
我们的-线缆-已被-移动.
Our cables have been moved.

218
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:52,674
我可以告诉你们是谁干的!
And I could tell you who did it!

219
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:55,187
你-在-这里-干-什么?
What were you doing in there?

220
00:17:55,655 --> 00:17:57,855
我想帮助你们.
I want to help you.

221
00:17:58,087 --> 00:17:59,178
为什么?
Why?

222
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:04,448
我-是-你的-仆人.
I am your servant.

223
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:07,752
我们-不-需要-人类-现在
We do not need humans now.

224
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:13,030
啊, 这样的话, 你也不应该杀我. 是我给了你们生命.
Ah, then, but you wouldn't kill me. I gave you life.

225
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:15,944
是的, 你-给了-我们-生命.
Yes, you gave us life.

226
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:59,943
啊!... 啊!... 啊!... 啊!... 啊!... 啊!... 
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!...

227
00:19:02,137 --> 00:19:03,447
还有-两个...
There are two...

228
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:10,888
终结！啊!... 啊!... 终结！
Exterminate! Ah!... Ah!... Exterminate!

229
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,180
它怎么了?
What happened to it?

230
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:58,240
我不知道.
I don't know.

231
00:19:58,523 --> 00:20:01,184
看来你的朋友, 那个监察员, 获得了最终胜利.
It seems that your friend, the Examiner, was successful after all.

232
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:07,085
现在我要恢复这个星球的法律和秩序了.
Now I shall restore law and order on this planet.

233
00:20:07,258 --> 00:20:09,171
不是你的法律, Bragen. 一切已经结束了.
Not your law, Bragen. That's finished for good.

234
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:10,164
你要服从我, 否则...
You'll obey me, or...

235
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:13,312
你的日子已经结束了, Bragen. 现在没人再服从你了.
Your day is over, Bragen. No one will obey you now.

236
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,265
我仍然是总督, 而且你将...
I'm still the Governor, and you will...

237
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:17,949
Valmar.
Valmar.

238
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:25,089
他是个凶手.
He was a murderer.

239
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:27,527
流了够多的血了.
Enough of guns.

240
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:34,460
还有好多收尾的工作要做. 我们一起来重建吧. 损毁的程度怎样?
There's a lot of clearing up to be done.
We will rebuild together. What is the extent of the damage?

241
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:37,711
哦, 我不知道还能不能修好. 整个电力系统都...
Oh, I don't know if its repairable.
The whole electrical system.

242
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:44,511
你还好吧?
Are you all right?

243
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:46,124
哦, 他没事. The clot knocked himself out.
Oh, he's OK. The clot knocked himself out.

244
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,290
这是个奇迹. 你怎么做到的?
It's a miracle. How did you do it?

245
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:51,515
呃? 发生了什么? 我做了什么? 我做了什么?
Eh? What happened? What did I do? What did I do?

246
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:53,485
你摧毁了 Daleks, 那就是你做的!
You destroyed the Daleks, that's what you did!

247
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:55,057
没必要谦虚了.
No need to be modest about it.

248
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,190
是我干的?
Did I do that?

249
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,224
是的, 你知道的!
You know you did!

250
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:05,320
你用光了基地供电系统的电力 - 让它们过载了 - 炸掉了它们的临时静电电路. 干得不错啊?
You used the power from the colony's electric supply - overfed it
- and blew up their temporary static circuit. Well didn't you?

251
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:07,621
是我干的吗?
Did I do all that?

252
00:21:07,903 --> 00:21:12,502
你是阻止了 Daleks, 但你就没想到你对这个基地造成的损害吗?
You may have stopped the Daleks,
but have you any idea of the damage you've done to the colony?

253
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:14,587
哦. There was a blow back, was there?
Oh. There was a blow back, was there?

254
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:20,026
A blow back? 我们的电力供应被毁掉了! 可能需要数月我们才能让事情回归正常.
A blow back? Our power supply has been destroyed!
It'll be months before we can get things back to normal.

255
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:20,881
Valmar!
Valmar!

256
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:21,858
那太不幸了.
That is unfortunate.

257
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,706
但你必须得用这个方法吗?
But did it have to be this way?

258
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:25,276
我造成了很大的破坏, 是吧?
I did a lot of damage, did I?

259
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:26,534
得了.
Come on.

260
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:35,819
我觉得我们还是赶紧离开这里吧, 赶在他们送账单过来之前.
I think we'd better get out of here before they send us the bill.

261
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:49,378
我并没有期望有一个管弦乐团奏奏乐，但也不觉得一句“谢谢你”会伤害到谁
Well, I mean I didn't expect the brass bands to be playing,
but I wouldn't have thought a 'thank you' would have hurt anybody.

262
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:52,943
不过 Ben, 想想那些可怜的人 - 全都死了.
But Ben, think of all those poor people - all killed.

263
00:21:53,304 --> 00:21:56,689
我知道, 但是博士救了整个基地, 否则它早就被完全抹平了.
I know, but the Doctor saved the colony from being completely wiped out.

264
00:21:57,114 --> 00:21:57,808
嗯.
Hmmm.

265
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,583
吔, 他不是一直在警告他们, 是他们自己不听啊
Yeah, and he was telling them all along, but would they listen?

266
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:06,706
他向 Valmar 、Quinn 和所有人解释的时候，也没有显得很有说服力
Mind you, he wasn't very convincing when he was trying to
explain it to Valmar and Quinn and everybody.

267
00:22:06,923 --> 00:22:08,279
嗯, 是不太有,  是吧
No he wasn't, was he?

268
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:11,904
博士, 你的确知道自己在做什么, 对吧?
Doctor? You did know what you were doing, didn't you?
