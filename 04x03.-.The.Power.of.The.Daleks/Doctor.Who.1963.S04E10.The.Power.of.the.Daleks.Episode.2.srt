00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:06,605
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:42,954 --> 00:00:43,939
Doctor, look!

3
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:52,212
A light. A torch outside.

4
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:54,433
Did you see it?

5
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:55,536
Quickly Ben, quickly!

6
00:00:55,747 --> 00:00:56,654
What was it?

7
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,459
Can you answer me?

8
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:21,379
It was a sort of disembodied hand. A sort of claw. It was horrible!

9
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,853
No. No, there's nothing.

10
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:42,860
You were right - there were three Daleks.

11
00:01:44,415 --> 00:01:45,963
Do you know what it was?

12
00:01:54,755 --> 00:01:56,448
If there were three, who moved it?

13
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,819
Don't ask me. Lesterson?

14
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:01,184
But he hadn't opened the capsule.

15
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:04,405
Now he said he hadn't opened it. Lets get our facts straight.

16
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:07,305
Aha, excellent! Good thinking, good thinking.

17
00:02:09,537 --> 00:02:11,301
What, does that mean you think he's been inside?

18
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:13,732
Perhaps he's been experimenting on the Daleks? Ah.

19
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,288
But... but they're things I... I mean they're dead. They must be!

20
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:20,049
This light is dead. Now the watch!

21
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:24,533
Do you mean these things just need power?

22
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:38,148
Now, Lesterson's fanatic. The Governor's jealous of his own position. What does that suggest to you? Dunno. Hadn't thought about it. That all is not well with this colony. Add to that one Dalek!

23
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:40,764
Oh, blimey, you don't half make mountains, don't you? One Dalek?

24
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:44,233
Yes! All that is needed to wipe out this entire colony.

25
00:02:54,041 --> 00:03:00,178
Examiner? Examiner?

26
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:07,211
Bragen, don't you ever knock before you enter a room?

27
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:12,062
I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I was expecting to find the Examiner here - not you Quinn.

28
00:03:12,288 --> 00:03:17,229
Well, he's not here. You'll probably want to start snooping under the bed, so I'll leave you to it.

29
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:18,510
One moment.

30
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:20,507
Don't try your luck with me, Bragen.

31
00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:31,413
On the contrary, I'm trying to avoid trouble. The Governor gave express instructions that you were not to contact the Examiner - I find you here. I'm sure you can offer some suitable explanation.

32
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:33,565
I can. But not to you.

33
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:35,125
Before you go... Oh!

34
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,155
Don't ever try to block my way again.

35
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,232
Guard!

36
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:49,779
The Examiner is missing. He must be found immediately.

37
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:53,471
Of course, the real Doctor was always going on about the Daleks.

38
00:03:53,722 --> 00:03:54,550
Real Doctor?

39
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:57,573
Real Doctor? Oh, you mean the real Doctor.

40
00:03:57,884 --> 00:04:01,268
Yeah, now I've seen that claw thing, well, wouldn't want to shake hands with it, let's put it that way.

41
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:04,222
Doctor, look, if they're that dangerous, what are you going to do about it?

42
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:16,790
Save my breath. Would Lesterson listen? Uh, uh. Lesterson listen. Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen. Exercises the tongue. Try it! Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

43
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:21,078
Look, they think you're the Examiner, order them to destroy the Daleks! Well, chuck your weight about.

44
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:24,972
Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

45
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:26,727
Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

46
00:04:26,926 --> 00:04:28,267
What do you think you're doing in here?

47
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:29,870
Listen, listen...

48
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:32,304
Who gave you permission?

49
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,746
Read this! Aloud!

50
00:04:35,157 --> 00:04:36,779
Accord every access.

51
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:42,405
Exactly! It doesn't say 'except your laboratory' anywhere does it? Unless it's in micro-print.

52
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:44,175
I should have been asked first!

53
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:47,166
What was the first thing you noticed when you looked inside that capsule?

54
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:48,655
Well, th... th... the Daleks.

55
00:04:48,842 --> 00:04:49,711
You were astounded?

56
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:50,396
Yes.

57
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,114
Amazed?

58
00:04:51,346 --> 00:04:51,878
Yes.

59
00:04:52,075 --> 00:05:00,621
You didn't even give them a glance! Why? Because you'd been in there and seen them! Where is the third Dalek?

60
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:02,176
I don't know what you're talking about!

61
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:10,054
You opened up the capsule without permission. You found the inner contart... compartment containing three Daleks, you took one of them away and you hid it!

62
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:13,097
Hid it? What... what nonsense!

63
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:14,909
May I ask what all this is about?

64
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:20,313
We opened an inner compartment in the capsule, and Lesterson had already been in there.

65
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:21,788
I don't deny that.

66
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:23,033
And he's nicked a Dalek!

67
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:24,071
Dalek?

68
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:28,449
It's the name the Examiner has given to two metal creations that I've discovered inside the capsule.

69
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:29,870
And they're dangerous. Evil.

70
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:32,520
Lumps of metal! Quite inactive.

71
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:35,422
That's what you think, mate. If you'd seen...

72
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:47,467
I consider it's my duty as a scientist to... to examine and investigate these objects. Now please, all of you, keep out of my laboratory. Keep your hands off my experiments!

73
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:53,045
Those 'lumps of metal' - Daleks - I want them broken up, or melted down. Up, or down, I don't care which, but destroyed!

74
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:54,417
I refuse to allow it.

75
00:05:57,514 --> 00:05:59,896
I'm an Earth Examiner - I demand it.

76
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:01,506
You're exceeding your authority.

77
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:05,305
Perhaps we should ask the Governor about that? I wish to see him immediately!

78
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,569
That might be difficult.

79
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,454
But not impossible. Ben, Polly.

80
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:19,303
Could he stop the experiments?

81
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:29,012
I don't know. It's none of your business. You go and get Janley and then come back here. We haven't... haven't got any time to waste. Now go on man, quickly, quickly!

82
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:03,382
He won't stop me experimenting. There must be some way to bring you back to life - and I'm going to find it.

83
00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:07,335
And of course you do have the right of any access.

84
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,249
Which is why I have a badge which says so.

85
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:11,534
Lesterson watches over his ideas like a mother hen.

86
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:18,457
If there was a bomb under this floor timed to go off in five minutes, would you ask my permission before you ripped up the floorboards.. aha, fruit!

87
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,382
Thank you.

88
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:27,541
Examiner - It's up to you of course, but I'd advise a little discretion in your investigations. It's not a very good time, just now.

89
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:31,263
Thank you. With all these disturbances...

90
00:07:31,555 --> 00:07:32,230
Disturbances?

91
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:43,535
Yes, minor acts of sabotage, rebel cliques, secret newspapers, nothing important you understand, but it keeps the Governor busy. I have no doubt he'll tell you about it himself when I arrange your meeting with him.

92
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,713
When will that be?

93
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:50,851
Ah, he's going on a tour of the perimeter of the colony. I'll... I'll find out if he can see you before he goes.

94
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,221
Thank you.

95
00:08:01,283 --> 00:08:04,492
You know, it's little things like this that make it difficult to believe that you're the Doctor.

96
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,240
Ahh.

97
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:08,531
The other one, I mean. The proper one. Oh nuts, you know what I mean.

98
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:11,313
Nuts? Yes, certainly, here we are. Crackers?

99
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:15,567
You, my old china, are an out and out phoney!

100
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:20,304
China, yes, I went there once I believe. Met Marco Polo!

101
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:26,050
No, not China. China! China and plate, mate, friend.

102
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,729
Yes, Marco Polo a friend? I believe he was.

103
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:30,437
Don't listen to him, Doctor. I know who you are.

104
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:31,476
Shh!

105
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:50,982
Ah, it's a...

106
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:06,386
Well, well, a touch of the bugs. Microphones.

107
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,313
Someone's been listening to what we were saying!

108
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:12,969
Yes, so that's why you were messing about and talking nonsense!

109
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:13,948
I never talk nonsense!

110
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:14,855
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

111
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,854
Well, hardly never.

112
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,003
Well, they certainly believe in making us at home, don't they?

113
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:21,107
At first, I thought there might be more than one.

114
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:26,705
Here, I bet old Charlie Bragen did it!

115
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:27,533
Charlie?

116
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:29,148
Well Fred wouldn't suit him would it?

117
00:09:29,425 --> 00:09:33,129
If he did do it, do you think it was his own idea? I mean - he could have been under orders.

118
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:36,454
You mean from the Governor? Ah, I don't know. What do you think, Doctor?

119
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:46,701
Oh, yes. Yes of course. Let's... let's consider this button for a moment. It's the only clue we've got to the murderer of the Examiner. The real Examiner.

120
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:49,501
Hmm. And who asked for him to come?

121
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:52,718
Hmm. Well, Lesterson's crackers about that capsule. He wouldn't want anyone nosing about.

122
00:09:52,974 --> 00:09:55,102
Bragen said the Governor's been having trouble.

123
00:09:55,348 --> 00:10:00,444
Naw, rule him out. Governors are all the same, he wouldn't ask for help. If he sent the word it would look as if he couldn't do the job properly.

124
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:01,454
Yes.

125
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,622
Oh, well, I vote we go back to the TARDIS, I've had enough of this dump.

126
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:09,309
Have you? What about the Daleks?

127
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:10,672
Well, they're dead.

128
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:13,896
Well, what about that thing we saw in the capsule - that was alive all right.

129
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:15,980
Well, can't explain that.

130
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:20,795
I can. And that's why we have to stay!

131
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:29,474
Ugly-looking brutes aren't they? Hey, what's he want to muck about with them for? Leave well alone, that's what I say.

132
00:10:29,686 --> 00:10:35,407
You're a fine one to be a research assistant. Leave well alone? There'll be no progress on this planet with people like you around.

133
00:10:35,617 --> 00:10:45,042
We're doing all right as we are. Or we were until your lot came along stirring things up. You won't get away with it, you know. The Governor knows all about you rebels. He'll smash the lot of you when he's ready.

134
00:10:45,607 --> 00:10:46,198
Governor?

135
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:47,302
Yeah, the Governor!

136
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:48,171
He couldn't smash...

137
00:10:48,394 --> 00:11:08,754
Will you be quiet! Where do you both think you are? This is a scientific laboratory. Kindly keep your politics out of it. Come on, Resno. Man, get on with it. We haven't got all day. We've got to get this working before the Examiner stops us. He's got some phobia about these.. these Daleks?

138
00:11:09,806 --> 00:11:20,543
I know the misery they cause - the destruction. But there's something else more terrible - something I can only half remember.

139
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,890
Doctor, what was it?

140
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:30,612
Well? Where is the Governor? What did he say?

141
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,748
He sends his apologies Examiner. He can't see you tonight, but he hopes to see you first thing in the morning.

142
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:39,274
Well, it might not wait that long, Char... ah, Bragen.

143
00:11:39,544 --> 00:11:40,609
It will have to.

144
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:41,792
Excuse me.

145
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:43,165
Where are you going?

146
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,531
To see the Governor, of course.

147
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:50,848
I'm afraid that's not possible. Once his door is closed, no-one, not even you, Examiner, is allowed into his room!

148
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:55,448
Very well.

149
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:58,513
Thank you. Until the morning then.

150
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:04,696
What happens now?

151
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:13,503
I shall radio Earth. Governor or not, Hensell will have to listen to them - I'll get Earth to back me.

152
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:28,016
That's funny. I could have sworn. You stay here, I shan't be long.

153
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:39,577
Connecting now.

154
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,073
All connections responding.

155
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:46,291
Nothing at all?

156
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,257
No.

157
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:48,379
Are you sure?

158
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:49,477
There's nothing wrong here.

159
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:50,456
Well, let's see.

160
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:51,971
Really. If you can't trust me to read a dial.

161
00:12:52,256 --> 00:12:58,487
Be quiet. All right - we'll try again. This time we'll take it up to 3.24. Got that Janley?

162
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,951
3.24.

163
00:13:04,223 --> 00:13:05,245
It's moving!

164
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:22,622
Now, note this, Janley. Number one attachment with sucker stick responding. Number two attachment not moving. Number three attachment with lens responding. Watch these meters, Resno.

165
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:23,691
Still responding.

166
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:29,650
Now, it's reasonable to assume that this the sucker stick acts like some kind of a hand.

167
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:40,047
It's all right - don't be alarmed. We've only introduced temporary power. We shall have to be able to open it up before we could find how it works permanently.

168
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:41,596
It's a bit frightening.

169
00:13:41,895 --> 00:13:47,706
Yes. Now, I cannot think what this short stubby arm is for.

170
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:49,671
Could the lens attachment be an eye?

171
00:13:49,917 --> 00:14:08,257
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now it's quite possible that this, ah, Dalek... Now there must be some kind of directing influence. There may even be a simplified brain. Positronic, I shouldn't wonder. If only we could open it up!

172
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:11,838
Now what?

173
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,394
Everything functioning here.

174
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:17,785
Yes. Well, perhaps the power is leaking away somewhere. We'll... we'll try again.

175
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,678
Look at the eye-stick!

176
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:44,887
It's watching us!

177
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:46,152
Don't be absurd.

178
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:47,293
It was. I saw it!

179
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:55,571
You can't use the phrase 'watching us'. You'll have us believing that th... the thing has intelligence next. Now, get on with your work, man!

180
00:15:51,073 --> 00:15:52,259
I know you're there.

181
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,059
Examiner, thank goodness, it's you. I've been trying to talk to you ever since you got here.

182
00:15:57,261 --> 00:16:01,458
What's happening here? You again.

183
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:02,700
What do you want?

184
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:04,672
I found the operator unconscious.

185
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,173
So did I! I was just looking at him, when I heard someone move. It must have been you.

186
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:11,088
And those?

187
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:14,772
I picked them up. What is all this?

188
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:16,485
The cables have been cut.

189
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:17,509
What?

190
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:26,825
This is serious. It's not just our own communications. We're cut off from Earth as well.

191
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,859
The only people who'd want to do that are the rebels.

192
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,846
Those muscle boys of yours had any brains, they'd stop things like this.

193
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:38,500
Bragen, I was attacked just after I landed. This is a small souvenir I collected.

194
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:41,949
This button belongs to you, doesn't it?

195
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:43,324
Well, yes.

196
00:16:43,655 --> 00:16:47,431
And you say you picked these up? I suggest that you were sabotaging the communications...

197
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:48,246
That's a lie!

198
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:51,883
...having first attacked one of the engineers. I'd detain the Governor on evidence like that.

199
00:16:52,164 --> 00:16:54,402
I hope you're not thinking of detaining me, Bragen.

200
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:58,940
I've no option. I could hardly let you run around loose after this, could I? All right guards.

201
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,283
I warn you, Bragen!

202
00:17:03,074 --> 00:17:06,831
All right - you win this round, Bragen. We'll see what it looks like in front of the Governor.

203
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:13,462
The Governor will want an enquiry. May I ask what you were doing here?

204
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:26,218
Right. I've redirected power. This time working up to 4.68. Eh... now Resno, you will have to dodge between the camera and your meters.

205
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:27,386
Ready.

206
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,947
Connecting, now.

207
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,547
All connections responding.

208
00:17:35,843 --> 00:17:36,410
Excellent.

209
00:17:36,645 --> 00:17:37,389
It's working!

210
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:43,597
Excellent. Film it, film it now, Resno. And, note the readings, Janley.

211
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:48,910
It seems to be interested in you, Resno.

212
00:17:50,588 --> 00:17:51,895
What's the matter with you man?

213
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:56,905
I tell you it's intelligent. It's watching me, Lesterson. Weighing me up! I can sense it!

214
00:17:57,175 --> 00:17:58,050
Don't be a fool.

215
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,224
I don't like it I tell you. I don't know what these things can do.

216
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:06,216
No, and we never shall know, shall we, unless we take film of every reaction. Now get on with your work, man!

217
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:16,803
Resno!

218
00:18:23,606 --> 00:18:24,514
It's all right. He isn't dead.

219
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,575
What happened?

220
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:27,166
Knocked out by the shock waves.

221
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:32,028
We must get him to the hospital. I'll go and get help.

222
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,839
But we've got to defend Quinn.

223
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,051
Yeah, I know. He's innocent until he's proved guilty. But he is guilty.

224
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:14,656
He's the Deputy Governor!

225
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:21,628
So what? I had a headmaster once who got nicked for not paying his bus fare! And then there's the motive, don't forget the motive.

226
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:22,996
Like what for instance?

227
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:26,815
Well, he's the Deputy Governor, right? Maybe he wants to be Governor.

228
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:28,467
Oh, that's ridiculous!

229
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:35,024
Well, the jacket button wasn't! And he was caught red-handed in the Communications Room with a pair of pliers, and don't tell me he was plucking his eye-brows either.

230
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:38,817
Look, there are some people you know are all right. You just know by looking at them.

231
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,191
Good morning. The enquiry is about to begin. I've been sent to escort you.

232
00:19:46,246 --> 00:19:47,222
Hello Janley.

233
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:48,524
Is it time?

234
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:52,053
Yes. Yes, I think so. I feel quite excited.

235
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,792
So you should. It's a wonderful achievement.

236
00:19:54,011 --> 00:20:01,456
Yes, yes. But the wonderful thing, Janley, is that we don't know the full scope of this experiment. Who knows where we may go from here.

237
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:04,675
Who know what this Dalek may do?

238
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,935
It's harmless now?

239
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:12,005
Yes, yes, yes. I... I've removed... Oh, Resno, have you been to see him today?

240
00:20:12,362 --> 00:20:13,224
Yes, yes.

241
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:13,931
And?

242
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,252
He... he's had medical attention. He's going to be all right.

243
00:20:16,922 --> 00:20:17,302
Oh, good.

244
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:23,341
No one must find out about this accident. It might give the Examiner just the excuse they want, and he could stop the whole project.

245
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,882
Well, yes. Yes, yes, yes, you're right.

246
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,080
Well. Ready?

247
00:20:31,505 --> 00:20:34,076
Yes! Let's go and surprise them.

248
00:20:38,245 --> 00:20:55,201
I am sorry I couldn't see you earlier, Examiner. Please sit down. Well, Quinn, I don't like this anymore than you do. What have you been up to?

249
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:57,486
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

250
00:20:57,804 --> 00:21:01,870
Well, what about Bragen's report then? These are facts, Quinn. Now, what have you got to say about it?

251
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,067
Does the engineer say I hit him?

252
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:05,617
How could he if he was hit from behind?

253
00:21:05,826 --> 00:21:06,983
Then its only circumstantial evidence.

254
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:12,939
The Examiner was also attacked in the mercury swamp. We have a button from your jacket, found in the Examiner's hand.

255
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:15,137
I can't explain that.

256
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,398
I'm sure you can't!

257
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,715
Examiner.

258
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:20,488
You seem to be in two minds.

259
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,144
Yeah, and two bodies.

260
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:26,886
You mentioned to Bragen that these machines of Lesterson's... What do you call them?

261
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,948
I call them what they are - Daleks.

262
00:21:29,196 --> 00:21:33,697
Ah, yes, yes, yes, Daleks. You say they could be a motive for destroying our communications.

263
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,759
I do.

264
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:37,375
Lesterson, this is a special enquiry. Now please.

265
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,589
This won't wait. You won't be disappointed!

266
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:41,020
You heard what I said Lesterson!

267
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:45,982
Governor, I've just completed a... an experiment which could revolutionise the whole colony. Bear with me.

268
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,379
Lesterson, what have you done? What have you done?

269
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:52,034
I'll show you. Janley, now!

270
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,250
It recognised the Doctor. It recognised him.

271
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:32,792
What's the matter, Doctor? Are you all right?

272
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,332
The fools. The stupid fools.

273
00:22:36,744 --> 00:22:39,352
You're scared! What can it do?

274
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:40,981
Nothing yet.

275
00:22:41,354 --> 00:22:43,764
It knew who you were! It sounds crazy, but it did.

276
00:22:44,024 --> 00:22:44,865
Knew who I was.

277
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:46,532
The Dalek knows who you are.

278
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:55,337
This creation is called, I understand, a Dalek. Now, look at it. I have merely given it electrical power. But it is capable of storing it. Moreover, it responds to orders. Turn around.

279
00:23:00,273 --> 00:23:02,407
Move that chair.

280
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:22,830
Stop. You see? Well, just think what this could do for our... our mining program, our processing, packaging. Dozens of labour jobs, Governor. It may even supply the end to all this Colony's problems.

281
00:23:23,189 --> 00:23:27,700
Yes, it will end the colony's problems, because it will end the colony!

282
00:23:28,164 --> 00:23:32,699
I am your servant.

283
00:23:34,673 --> 00:23:40,594
It... it spoke! Janley, did you hear it? It can actually talk!

284
00:23:40,932 --> 00:23:57,338
It can do many things, Lesterson. But the thing it does most efficiently is exterminate human beings. It destroys them, without mercy, without conscience. It destroys them. Utterly. Completely. It destroys them.

285
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:02,531
I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant.
