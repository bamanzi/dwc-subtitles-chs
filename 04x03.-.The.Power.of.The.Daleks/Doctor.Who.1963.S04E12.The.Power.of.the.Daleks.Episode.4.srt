Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:47,913
We will get our power. We will get our power. We will get our power. We will get our power. We will get our power. We will get our power.

3
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:55,224
Turn back the power supply.

4
00:00:55,496 --> 00:01:00,024
I will, I will. But I want you to remember that I control you.

5
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:05,478
We are your servants.

6
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:18,846
I know. Remember it. I gave you each a special charge to bring you back to life. Any further power you need must come from this generator. And I control it. Is that clear?

7
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:21,659
We obey.

8
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:38,159
Where are they going?

9
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,570
To await your orders, master.

10
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,255
Good. Have you completed the blueprints for the meteor storm computer?

11
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,036
It is ready.

12
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:09,135
Oh, it's marvellous! I'm glad we understand each other.

13
00:02:09,724 --> 00:02:15,029
We understand the human mind.

14
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:17,938
Isn't that finished yet?

15
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:19,201
Nearly.

16
00:02:25,222 --> 00:02:26,820
This is Valmar. Test call please.

17
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:37,123
Terrace. So I can hear you clearly all right, good. Now try and get in connection now with the interior, and then the perimeter stations.

18
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:42,030
Well, no troubles now.

19
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:45,560
About time. This work should have been completed long before this.

20
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:46,922
Well, I did the best I could!

21
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:48,221
Well, it isn't good enough!

22
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:50,204
Then get someone else, Bragen.

23
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:54,722
Be careful! I shall be watching you, Valmar, after this - now get out!

24
00:02:58,717 --> 00:03:00,091
What does this intrusion mean?

25
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,614
I'm sorry, Bragen. I tried to stop them.

26
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:11,897
Intrusion? It's no intrusion. We're just returning the various calls that you made. This guard tried to tell us you were busy. You're not a bit, are you?

27
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,344
All right - I'll see them.

28
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:20,331
Oh, what a nice new uniform. Very smart, very smart. I would like a hat like that.

29
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:21,821
Well, what do you want?

30
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:24,484
Some joker has kidnapped Polly and sent us this note.

31
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:25,436
Yes.

32
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:27,562
Well, we want to know what you're doing to find her.

33
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:30,645
Now that the communications are restored we can start a search.

34
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:34,554
Yeah, I can just imagine what kind of job you'll make of that. Haven't you heard anything yet?

35
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:36,210
The planet is a large one.

36
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:44,401
So! They've given you the run of the colony, have they?

37
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:54,560
We obey. Do I bring liquid for your visitors?

38
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:57,107
No. They won't be staying much longer.

39
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:09,960
Look, Doctor, if he's not going to help us, we'll have to search for Polly ourselves.

40
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:13,037
Sound advice. Why don't you, Doctor?

41
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,172
Ah, ah, Examiner.

42
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:22,653
I wonder how much longer they'll be able to move around on these floors?

43
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:23,417
Eh?

44
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:26,044
Floors. They're not metal.

45
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:28,387
Doctor.

46
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:49,842
Ah, there you are Bragen. Thank heavens the communications are working again. It's bad enough being stuck out here on the perimeter. Well? Your report man. Hurry up. I've got a very full schedule.

47
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,357
There is nothing to report, Governor.

48
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:53,447
The Examiner?

49
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:55,335
I'm taking good care of him.

50
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:56,820
Good, you know my orders.

51
00:04:57,045 --> 00:04:57,705
Yes, sir.

52
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,842
All right, well you can reach me here if you have to, that's all.

53
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:04,026
One moment, Governor. When will you be coming back?

54
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,955
Oh, not for a day or two at least. You can manage, can't you?

55
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:08,908
Yes. Yes of course, Governor.

56
00:05:12,777 --> 00:05:13,990
What do you want?

57
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:18,442
Have you finished your liquid?

58
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,375
No. No I haven't.

59
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:33,555
You'd better check the agenda.

60
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,787
I'll do it now.

61
00:05:38,907 --> 00:05:45,437
Static you see. They need a constant supply of static from the floor, some sort of electrical field.

62
00:05:48,337 --> 00:05:51,431
Doctor. Why should he...?

63
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:09,291
It's madness!

64
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:10,262
What is?

65
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:13,361
Letting them run around like this.

66
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:18,593
Hey, wait a minute! Bragen had one acting as a servant, and we've just left him!

67
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:24,233
One Dalek in Bragen's office - three Daleks just gone down the corridors. That makes four!

68
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:26,545
Where did the fourth one come from?

69
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:34,235
Well, Lesterson can't have been making them. Perhaps there were more in the capsule than we thought?

70
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:38,826
We must go and see Lesterson. Yeah, and show him this note. Maybe he or Janley knows where Polly is.

71
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:47,265
We frightened him off. I wonder what the fascination of this notice board is?

72
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:50,158
It looks like a perfectly ordinary noticeboard to me.

73
00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:56,430
Yeah, well come on, Doctor. We must find out who's got Polly. Doctor, come on!

74
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:06,898
Janley?

75
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,237
What is it?

76
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:11,413
The Daleks. They've given me another list of materials they need.

77
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:14,639
Let me see. We've got all those things?

78
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:23,217
Yes, but why these quantities, Janley? Why? How can they have used up all the materials I gave them? What is it? D... why, it's only a matter of a few hours ago.

79
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,880
They're building new things for us.

80
00:07:25,074 --> 00:07:30,426
Yes, well I don't want them to do anything without consulting me. What is it they do inside there?

81
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:32,035
You're worrying too much.

82
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:45,544
Look Janley, say what you like, but I'm beginning to believe that the Examiner is right about the Daleks. Their original thinking terrifies me. If we can control them, fine. But if not...

83
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:47,782
Yes?

84
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:58,334
Then I shall have them destroyed. It's too dangerous. The Examiner knows something about them that we don't. I'm going to ask his advice.

85
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:02,187
I wouldn't bring the Examiner into it if I were you.

86
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,944
And why not?

87
00:08:03,444 --> 00:08:05,760
You want him to find out about Resno?

88
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:08,880
Oh, a little accident. How is he? Is he better?

89
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,409
He's dead.

90
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:15,685
What are you talking about? You told me he was...

91
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,942
You're busy with the experiments on the Daleks.

92
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:24,329
But you should have told me. But... but the body - it'll have to be reported.

93
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:27,097
Don't worry, no one will find the body.

94
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:32,774
Oh Janley, you've done a terrible thing.

95
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,260
The experiments on the Daleks were more important.

96
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:38,548
More important than human life? No. No, I won't accept that.

97
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:48,382
You will. You must! Your carelessness was the cause of Resno's death. You murdered him. It's only your word against mine.

98
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:54,087
I won't be blackmailed by you!

99
00:08:54,498 --> 00:08:59,185
All I want is for you to go on as you are. Scientific discovery can't stop dead, Lesterson.

100
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:02,854
I told the guard that no-one was to be allowed in.

101
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,810
"Accord every access" remember?

102
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:06,245
We're looking for Polly.

103
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:08,450
Well, she isn't here, and I haven't seen her.

104
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,667
Well, she's been kidnapped.

105
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:11,303
Oh, it sounds a little unlikely.

106
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:13,641
Oh it does, does it? Well, we've got this note which tells us so.

107
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:16,508
I'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about it.

108
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:18,400
Lesterson?

109
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:19,167
Yes?

110
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:22,799
You haven't been building Daleks, have you?

111
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:25,994
Building? No I wouldn't know how to begin.

112
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,425
And there were only three in the capsule?

113
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:29,262
Yes.

114
00:09:30,864 --> 00:09:35,913
Well we've just seen four. One in the Governor's office and three in the corridor!

115
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:38,999
But that's not possible!

116
00:09:39,377 --> 00:09:43,434
There's only one explanation. The Daleks are reproducing themselves!

117
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:45,930
These things are machines. How could they reproduce?

118
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:54,777
Machines! What makes you think they're just machines. The Daleks are brilliant engineers. Nothing is beyond them given the right materials.

119
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,845
What?

120
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:00,297
I said nothing is beyond them given the right materials.

121
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:01,284
Oh...

122
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,710
Lesterson, what's the matter?

123
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:03,458
Oh...

124
00:10:04,802 --> 00:10:06,779
Leave him alone. He's just been overworking, that's all.

125
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,856
Well, he looks bad.

126
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:14,160
Will you both go away. Guard! It's you - badgering him with questions. You've done nothing but hound him ever since you arrived on Vulcan.

127
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:16,748
Bragen's orders were that no one was to be admitted.

128
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:18,288
Yes, but I thought that the... the Examiner.

129
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:20,922
He attacked Lesterson. Get them out of here. Both of them.

130
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,189
He did not attack Lesterson.

131
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:23,346
Out, do you hear?!

132
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:26,755
All right, all right.

133
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:37,446
Janley here. Tell Valmar to come over to the lab right away. Good.

134
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:50,044
Now, it's all right. Come on. Rest here for a bit. There. You've been doing far too much.

135
00:10:50,595 --> 00:10:52,295
Ssssh.

136
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,597
I've sedated him.

137
00:11:01,873 --> 00:11:03,579
Well, what's the matter with him?

138
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:12,180
Overwork, I suppose. He just suddenly broke up. Anyway, it'll give you a chance to lay in the new power cable the Daleks have asked for.

139
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:14,289
You don't miss a trick, do you?

140
00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:22,233
We're going to lay in the new cables you wanted.

141
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:28,711
Good.

142
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:30,733
You're sure this is okay, Janley?

143
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:33,248
Of course. We help them. They help us.

144
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:37,354
Yes. We are your servants.

145
00:11:37,592 --> 00:11:40,544
Don't take too long about it, Valmar. Oh, you saw the notice, did you?

146
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:41,525
I saw it.

147
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:46,353
Well, we're still no nearer finding Polly. What are we hanging about here for?

148
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:53,449
Ben, I've found a message in code. It's an anagram, you just take the capital letters, see, work it out yourself.

149
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,889
Oh, I can't do crosswords.

150
00:11:56,534 --> 00:12:06,832
Meeting tonight, 2000 hours. R O C K E T - Rocket. R O O M - Room. P. Rocket Room P!

151
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:20,135
It's the rebels way of calling a meeting. Only tonight we're going to be there - early.

152
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:23,439
Yeah, maybe we're nearer finding Polly than I thought.

153
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:34,963
Aw, I've got pins and needles now.

154
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:36,671
What's the time?

155
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,132
Time we went home!

156
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:38,934
Yes.

157
00:12:57,156 --> 00:13:10,660
Now, we're going to demonstrate something. You section leaders can pass on what you've seen. So far, we've been concerned with testing the strength of the Governor with a few acts of sabotage. But now, we're ready to take over.

158
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:17,119
What is that thing? I've seen them moving about, but all we've been told is that it's a machine Lesterson discovered.

159
00:13:17,374 --> 00:13:18,093
Valmar?

160
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:28,333
Well, Lesterson removed the armaments of the Daleks he discovered. I've rearmed this one, but with a controlling device. We can regulate the fire power and turn it off and on whenever we choose.

161
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:30,790
Shall we have the demonstration now?

162
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:36,024
That's the one we want. He must be the boss of this outfit.

163
00:13:37,064 --> 00:13:37,929
Sssh!

164
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:49,318
This screen is two inch thick tungsten steel. Right, Valmar.

165
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:53,407
Fire at the screen.

166
00:13:57,464 --> 00:14:00,318
Quiet! You must keep quiet. We're too vulnerable here.

167
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,413
But, you can't control a thing like that. It'll turn on us!

168
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:03,431
No it won't.

169
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:05,150
I wouldn't let any of my group go anywhere near it.

170
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:06,624
I can control it.

171
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:17,227
Prove it. Ah, you daren't! I'm not talking about that thing firing at the wall or bits of metal or anything. I mean people. Have you tested whether it... you can stop it from killing people? Our people?

172
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:19,031
Look, I can show you what I've done here.

173
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:23,163
Forget it. How do you know a Dalek can tell the difference between the Governor's people and our people?

174
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,334
But I can tell the difference, you fool! And I control it.

175
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,010
We want something better than words.

176
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,625
Test it on me. Will that satisfy you?

177
00:14:32,082 --> 00:14:33,083
Well yes, but...

178
00:14:33,353 --> 00:14:34,379
She's out of her mind!

179
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,219
Is it all right?

180
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:56,102
Now, when I tell you to fire...

181
00:14:56,346 --> 00:14:58,927
I am your servant.

182
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:06,523
Get back to your places.

183
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,739
Are you all right?

184
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:09,652
Of course. I don't take needless risks

185
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:10,803
Oh well done, Janley.

186
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:19,218
You haven't disarmed the Dalek! Well go on take the gun away. We don't want any accidents. Now, what about the girl?

187
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,120
We've got her safely locked up. Never fear.

188
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:22,606
I think the best thing for us to do is...

189
00:15:22,753 --> 00:15:24,181
Hear that? Maybe they'll say were she is.

190
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:26,086
Who's there?

191
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,256
You stay there, I'll distract them. Find out where Polly is.

192
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:29,047
No!

193
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:29,979
Help! Help!

194
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:35,753
The guards will have heard that! Come on we've got to get out of here! Take him and lock him up! Quick! Out!

195
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:42,019
You might as well come out. We know you're there.

196
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:53,831
Bragen!

197
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,877
Of course. Who else is fitted to be leader of the rebels?

198
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,160
No doubt you want to be leader of the Daleks too.

199
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:00,885
I am the leader of the Daleks.

200
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:03,324
Well see if you can stop this one from killing me.

201
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:12,909
Stop! You heard me, that's an order. Turn away. Fetch the guard.

202
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:19,054
I obey.

203
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:30,968
You hope to have it both ways, Bragen. But how will you look in front of the Governor, when I explain your dual role to him?

204
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:34,699
The Governor will hardly listen to an impostor.

205
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:38,118
An impostor? How do you propose to prove that?

206
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:42,339
My guards are now going to produce the body of the real Examiner from the mercury swamp.

207
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:43,726
The one you murdered.

208
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:45,039
The one you pretended to be.

209
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,920
Murder's a far worse crime than impersonation.

210
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:54,619
Yes, but you can't prove I'm a murderer, while I can prove that you're an impostor.

211
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:56,656
Take this man away. Detain him.

212
00:17:05,614 --> 00:17:06,940
A dangerous man.

213
00:17:07,673 --> 00:17:09,272
Now the only one left is the Governor.

214
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,301
Perhaps we should have dealt with the Examiner earlier.

215
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,796
I'll deal with him in time - and Quinn.

216
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:46,777
You're the last man I expected to see here.

217
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:49,273
Hmm. Work's by sound, does it?

218
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,960
I'm speaking to you, Examiner.

219
00:17:51,135 --> 00:17:51,752
Oh, I'm sorry.

220
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,906
If you'd listened to me in the first place, you wouldn't be locked up here now.

221
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:57,592
Well your imprisonment hasn't been entirely wasted. It's brought your enemy out into...

222
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,798
Bragen? I've known that all along.

223
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:02,975
Yes. But, ah, did you know that he was the leader of the rebels?

224
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:05,609
Bragen? The leader?

225
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:07,513
Yes. It's quite a simple sort of lock, really.

226
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,554
Hensell's trouble is he thinks he can run this colony on his personality alone.

227
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:17,716
But even if he knew of the danger, could he do anything? The rebels are well organised.

228
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:22,611
The Governor's popular. He can count on the mine workers of the perimeter for support.

229
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:24,421
In that case we must get word to him.

230
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:28,525
If you'd done your job properly, Examiner, you wouldn't be here now, and I'd have been out too.

231
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:48,020
Ah yes. But then, I'm not the real Examiner. Ben, Polly and I - We're... we're just travellers, that's all. I found the Examiner, dead. Bragen murdered him.

232
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:54,511
Everything leads back friend Bragen. Just give me a chance get my hands on him.

233
00:18:54,794 --> 00:18:56,983
We aren't going to have the chance, unless we can get out of here.

234
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:59,198
There's just a little matter of the cell doors.

235
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:12,390
Ah... Oh...

236
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,282
You sent for me?

237
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:31,569
Take up a position at the communications room. Watch and report.

238
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,589
I obey.

239
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:46,385
They're conspiring together! Oh, why didn't I realise? The Examiner was right. They are evil!

240
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:03,786
There are four. They can't be reproducing!

241
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:06,434
Dalek nine complete.

242
00:23:06,738 --> 00:23:07,114
Check.

243
00:23:07,618 --> 00:23:08,901
We are the new race of Daleks!

244
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,247
Dalek ten complete.

245
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:11,183
Check.

246
00:23:11,486 --> 00:23:13,291

247
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:14,046
Check.

248
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,731
Dalek twelve complete.

249
00:23:17,068 --> 00:23:17,476
Check.

250
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:20,511
Dalek thirteen complete.

251
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,246
Check.

252
00:23:21,543 --> 00:23:24,268
Dalek fourteen complete.

253
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:24,953
Check.

254
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:28,559
Dalek fifteen complete.

255
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:29,442
Check.

256
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:32,177

257
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:32,952
Check.

258
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,449
Dalek seventeen complete.

259
00:23:37,502 --> 00:23:37,706
Check.
