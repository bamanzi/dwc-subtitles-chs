1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:32,445
His face, his hair - look at it!

3
00:01:32,878 --> 00:01:33,913
He's breathing...

4
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:38,344
...and the TARDIS seems to be normal.

5
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:42,691
Ben, what are we going to do? We can't just leave the Doctor there.

6
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,560
What, him? The Doctor?

7
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:56,768
Ben, do you remember what he said in the tracking room? Something about "This old body of mine is wearing a bit thin. "

8
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,163
So he gets himself a new one?

9
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:00,581
But it's impossible!

10
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:03,916
Not so long ago we'd have been saying that about a lot of things.

11
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:07,186
It's over.

12
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,763
It's over.

13
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:58,097
What are we going to do?

14
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,952
It is the Doctor. I know it is... I think.

15
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:06,242
It's not only his face that's changed - he doesn't even act like him.

16
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,277
Come on, it's time we sorted this out.

17
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,306
Now look here!

18
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:14,359
Hold that.

19
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:15,995
And tilt it.

20
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,717
Have you done with this?

21
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:37,442
Put it down, put it down.

22
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:39,585
Now, what's the game?

23
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:40,479
Ah!

24
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:43,518
The crusades, from Saladin.

25
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:46,594
The Doctor was a great collector, wasn't he!

26
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:48,091
But you're the Doctor!

27
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,565
Oh, I don't look like him.

28
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:52,428
Who are we?

29
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:53,832
Don't you know?

30
00:03:58,442 --> 00:03:59,484
Extermination!

31
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:06,242
Now look, the Doctor always wore this. So if you're him, it should fit now, shouldn't it?

32
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:09,929
There - that settles it.

33
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:13,816
I'd like to see a butterfly fit into a chrysalis case after it's spread its wings.

34
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:15,311
Then you did change!

35
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:17,927
Life depends on change... and renewal.

36
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:23,997
The Doctor kept a diary, didn't he?

37
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:25,162
Yes.

38
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:28,379
I thought so. Now, I wonder where?

39
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:30,354
I wonder where?

40
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:32,868
He's a very different Doctor, Ben.

41
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:35,650
Yeah, maybe. Just where do we stand, though?

42
00:04:56,167 --> 00:05:02,434
Doctor? Doctor, what's going to happen to us?

43
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:11,046
I think... I think we must have landed for sometime. I think it's time we went for a stroll.

44
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:13,782
But you don't know where we've landed!

45
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,067
No, you haven't checked the oxygen or the temperature or anything!

46
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:31,253
Oxygen density one-seven-two, radiation nil, temperature... eighty-six - strong suggestion of mercury deposits. Satisfied, Ben? Now, are you two coming or are you not?

47
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:35,794
He does know us! He said "Ben", didn't you hear him?

48
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:37,463
Yeah, I heard.

49
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:51,082
Are you coming, you two?

50
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:52,136
Hello?

51
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:57,493
Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello?

52
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:02,250
Hello? Why don't they come?

53
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:08,774
Ah, so you've come at last. I'm from Earth. I'm the Examin...

54
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:43,441
"Earth Examiner. Accord every access. Vulcan. "

55
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:53,071
Whoa, they're hot!

56
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:55,298
Hmm, do you think the air's like this everywhere?

57
00:06:55,553 --> 00:07:06,402
Nah - might be just round here. Don't want too many lung full of it, I know that. Here, when I was a kid, we used to live opposite a brewery. You could take a walk and get tipsy all in one go!

58
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,065
It's beautiful!

59
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:09,539
No, don't touch it, Polly!

60
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:11,069
I wasn't going to.

61
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:13,440
No, it's quicksilver - it gets through the pores.

62
00:07:13,798 --> 00:07:18,643
Where is the Doctor, or whatever he is, got to?

63
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:38,985
So the murdered man was the real Examiner?

64
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:41,242
Well, didn't you see who did it?

65
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,177
The Doctor got this button though.

66
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,913
Well, I think it's pretty dull around here. I don't know why we don't just go back to the TARDIS.

67
00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:52,238
Doctor, are you going to let them think you're the real Examiner?

68
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:56,087
Well, won't that be dangerous?

69
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:59,959
Look, why don't you stop blowing that thing and talk to us properly?

70
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:00,648
Ben!

71
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:01,882
Now don't you start - it's bad enough with him!

72
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:02,879
Well, he hasn't done anything.

73
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:09,912
No, that's just the trouble! He knows what happened back at the TARDIS, yet will he tell us? Will he come out and say? Will he admit to being the Doctor?

74
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,327
Come in!

75
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:20,991
I am Hensell - the Governor.

76
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,984
If Earth had seen fit to warn us you were coming...

77
00:08:24,195 --> 00:08:29,371
If Earth didn't warn you we were coming, Governor, they must have had a very good reason. I wonder what it was?

78
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:35,254
Now look here - I run this Colony. I'm entitled to know why you've come to Vulcan. What is your brief?

79
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,502
I am the Examiner.

80
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:38,134
Why are you here?

81
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:43,049
To examine. And I intend to start my examination at once!

82
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:49,250
Someone's leaked reports about these rebel groups - that's it, isn't it?

83
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:52,007
There is Lesterson's capsule.

84
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:55,446
Internal affairs are my business, Bragen. Please don't interfere!

85
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,067
Please go on.

86
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:01,817
The capsule. It was found in a mercury swamp. It must have been here for centuries before...

87
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:06,539
...the Earth colony arrived. I felt it might be dangerous, it might contain bacteria.

88
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:09,606
I shall examine the capsule.

89
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:34,159
Where did you get this?

90
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:36,093
It dropped from the capsule.

91
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,450
Dropped?

92
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:49,660
Yes, when it was being hauled into the laboratory. But, you can see! This metal could revolutionise space travel. That's why I'm insisting that we open it. Well, who knows what other marvels there may be inside?

93
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:52,262
But Lesterson, I didn't think you could open it?

94
00:09:52,779 --> 00:10:00,931
Well, I have a theory. I'm convinced that the opening mechanism on the other side is either here, or here.

95
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:02,880
Extermination...

96
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:08,149
Now, my theory is that I can insert a laser ray in this ridge here.

97
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:13,508
The ray spreads, fuses the opening device and gets us in.

98
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:16,994
Examiner, I shall have to make it your responsibility.

99
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:20,202
A laser? Why not? It shouldn't be too difficult.

100
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,385
Well, we'll try the other side.

101
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,903
Hmm, it's a bit... disappointing.

102
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:53,492
Not really. This is just an entry bay, isn't it?

103
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,808
Yes, I... I suppose so.

104
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:57,660
Well, this doesn't get us very far does it?

105
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:00,851
Ah, getting into the rest of the capsule will take time, Governor.

106
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,208
Well, can't you use that torch thing again? That must be an opening door.

107
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,344
Well, I should have to measure it up and find out where the lock mechanism is.

108
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,112
And I think we'll leave if for tonight.

109
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:08,923
Leave it?

110
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:11,112
Leave it for tonight? But what did we come here for?

111
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:12,730
That is my decision, Governor.

112
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,113
But, good heavens above, man!

113
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:16,203
Two hundred years, you say, this has been buried?

114
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,666
Oh, at least. Now, there must be something in the inner compartment.

115
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,490
We shall be able to find out where it came from originally.

116
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:24,335
It didn't come from this planet - Vulcan.

117
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:27,151
Oh no, no, no. The metal is quite alien.

118
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:33,171
Alien, yes. Very alien. Goodnight.

119
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,780
What's he up to now?

120
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,864
Ben, we're not going to let him out of our sight.

121
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:50,045
Well, Lesterson, you got your way. Was it worth sending for this Examiner? This idiotic Examiner?

122
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:52,088
I didn't send for him. I thought you did.

123
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:55,690
Why don't you let me talk to the Examiner, Hensell? I can find out what's he's here for.

124
00:11:55,863 --> 00:12:02,120
No, no, no, no, you keep away from him. We'll leave him to work with Lesterson here. We've all got enough to do without having to worry about some amateur critic from Earth interfering.

125
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:02,833
But with five minutes, I _...

126
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:11,397
You heard what I said, Quinn. You won't mind keeping the Examiner busy, Lesterson? I don't mind what you do with him so long as you keep his nose... out of our business.

127
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:12,441
Yes. All right.

128
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:14,352
All right. Well, we shall talk about it tomorrow.

129
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:29,041
Ben!

130
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:30,359
What?

131
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:31,809
Shh! He's in the corridor.

132
00:12:31,998 --> 00:12:32,569
Who is?

133
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:34,194
The Doctor, you clod! Come on - quick!

134
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:41,863
He's going towards Lesterson's lab.

135
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,795
Of course - to the space capsule!

136
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:44,801
Come on.

137
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:50,411
Polly, Ben, come in and meet the Daleks.

138
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:51,501
What?

139
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,183
The Daleks.

140
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:13,236
You could have opened this before.

141
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:15,261
These two pieces of metal are identical.

142
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,167
I knew I should find them here.

143
00:14:18,722 --> 00:14:21,262
Ah, they look harmless, not very lively.

144
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:26,879
Two hundred years in a swamp and you wouldn't look very lively either. Nothing could live through that, could it?

145
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,892
Live?

146
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:29,651
Nothing human, no.

147
00:14:30,107 --> 00:14:31,519
Doctor, look!

148
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:34,174
What's the matter?

149
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:40,257
Well, there were three Daleks in here! What's happened to the other one?

150
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,095
Doctor, look!
