1
00:50:27,043 --> 00:50:33,224
Turn back the power supply.

2
00:50:33,496 --> 00:50:38,024
I will, I will. But I want you to remember that I control you.

3
00:50:38,522 --> 00:50:43,478
We are your servants.

4
00:50:43,871 --> 00:50:56,846
I know. Remember it. I gave you each a special charge to bring you back to life. Any further power you need must come from this generator. And I control it. Is that clear?

5
00:50:57,163 --> 00:50:59,659
We obey.

6
00:51:12,348 --> 00:51:13,659
Where are they going?

7
00:51:13,979 --> 00:51:19,070
To await your orders, master.

8
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:23,755
Good. Have you completed the blueprints for the meteor storm computer?

9
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,536
It is ready.

10
00:51:33,017 --> 00:51:44,135
Oh, it's marvellous! I'm glad we understand each other.

11
00:51:44,224 --> 00:51:49,529
We understand the human mind.

12
00:51:52,464 --> 00:51:53,638
Isn't that finished yet?

13
00:51:54,026 --> 00:51:54,901
Nearly.

14
00:51:55,022 --> 00:51:58,060
About time. This work should have been completed long before this.

15
00:51:58,303 --> 00:51:59,422
Well, I did the best I could!

16
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:00,721
Well, it isn't good enough!

17
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:02,704
Then get someone else, Bragen.

18
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:07,222
Be careful! I shall be watching you, Valmar, after this - now get out!

19
00:52:11,217 --> 00:52:12,591
What does this intrusion mean?

20
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,114
I'm sorry, Bragen. I tried to stop them.

21
00:52:15,372 --> 00:52:24,397
Intrusion? It's no intrusion. We're just returning the various calls that you made. This guard tried to tell us you were busy. You're not a bit, are you?

22
00:52:24,751 --> 00:52:25,844
All right - I'll see them.

23
00:52:26,205 --> 00:52:32,831
Oh, what a nice new uniform. Very smart, very smart. I would like a hat like that.

24
00:52:33,286 --> 00:52:34,321
Well, what do you want?

25
00:52:34,591 --> 00:52:36,984
Some joker has kidnapped Polly and sent us this note.

26
00:52:37,264 --> 00:52:37,936
Yes.

27
00:52:38,232 --> 00:52:40,062
Well, we want to know what you're doing to find her.

28
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:43,145
Now that the communications are restored we can start a search.

29
00:52:43,482 --> 00:52:47,054
Yeah, I can just imagine what kind of job you'll make of that. Haven't you heard anything yet?

30
00:52:47,268 --> 00:52:48,710
The planet is a large one.

31
00:52:53,364 --> 00:52:56,901
So! They've given you the run of the colony, have they?

32
00:52:57,383 --> 00:53:07,060
We obey. Do I bring liquid for your visitors?

33
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:09,607
No. They won't be staying much longer.

34
00:53:19,754 --> 00:53:22,460
Look, Doctor, if he's not going to help us, we'll have to search for Polly ourselves.

35
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:25,537
Sound advice. Why don't you, Doctor?

36
00:53:25,878 --> 00:53:28,672
Ah, ah, Examiner.

37
00:53:29,603 --> 00:53:33,353
I wonder how much longer they'll be able to move around on these floors?

38
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:34,117
Eh?

39
00:53:34,207 --> 00:53:40,737
Static you see. They need a constant supply of static from the floor, some sort of electrical field.

40
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,731
Doctor. Why should he...?

41
00:54:03,812 --> 00:54:04,591
It's madness!

42
00:54:04,956 --> 00:54:05,562
What is?

43
00:54:05,794 --> 00:54:08,661
Letting them run around like this.

44
00:54:09,669 --> 00:54:13,893
Hey, wait a minute! Bragen had one acting as a servant, and we've just left him!

45
00:54:14,575 --> 00:54:19,533
One Dalek in Bragen's office - three Daleks just gone down the corridors. That makes four!

46
00:54:20,426 --> 00:54:21,845
Where did the fourth one come from?

47
00:54:22,831 --> 00:54:29,535
Well, Lesterson can't have been making them. Perhaps there were more in the capsule than we thought?

48
00:54:30,486 --> 00:54:31,098
Janley?

49
00:54:31,825 --> 00:54:32,437
What is it?

50
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:35,613
The Daleks. They've given me another list of materials they need.

51
00:54:35,846 --> 00:54:38,839
Let me see. We've got all those things?

52
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:47,417
Yes, but why these quantities, Janley? Why? How can they have used up all the materials I gave them? What is it? D... why, it's only a matter of a few hours ago.

53
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:49,080
They're building new things for us.

54
00:54:49,274 --> 00:54:54,626
Yes, well I don't want them to do anything without consulting me. What is it they do inside there?

55
00:54:54,869 --> 00:54:56,235
You're worrying too much.

56
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:09,744
Look Janley, say what you like, but I'm beginning to believe that the Examiner is right about the Daleks. Their original thinking terrifies me. If we can control them, fine. But if not...

57
00:55:11,472 --> 00:55:11,982
Yes?

58
00:55:13,401 --> 00:55:22,534
Then I shall have them destroyed. It's too dangerous. The Examiner knows something about them that we don't. I'm going to ask his advice.

59
00:55:23,322 --> 00:55:26,387
I wouldn't bring the Examiner into it if I were you.

60
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,144
And why not?

61
00:55:27,644 --> 00:55:29,960
You want him to find out about Resno?

62
00:55:30,466 --> 00:55:32,880
Oh, a little accident. How is he? Is he better?

63
00:55:33,089 --> 00:55:33,809
He's dead.

64
00:55:36,221 --> 00:55:39,085
What are you talking about? You told me he was...

65
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:41,342
You're busy with the experiments on the Daleks.

66
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:47,729
But you should have told me. But... but the body - it'll have to be reported.

67
00:55:48,074 --> 00:55:50,497
Don't worry, no one will find the body.

68
00:55:51,946 --> 00:55:56,174
Oh Janley, you've done a terrible thing.

69
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,660
The experiments on the Daleks were more important.

70
00:55:59,044 --> 00:56:01,948
More important than human life? No. No, I won't accept that.

71
00:56:03,513 --> 00:56:13,282
You will. You must! Your carelessness was the cause of Resno's death. You murdered him. It's only your word against mine.

72
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:17,987
I won't be blackmailed by you!

73
00:56:18,398 --> 00:56:23,085
All I want is for you to go on as you are. Scientific discovery can't stop dead, Lesterson.

74
00:56:24,526 --> 00:56:26,754
I told the guard that no-one was to be allowed in.

75
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,710
"Accord every access" remember?

76
00:56:28,935 --> 00:56:30,145
We're looking for Polly.

77
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:32,350
Well, she isn't here, and I haven't seen her.

78
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:33,567
Well, she's been kidnapped.

79
00:56:33,806 --> 00:56:35,203
Oh, it sounds a little unlikely.

80
00:56:35,383 --> 00:56:37,541
Oh it does, does it? Well, we've got this note which tells us so.

81
00:56:37,678 --> 00:56:40,408
I'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about it.

82
00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:42,300
Lesterson?

83
00:56:42,584 --> 00:56:43,067
Yes?

84
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:46,699
You haven't been building Daleks, have you?

85
00:56:46,891 --> 00:56:49,894
Building? No I wouldn't know how to begin.

86
00:56:50,132 --> 00:56:52,325
And there were only three in the capsule?

87
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:53,162
Yes.

88
00:56:54,764 --> 00:56:59,813
Well we've just seen four. One in the Governor's office and three in the corridor!

89
00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:02,899
But that's not possible!

90
00:57:03,277 --> 00:57:07,334
There's only one explanation. The Daleks are reproducing themselves!

91
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,830
These things are machines. How could they reproduce?

92
00:57:10,124 --> 00:57:18,677
Machines! What makes you think they're just machines. The Daleks are brilliant engineers. Nothing is beyond them given the right materials.

93
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:20,745
What?

94
00:57:21,979 --> 00:57:24,197
I said nothing is beyond them given the right materials.

95
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:25,184
Oh...

96
00:57:25,419 --> 00:57:26,610
Lesterson, what's the matter?

97
00:57:26,928 --> 00:57:27,358
Oh...

98
00:57:28,702 --> 00:57:30,679
Leave him alone. He's just been overworking, that's all.

99
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,756
Well, he looks bad.

100
00:57:31,957 --> 00:57:38,060
Will you both go away. Guard! It's you - badgering him with questions. You've done nothing but hound him ever since you arrived on Vulcan.

101
00:57:38,731 --> 00:57:40,648
Bragen's orders were that no one was to be admitted.

102
00:57:40,976 --> 00:57:42,188
Yes, but I thought that the... the Examiner.

103
00:57:42,414 --> 00:57:44,822
He attacked Lesterson. Get them out of here. Both of them.

104
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,089
He did not attack Lesterson.

105
00:57:46,444 --> 00:57:47,246
Out, do you hear?!

106
00:57:49,593 --> 00:57:50,655
All right, all right.

107
00:57:56,874 --> 00:58:01,346
Janley here. Tell Valmar to come over to the lab right away. Good.

108
00:58:03,788 --> 00:58:06,453
Well, we're still no nearer finding Polly. What are we hanging about here for?

109
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:09,549
Ben, I've found a message in code.

110
00:58:09,827 --> 00:58:10,989
Oh, I can't do crosswords.

111
00:58:12,634 --> 00:58:22,932
Meeting tonight, 2000 hours. R O C K E T - Rocket. R O O M - Room. P. Rocket Room P!

112
00:58:30,445 --> 00:58:36,235
It's the rebels way of calling a meeting. Only tonight we're going to be there - early.

113
00:58:36,853 --> 00:58:39,539
Yeah, maybe we're nearer finding Polly than I thought.

114
00:58:59,256 --> 00:59:12,760
Now, we're going to demonstrate something. You section leaders can pass on what you've seen. So far, we've been concerned with testing the strength of the Governor with a few acts of sabotage. But now, we're ready to take over.

115
00:59:13,311 --> 00:59:18,719
What is that thing? I've seen them moving about, but all we've been told is that it's a machine Lesterson discovered.

116
00:59:18,974 --> 00:59:19,693
Valmar?

117
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:29,933
Well, Lesterson removed the armaments of the Daleks he discovered. I've rearmed this one, but with a controlling device. We can regulate the fire power and turn it off and on whenever we choose.

118
00:59:31,017 --> 00:59:32,390
Shall we have the demonstration now?

119
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:40,918
This screen is two inch thick tungsten steel. Right, Valmar.

120
00:59:42,742 --> 00:59:45,007
Fire at the screen.

121
00:59:49,064 --> 00:59:51,918
Quiet! You must keep quiet. We're too vulnerable here.

122
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:54,013
But, you can't control a thing like that. It'll turn on us!

123
00:59:54,182 --> 00:59:55,031
No it won't.

124
00:59:55,769 --> 00:59:56,818
Now, what about the girl?

125
00:59:58,016 --> 00:59:59,720
We've got her safely locked up. Never fear.

126
00:59:59,957 --> 01:00:01,206
I think the best thing for us to do is...

127
01:00:01,353 --> 01:00:02,781
Hear that? Maybe they'll say were she is.

128
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:04,686
Who's there?

129
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:06,856
You stay there, I'll distract them. Find out where Polly is.

130
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:07,647
No!

131
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:08,579
Help! Help!

132
01:00:08,895 --> 01:00:11,353
The guards will have heard that! Come on we've got to get out of here!

133
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:14,019
You might as well come out. We know you're there.

134
01:00:24,341 --> 01:00:25,331
Bragen!

135
01:00:25,587 --> 01:00:28,377
Of course. Who else is fitted to be leader of the rebels?

136
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:30,660
No doubt you want to be leader of the Daleks too.

137
01:00:30,866 --> 01:00:32,385
I am the leader of the Daleks.

138
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:34,824
Well see if you can stop this one from killing me.

139
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:44,409
Stop! You heard me, that's an order. Turn away. Fetch the guard.

140
01:00:47,036 --> 01:00:50,554
I obey.

141
01:00:56,297 --> 01:01:02,468
You hope to have it both ways, Bragen. But how will you look in front of the Governor, when I explain your dual role to him?

142
01:01:02,689 --> 01:01:04,699
The Governor will hardly listen to an impostor.

143
01:01:05,095 --> 01:01:08,118
An impostor? How do you propose to prove that?

144
01:01:08,629 --> 01:01:12,339
My guards are now going to produce the body of the real Examiner from the mercury swamp.

145
01:01:12,603 --> 01:01:13,726
The one you murdered.

146
01:01:13,901 --> 01:01:15,039
The one you pretended to be.

147
01:01:15,287 --> 01:01:18,920
Murder's a far worse crime than impersonation.

148
01:01:19,146 --> 01:01:24,619
Yes, but you can't prove I'm a murderer, while I can prove that you're an impostor.

149
01:01:32,033 --> 01:01:33,390
Ah... Oh...

150
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,282
You sent for me?

151
01:01:44,587 --> 01:01:52,569
Take up a position at the communications room. Watch and report.

152
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:54,589
I obey.

153
01:01:57,478 --> 01:02:07,385
They're conspiring together! Oh, why didn't I realise? The Examiner was right. They are evil!

154
01:02:19,165 --> 01:02:24,786
There are four. They can't be reproducing!

155
01:05:15,841 --> 01:05:17,634
Dalek nine complete.

156
01:05:17,938 --> 01:05:18,314
Check.

157
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,447
Dalek ten complete.

158
01:05:21,665 --> 01:05:22,383
Check.

159
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:24,491
Dalek eleven complete.

160
01:05:24,804 --> 01:05:25,246
Check.

161
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:27,931
Dalek twelve complete.

162
01:05:28,268 --> 01:05:28,676
Check.

163
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:31,711
Dalek thirteen complete.

164
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:32,446
Check.

165
01:05:32,743 --> 01:05:35,468
Dalek fourteen complete.

166
01:05:35,818 --> 01:05:46,101
We are the Daleks! We are the new race of Daleks!
