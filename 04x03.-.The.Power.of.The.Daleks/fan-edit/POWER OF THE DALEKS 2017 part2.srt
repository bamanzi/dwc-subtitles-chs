1
00:14:43,354 --> 00:14:44,339
Doctor, look!

2
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,612
A light. A torch outside.

3
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:54,833
Did you see it?

4
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:55,936
Quickly Ben, quickly!

5
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:57,054
What was it?

6
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:17,859
Can you answer me?

7
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:21,779
It was a sort of disembodied hand. A sort of claw. It was horrible!

8
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,253
No. No, there's nothing.

9
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:43,260
You were right - there were three Daleks.

10
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:46,363
Do you know what it was?

11
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,848
If there were three, who moved it?

12
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,219
Don't ask me. Lesterson?

13
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:01,584
But he hadn't opened the capsule.

14
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,805
Now he said he hadn't opened it. Lets get our facts straight.

15
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,705
Aha, excellent! Good thinking, good thinking.

16
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:11,701
What, does that mean you think he's been inside?

17
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:14,132
Perhaps he's been experimenting on the Daleks? Ah.

18
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,688
But... but they're things I... I mean they're dead. They must be!

19
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,449
This light is dead. Now the watch!

20
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:24,933
Do you mean these things just need power?

21
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:38,548
Now, Lesterson's fanatic. The Governor's jealous of his own position. What does that suggest to you? Dunno. Hadn't thought about it. That all is not well with this colony. Add to that one Dalek!

22
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:41,164
Oh, blimey, you don't half make mountains, don't you? One Dalek?

23
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:44,633
Yes! All that is needed to wipe out this entire colony.

24
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:54,678
Examiner?

25
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:01,511
Bragen, don't you ever knock before you enter a room?

26
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:06,362
I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I was expecting to find the Examiner here - not you Quinn.

27
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:07,629
Well, he's not here.

28
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:15,013
The Governor gave express instructions that you were not to contact the Examiner - I find you here. I'm sure you can offer some suitable explanation.

29
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:17,165
I can. But not to you.

30
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:20,379
The Examiner is missing. He must be found immediately.

31
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:23,822
Doctor, look, if they're that dangerous, what are you going to do about it?

32
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:36,390
Save my breath. Would Lesterson listen? Uh, uh. Lesterson listen. Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen. Exercises the tongue. Try it! Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

33
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:40,678
Look, they think you're the Examiner, order them to destroy the Daleks! Well, chuck your weight about.

34
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:44,572
Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

35
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:46,327
Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

36
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:47,867
What do you think you're doing in here?

37
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:49,470
Listen, listen...

38
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,904
Who gave you permission?

39
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,346
Read this! Aloud!

40
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:56,379
Accord every access.

41
00:17:56,732 --> 00:18:02,005
Exactly! It doesn't say 'except your laboratory' anywhere does it? Unless it's in micro-print.

42
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:03,775
I should have been asked first!

43
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,221
Where is the third Dalek?

44
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:07,776
I don't know what you're talking about!

45
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:15,454
You opened up the capsule without permission. You found the inner compartment containing three Daleks, you took one of them away and you hid it!

46
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:18,397
Hid it? What... what nonsense!

47
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:20,209
May I ask what all this is about?

48
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:25,613
We opened an inner compartment in the capsule, and Lesterson had already been in there.

49
00:18:25,865 --> 00:18:27,088
I don't deny that.

50
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,333
And he's nicked a Dalek!

51
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:29,371
Dalek?

52
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:33,749
It's the name the Examiner has given to two metal creations that I've discovered inside the capsule.

53
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:35,170
And they're dangerous. Evil.

54
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:37,820
Lumps of metal! Quite inactive.

55
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:40,722
That's what you think, mate. If you'd seen...

56
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:52,767
I consider it's my duty as a scientist to... to examine and investigate these objects. Now please, all of you, keep out of my laboratory. Keep your hands off my experiments!

57
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:58,345
Those 'lumps of metal' - Daleks - I want them broken up, or melted down. Up, or down, I don't care which, but destroyed!

58
00:18:58,518 --> 00:18:59,717
I refuse to allow it.

59
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:05,196
I'm an Earth Examiner - I demand it.

60
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:06,806
You're exceeding your authority.

61
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:10,605
Perhaps we should ask the Governor about that? I wish to see him immediately!

62
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,869
That might be difficult.

63
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,754
But not impossible. Ben, Polly.

64
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:21,403
Could he stop the experiments?

65
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:31,112
I don't know. It's none of your business. You go and get Janley and then come back here. We haven't... haven't got any time to waste. Now go on man, quickly, quickly!

66
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:59,041
I'd advise a little discretion in your investigations. It's not a very good time, just now.

67
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:00,663
With all these disturbances...

68
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:01,630
Disturbances?

69
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:12,935
Yes, minor acts of sabotage, rebel cliques, secret newspapers, nothing important you understand, but it keeps the Governor busy. I have no doubt he'll tell you about it himself when I arrange your meeting with him.

70
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:14,113
When will that be?

71
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:20,251
Ah, he's going on a tour of the perimeter of the colony. I'll... I'll find out if he can see you before he goes.

72
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,621
Thank you.

73
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:38,382
Ah, it's a...

74
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:53,382
He won't stop me experimenting. There must be some way to bring you back to life - and I'm going to find it.

75
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:55,605
Here, I bet old Charlie Bragen did it!

76
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:56,433
Charlie?

77
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:58,048
Well Fred wouldn't suit him would it?

78
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:02,029
If he did do it, do you think it was his own idea? I mean - he could have been under orders.

79
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:05,354
You mean from the Governor? Ah, I don't know. What do you think, Doctor?

80
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:15,601
Oh, yes. Yes of course. Let's... let's consider this button for a moment. It's the only clue we've got to the murderer of the Examiner. The real Examiner.

81
00:21:15,936 --> 00:21:18,401
Hmm. And who asked for him to come?

82
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:21,618
Hmm. Well, Lesterson's crackers about that capsule. He wouldn't want anyone nosing about.

83
00:21:21,874 --> 00:21:24,002
Bragen said the Governor's been having trouble.

84
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:29,344
Naw, rule him out. Governors are all the same, he wouldn't ask for help. If he sent the word it would look as if he couldn't do the job properly.

85
00:21:29,613 --> 00:21:30,354
Yes.

86
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,522
Oh, well, I vote we go back to the TARDIS, I've had enough of this dump.

87
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:38,209
Have you? What about the Daleks?

88
00:21:38,482 --> 00:21:39,572
Well, they're dead.

89
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,796
Well, what about that thing we saw in the capsule - that was alive all right.

90
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:44,880
Well, can't explain that.

91
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:49,695
I can. And that's why we have to stay!

92
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:58,374
Ugly-looking brutes aren't they? Hey, what's he want to muck about with them for? Leave well alone, that's what I say.

93
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:04,307
You're a fine one to be a research assistant. Leave well alone? There'll be no progress on this planet with people like you around.

94
00:22:04,517 --> 00:22:13,942
We're doing all right as we are. Or we were until your lot came along stirring things up. You won't get away with it, you know. The Governor knows all about you rebels. He'll smash the lot of you when he's ready.

95
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:15,098
Governor?

96
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:16,202
Yeah, the Governor!

97
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,071
He couldn't smash...

98
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:37,654
Will you be quiet! Where do you both think you are? This is a scientific laboratory. Kindly keep your politics out of it. Come on, Resno. Man, get on with it. We haven't got all day. We've got to get this working before the Examiner stops us. He's got some phobia about these.. these Daleks?

99
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:41,643
I know the misery they cause - the destruction.

100
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:46,912
Well? Where is the Governor? What did he say?

101
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:52,048
He sends his apologies Examiner. He can't see you tonight, but he hopes to see you first thing in the morning.

102
00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:55,574
Well, it might not wait that long, Char... ah, Bragen.

103
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:56,909
It will have to.

104
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:58,092
Excuse me.

105
00:22:57,992 --> 00:22:58,815
Where are you going?

106
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:00,181
To see the Governor, of course.

107
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:06,498
I'm afraid that's not possible. Once his door is closed, no-one, not even you, Examiner, is allowed into his room!

108
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:11,098
Very well.

109
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:14,163
Thank you. Until the morning then.

110
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:18,346
What happens now?

111
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:24,153
I shall radio Earth. I'll get Earth to back me.

112
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:26,727
Connecting now.

113
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:31,223
All connections responding.

114
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:33,441
Nothing at all?

115
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:34,407
No.

116
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:39,395
It's moving!

117
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:56,772
Now, note this, Janley. Number one attachment with sucker stick responding. Number two attachment not moving. Number three attachment with lens responding. Watch these meters, Resno.

118
00:23:57,025 --> 00:23:57,841
Still responding.

119
00:23:58,114 --> 00:24:03,800
Now, it's reasonable to assume that this the sucker stick acts like some kind of a hand.

120
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:14,197
It's all right - don't be alarmed. We've only introduced temporary power. We shall have to be able to open it up before we could find how it works permanently.

121
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:15,746
It's a bit frightening.

122
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:21,856
Yes. Now, I cannot think what this short stubby arm is for.

123
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:23,821
Could the lens attachment be an eye?

124
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:42,407
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now it's quite possible that this, ah, Dalek... Now there must be some kind of directing influence. There may even be a simplified brain. Positronic, I shouldn't wonder. If only we could open it up!

125
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:45,988
Now what?

126
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,544
Everything functioning here.

127
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:51,935
Yes. Well, perhaps the power is leaking away somewhere. We'll... we'll try again.

128
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,828
Look at the eye-stick!

129
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:19,037
It's watching us!

130
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:20,302
Don't be absurd.

131
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:21,443
It was. I saw it!

132
00:25:21,684 --> 00:25:29,721
You can't use the phrase 'watching us'. You'll have us believing that th... the thing has intelligence next. Now, get on with your work, man!

133
00:26:00,523 --> 00:26:01,209
I know you're there.

134
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,409
Examiner, thank goodness, it's you. I've been trying to talk to you ever since you got here.

135
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:10,108
What's happening here? You again.

136
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:11,350
What do you want?

137
00:26:11,556 --> 00:26:13,322
I found the operator unconscious.

138
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:18,623
So did I! I was just looking at him, when I heard someone move. It must have been you.

139
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:20,338
And those?

140
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:23,922
I picked them up. What is all this?

141
00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:25,635
The cables have been cut.

142
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:31,875
This is serious. It's not just our own communications. We're cut off from Earth as well.

143
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:33,609
The only people who'd want to do that are the rebels.

144
00:26:33,864 --> 00:26:36,596
Those muscle boys of yours had any brains, they'd stop things like this.

145
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:41,681
And you say you picked these up? I suggest that you were sabotaging the communications...

146
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:42,496
That's a lie!

147
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:46,133
...having first attacked one of the engineers. I'd detain the Governor on evidence like that.

148
00:26:46,414 --> 00:26:48,652
I hope you're not thinking of detaining me, Bragen.

149
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:52,490
I've no option. I could hardly let you run around loose after this, could I? 

150
00:26:53,024 --> 00:26:56,781
All right - you win this round, Bragen. We'll see what it looks like in front of the Governor.

151
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,897
All connections responding.

152
00:27:00,193 --> 00:27:00,760
Excellent.

153
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:01,739
It's working!

154
00:27:01,957 --> 00:27:07,947
Excellent. Film it, film it now, Resno. And, note the readings, Janley.

155
00:27:11,592 --> 00:27:13,260
It seems to be interested in you, Resno.

156
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:16,245
What's the matter with you man?

157
00:27:16,895 --> 00:27:21,255
I tell you it's intelligent. It's watching me, Lesterson. Weighing me up! I can sense it!

158
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:22,400
Don't be a fool.

159
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,574
I don't like it I tell you. I don't know what these things can do.

160
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:30,566
No, and we never shall know, shall we, unless we take film of every reaction. Now get on with your work, man!

161
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:41,153
Resno!

162
00:27:47,956 --> 00:27:48,864
It's all right. He isn't dead.

163
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:49,925
What happened?

164
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:51,516
Knocked out by the shock waves.

165
00:27:53,616 --> 00:27:56,378
We must get him to the hospital. I'll go and get help.

166
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:22,189
But we've got to defend Quinn.

167
00:28:22,582 --> 00:28:25,401
Yeah, I know. He's innocent until he's proved guilty. But he is guilty.

168
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:27,006
He's the Deputy Governor!

169
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:33,978
So what? I had a headmaster once who got nicked for not paying his bus fare! And then there's the motive, don't forget the motive.

170
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:35,346
Like what for instance?

171
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:39,165
Well, he's the Deputy Governor, right? Maybe he wants to be Governor.

172
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:40,817
Oh, that's ridiculous!

173
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:47,374
Well, the jacket button wasn't! And he was caught red-handed in the Communications Room with a pair of pliers, and don't tell me he was plucking his eye-brows either.

174
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:51,167
Look, there are some people you know are all right. You just know by looking at them.

175
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,541
Good morning. The enquiry is about to begin. I've been sent to escort you.

176
00:28:57,595 --> 00:29:14,051
I am sorry I couldn't see you earlier, Examiner. Please sit down. Well, Quinn, I don't like this anymore than you do. What have you been up to?

177
00:29:14,443 --> 00:29:16,036
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

178
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:20,220
Well, what about Bragen's report then? These are facts, Quinn. Now, what have you got to say about it?

179
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,417
Does the engineer say I hit him?

180
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:23,967
How could he if he was hit from behind?

181
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:25,333
Then its only circumstantial evidence.

182
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:31,289
The Examiner was also attacked in the mercury swamp. We have a button from your jacket, found in the Examiner's hand.

183
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:33,487
I can't explain that.

184
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,748
I'm sure you can't!

185
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,065
Examiner.

186
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:41,236
You mentioned to Bragen that these machines of Lesterson's... What do you call them?

187
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:43,298
I call them what they are - Daleks.

188
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:48,047
Ah, yes, yes, yes, Daleks. You say they could be a motive for destroying our communications.

189
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,109
I do.

190
00:29:49,473 --> 00:29:51,725
Lesterson, this is a special enquiry. Now please.

191
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:53,739
This won't wait. You won't be disappointed!

192
00:29:53,747 --> 00:29:54,780
You heard what I said Lesterson!

193
00:29:54,812 --> 00:29:59,532
Governor, I've just completed a... an experiment which could revolutionise the whole colony. Bear with me.

194
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,929
Lesterson, what have you done? What have you done?

195
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:05,584
I'll show you. Janley, now!

196
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:44,100
It recognised the Doctor. It recognised him.

197
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:46,342
What's the matter, Doctor? Are you all right?

198
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,882
The fools. The stupid fools.

199
00:30:50,294 --> 00:30:52,902
You're scared! What can it do?

200
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,531
Nothing yet.

201
00:30:54,904 --> 00:30:58,314
It knew who you were! It sounds crazy, but it did.

202
00:30:58,574 --> 00:30:59,415
Knew who I was.

203
00:31:00,745 --> 00:31:02,082
The Dalek knows who you are.

204
00:31:02,543 --> 00:31:08,887
(This creation is called, I understand, a Dalek. Now, look at it. I have merely given it electrical power. But it is capable of storing it.) Moreover, it responds to orders. Turn around.

205
00:31:15,023 --> 00:31:17,957
Move that chair.

206
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:38,380
Stop. You see? Well, just think what this could do for our... our mining program, our processing, packaging. Dozens of labour jobs, Governor. It may even supply the end to all this Colony's problems.

207
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:43,250
Yes, it will end the colony's problems, because it will end the colony!

208
00:31:43,714 --> 00:31:48,249
I am your servant.

209
00:31:49,423 --> 00:31:56,144
It... it spoke! Janley, did you hear it? It can actually talk!

210
00:31:56,482 --> 00:32:12,888
It can do many things, Lesterson. But the thing it does most efficiently is exterminate human beings. It destroys them, without mercy, without conscience. It destroys them. Utterly. Completely. It destroys them.

211
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:18,081
I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant.
