1
00:00:01,605 --> 00:00:02,605
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:41,445
His face, his hair - look at it!

3
00:01:41,878 --> 00:01:42,913
He's breathing...

4
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:47,344
...and the TARDIS seems to be normal.

5
00:01:49,123 --> 00:01:51,691
Ben, what are we going to do? We can't just leave the Doctor there.

6
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,560
What, him? The Doctor?

7
00:01:54,878 --> 00:02:05,768
Well, that's who came through the doors - there was no one else outside. Ben, do you remember what he said in the tracking room? Something about "This old body of mine is wearing a bit thin. "

8
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,563
So he gets himself a new one?

9
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:10,920
Well, yes.

10
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:12,701
Oh, do me a favour!

11
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:18,705
Ben, whatever happened, happened in here.

12
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:20,581
But it's impossible!

13
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:24,316
Not so long ago we'd have been saying that about a lot of things.

14
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:29,421
Oh, Ben!

15
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:47,273
Slower... Slower!

16
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,768
Concentrate on one thing... one thing!

17
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,586
It's over.

18
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,163
It's over.

19
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:58,855
Doctor?

20
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:30,079
The muscles are still a bit tight.

21
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:36,497
What are we going to do?

22
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,352
It is the Doctor. I know it is... I think.

23
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:44,642
It's not only his face that's changed - he doesn't even act like him.

24
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,677
Come on, it's time we sorted this out.

25
00:04:57,771 --> 00:04:58,706
Now look here!

26
00:04:59,002 --> 00:04:59,759
Hold that.

27
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:01,395
And tilt it.

28
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,117
Have you done with this?

29
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:22,842
Put it down, put it down.

30
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:24,985
Now, what's the game?

31
00:05:25,422 --> 00:05:25,879
Ah!

32
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:28,918
The crusades, from Saladin.

33
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:31,994
The Doctor was a great collector, wasn't he!

34
00:05:32,214 --> 00:05:33,491
But you're the Doctor!

35
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,965
Oh, I don't look like him.

36
00:05:36,696 --> 00:05:37,828
Who are we?

37
00:05:38,227 --> 00:05:39,232
Don't you know?

38
00:05:47,842 --> 00:05:48,884
Extermination!

39
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:00,512
Ah!

40
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:09,624
Ah, very good. Nails need growing.

41
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:13,842
Now look, the Doctor always wore this. So if you're him, it should fit now, shouldn't it?

42
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:17,529
There - that settles it.

43
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:21,416
I'd like to see a butterfly fit into a chrysalis case after it's spread its wings.

44
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:22,911
Then you did change!

45
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:25,527
Life depends on change... and renewal.

46
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:30,736
Oh, so that's it - you've been renewed, have ya?

47
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:36,187
I've been renewed, have I? That's it, I've been renewed!

48
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:41,448
It's part of the TARDIS - without it, I couldn't survive.

49
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:42,729
Come here!

50
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:48,953
Come here.

51
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:55,397
The Doctor kept a diary, didn't he?

52
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:56,562
Yes.

53
00:06:57,476 --> 00:06:59,779
I thought so. Now, I wonder where?

54
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:01,754
I wonder where?

55
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:10,668
He's a very different Doctor, Ben.

56
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,450
Yeah, maybe. Just where do we stand, though?

57
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:46,834
Doctor? Doctor, what's going to happen to us?

58
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:55,446
I think... I think we must have landed for sometime. I think it's time we went for a stroll.

59
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:05,182
But you don't know where we've landed!

60
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,467
No, you haven't checked the oxygen or the temperature or anything!

61
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:22,653
Oxygen density one-seven-two, radiation nil, temperature... eighty-six
- strong suggestion of mercury deposits. Satisfied, Ben?
Now, are you two coming or are you not?

62
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:27,194
He does know us! He said "Ben", didn't you hear him?

63
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:31,863
Yeah, I heard. But he might just have been copying you though, mightn't he?

64
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:17,793
Oh no!

65
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:22,482
Are you coming, you two?

66
00:09:58,023 --> 00:10:00,422
Time I put you through some tests, I think!

67
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:04,436
Hello?

68
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:09,793
Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello?

69
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:14,550
Hello? Why don't they come?

70
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:21,074
Ah, so you've come at last. I'm from Earth. I'm the Examin...

71
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:23,741
"Earth Examiner. Accord every access. Vulcan. "

72
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:32,606
Doctor?! Where are you?

73
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,371
Whoa, they're hot!

74
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:44,598
Hmm, do you think the air's like this everywhere?

75
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:55,202
Nah - might be just round here.
Don't want too many lung full of it, I know that.
Here, when I was a kid, we used to live opposite a brewery.
You could take a walk and get tipsy all in one go!

76
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:57,365
It's beautiful!

77
00:11:57,648 --> 00:11:58,839
No, don't touch it, Polly!

78
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:00,369
I wasn't going to.

79
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,740
No, it's quicksilver - it gets through the pores.

80
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:07,943
Where is the Doctor, or whatever he is, got to?

81
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:13,278
What's the matter? Hey, Polly!

82
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:17,092
Hey, Doctor - wherever you are! Quick, there's something happened to Polly!

83
00:12:18,552 --> 00:12:20,223
Quick, over this way!

84
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,182
Doctor!

85
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:47,404
Ah, Quinn, there you are. What have you got there?

86
00:12:48,954 --> 00:12:51,392
My people have found two more of them by one of the pools.

87
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:57,789
This one's got a nasty bruise on the back of his head. Fallen over his feet and knocked himself out, I suppose.

88
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,294
I suppose so.

89
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:02,109
Why don't they use the kit we send them?

90
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:07,024
Yes, the other two have had a rather bad dose of fumes - the girl has anyway.

91
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:08,431
Girl?

92
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:10,036
Yes, but she'll recover.

93
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:14,707
These comic-opera guards of yours do have some uses after all.

94
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:16,530
I pick them for their physical fitness.

95
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:21,185
I thought it wasn't for their I.Q. Give me a hand with the Examiner, will you.

96
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:25,927
I wonder why Earth has chosen to send an Examiner to Vulcan? Just now, I mean?

97
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:27,052
I don't know.

98
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:30,170
A mystery, isn't it? He isn't due for another two years.

99
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:32,668
How do you feel?

100
00:13:33,154 --> 00:13:33,685
Oh...

101
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,960
We saw your rocket overshoot the landing area.

102
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:36,814
Eh?

103
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:41,895
Don't worry - most of the ships from Earth do over-shoot. I'm Quinn, Deputy Governor.

104
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:43,001
Bragen, Head of Security.

105
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,741
Let's get all back shall we? I'll take the girl.

106
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,772
Here, you two, help carry the Examiner.

107
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:56,037
I suppose you Earth people can't wait to examine Lesterson's space capsule?

108
00:13:57,746 --> 00:13:58,481
Eh?

109
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:19,349
Lesterson?

110
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:20,408
Look at this.

111
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,748
They've just brought in an Examiner from Earth, and a couple of assistants.

112
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,371
An Examiner? What's he here for?

113
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,614
I thought you'd know.

114
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:29,193
Ah, it's the capsule, it must be.

115
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:32,466
Well, they can't stop me working on it, I can tell you that.

116
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:33,915
Could anyone?

117
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:39,898
The Governor's always been difficult about it. But surely they wouldn't send someone all the way from Earth just to...?

118
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:41,494
Look, what about the meeting?

119
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,346
Meeting?

120
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:45,755
Yes - I've arranged everything. Can we still use the old rocket room?

121
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:50,450
Yes, I suppose so. But I do wish you wouldn't get mixed up with these pressure groups, Janley.

122
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:54,033
Well, somebody has to do something. The colony's running down and you know it.

123
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:55,291
Well, I am too busy.

124
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:59,917
But if we ran things, you'd have better facilities, more money. I wish you'd take an interest.

125
00:15:00,643 --> 00:15:06,497
Now look, I don't mind letting you have the use of one of my rooms now and again, Janley, but don't try to involve me.

126
00:15:08,546 --> 00:15:13,022
This is what I find important. Two hundred years in a mercury swamp...

127
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:17,009
...and this piece of metal that dropped from it. Look - a couple of minutes polishing and it's as good as new.

128
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:18,895
Wonderful.

129
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:27,390
Rain, damp, heat, mercury - nothing touches this metal. No corrosion, Janley - think of that.

130
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:31,812
Well, I hope the Examiner lets you go on with your experiments.

131
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:34,268
Frankly, I doubt it.

132
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:41,368
I think the Governor's brought the Examiner here to stop you opening the capsule.

133
00:15:43,153 --> 00:15:47,413
You should join our group, Lesterson. You might need us one day.

134
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:01,985
So the murdered man was the real Examiner?

135
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:04,242
Well, didn't you see who did it?

136
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:07,177
The Doctor got this button though.

137
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,913
Well, I think it's pretty dull around here. I don't know why we don't just go back to the TARDIS.

138
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:15,238
Doctor, are you going to let them think you're the real Examiner?

139
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:19,087
Well, won't that be dangerous?

140
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:22,959
Look, why don't you stop blowing that thing and talk to us properly?

141
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:23,648
Ben!

142
00:16:23,842 --> 00:16:24,882
Now don't you start - it's bad enough with him!

143
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:25,879
Well, he hasn't done anything.

144
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:32,512
No, that's just the trouble! He knows what happened back at the TARDIS, yet will he tell us? Will he come out and say? Will he admit to being the Doctor?

145
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,727
Come in!

146
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:45,391
I am Hensell - the Governor. I trust you're all feeling much better?

147
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,870
Huh, I've felt worse, Governor.

148
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:49,322
The Governor?

149
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:55,784
If Earth had seen fit to warn us you were coming, we might, possibly, have been able to guide you down to the landing area.

150
00:16:57,195 --> 00:17:02,371
If Earth didn't warn you we were coming, Governor, they must have had a very good reason. I wonder what it was?

151
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:08,754
Now look here - I run this Colony. I'm entitled to know why you've come to Vulcan. What is your brief?

152
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,002
I am the Examiner.

153
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:11,634
Why are you here?

154
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:16,549
To examine. And I intend to start my examination at once!

155
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:26,650
Someone's leaked reports about these rebel groups - that's it, isn't it?

156
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:29,420
Your turn now, Governor.

157
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:32,007
There is Lesterson's capsule.

158
00:17:32,206 --> 00:17:35,446
Internal affairs are my business, Bragen. Please don't interfere!

159
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,067
Please go on.

160
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:42,937
The capsule. It was found in a mercury swamp. It must have been here for centuries.

161
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,924
Interesting - continue.

162
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:51,739
For centuries before the Earth colony arrived. I felt it might be dangerous, it might contain bacteria.

163
00:17:54,802 --> 00:18:00,116
I shall examine the capsule... later. You may leave us.

164
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:12,288
I shall look forward to your report. Bragen, see that the Examiner and his party... get some proper clothes, will you?

165
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,157
We are wearing proper clothes!

166
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:35,579
Oh, how did he get that thing back again? That was a bit of a cheek, wasn't it? Er, seeing if the Governor was the guy that you got the button off?

167
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:36,516
Doctor?

168
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,131
Mmm?

169
00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:39,425
When he was talking to you, you were staring at the other man?

170
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,857
Yes, very rude of me, wasn't it? Terrible manners.

171
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:50,107
To tell you the truth, I was studying his reactions - seeing if he agreed with the story.

172
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,131
Did he?

173
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,765
Must have a look at that capsule.

174
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,678
You know, you wanna watch you don't take this Examiner stuff a bit too far.

175
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:58,409
Our answers must come from that mercury swamp.

176
00:18:58,582 --> 00:19:00,330
'Cos at least one bloke ain't gonna be fooled.

177
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,083
When Bragen found us, he definitely said space capsule.

178
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:08,306
Look, you're not going to fool the guy that did the real Examiner in!

179
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,584
Bragen! What's all this nonsense about having to have a pass to see the Examiner?

180
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,893
It's the Governor's idea.

181
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:23,041
Surely it doesn't apply to me?

182
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:27,144
It's not my order, Quinn. I expect the Governor wants to keep people away from him.

183
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:28,877
It sounded like one of your red-tape ideas.

184
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,405
It has nothing to do with me.

185
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:32,237
Right!

186
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:37,703
Oh!

187
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,007
Sorry, Janley.

188
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:39,740
My fault.

189
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:40,871
Are you all right?

190
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,121
Yes. Lesterson's just cleared me out of his lab.

191
00:19:45,857 --> 00:19:48,019
Is the Examiner going to let him open the capsule?

192
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:52,885
I don't know. I'm on my way there now... if I can push past Bragen's army of layabouts.

193
00:20:20,661 --> 00:20:21,559
Where did you get this?

194
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,493
It dropped from the capsule.

195
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:24,220
Dropped?

196
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:37,560
Yes, when it was being hauled into the laboratory. But, you can see!
This metal could revolutionise space travel.
That's why I'm insisting that we open it.
Well, who knows what other marvels there may be inside?

197
00:20:37,815 --> 00:20:40,162
But Lesterson, I didn't think you could open it?

198
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:48,831
Well, I have a theory. I'm convinced that the opening mechanism on the other side is either here, or here.

199
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,780
Extermination...

200
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:56,049
Now, my theory is that I can insert a laser ray in this ridge here.

201
00:20:56,768 --> 00:21:01,408
The ray spreads, fuses the opening device and gets us in.

202
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,894
Examiner, I shall have to make it your responsibility.

203
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,102
A laser? Why not? It shouldn't be too difficult.

204
00:21:15,652 --> 00:21:18,285
Well, we'll try the other side.

205
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:47,803
Hmm, it's a bit... disappointing.

206
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:50,392
Not really. This is just an entry bay, isn't it?

207
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,708
Yes, I... I suppose so.

208
00:21:53,074 --> 00:21:54,560
Well, this doesn't get us very far does it?

209
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:57,751
Ah, getting into the rest of the capsule will take time, Governor.

210
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:00,108
Well, can't you use that torch thing again? That must be an opening door.

211
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:03,244
Well, I should have to measure it up and find out where the lock mechanism is.

212
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,012
And I think we'll leave if for tonight.

213
00:22:05,264 --> 00:22:05,823
Leave it?

214
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:08,012
Leave it for tonight? But what did we come here for?

215
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:09,630
That is my decision, Governor.

216
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:11,013
But, good heavens above, man!

217
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:13,103
Two hundred years, you say, this has been buried?

218
00:22:13,343 --> 00:22:16,566
Oh, at least. Now, there must be something in the inner compartment.

219
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:19,390
We shall be able to find out where it came from originally.

220
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,235
It didn't come from this planet - Vulcan.

221
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,051
Oh no, no, no. The metal is quite alien.

222
00:22:24,338 --> 00:22:30,071
Alien, yes. Very alien. Goodnight.

223
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,680
What's he up to now?

224
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,764
Ben, we're not going to let him out of our sight.

225
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:47,545
Well, Lesterson, you got your way. Was it worth sending for this Examiner? This idiotic Examiner?

226
00:22:47,855 --> 00:22:49,588
I didn't send for him. I thought you did.

227
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:53,190
Why don't you let me talk to the Examiner, Hensell? I can find out what's he's here for.

228
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:59,820
No, no, no, no, you keep away from him. We'll leave him to work with Lesterson here. We've all got enough to do without having to worry about some amateur critic from Earth interfering.

229
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:01,433
But with five minutes, I _...

230
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:10,497
You heard what I said, Quinn. You won't mind keeping the Examiner busy, Lesterson? I don't mind what you do with him so long as you keep his nose... out of our business.

231
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:11,541
Yes. All right.

232
00:23:11,846 --> 00:23:13,452
All right. Well, we shall talk about it tomorrow.

233
00:23:27,555 --> 00:23:28,141
Ben!

234
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:29,459
What?

235
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:30,909
Shh! He's in the corridor.

236
00:23:31,098 --> 00:23:31,669
Who is?

237
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:33,294
The Doctor, you clod! Come on - quick!

238
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:40,963
He's going towards Lesterson's lab.

239
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:42,895
Of course - to the space capsule!

240
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:43,901
Come on.

241
00:25:00,387 --> 00:25:05,811
Polly, Ben, come in and meet the Daleks.

242
00:25:06,116 --> 00:25:06,901
What?

243
00:25:07,187 --> 00:25:08,583
The Daleks.

244
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:28,636
You could have opened this before.

245
00:25:28,936 --> 00:25:33,661
These two pieces of metal are identical. The Doctor got one of them from the Daleks himself.

246
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:36,016
Why do you keep saying the Doctor if you mean you?

247
00:25:38,387 --> 00:25:41,867
I knew I should find them here - I knew it.

248
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:45,962
Ah, they look harmless, not very lively.

249
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:51,579
What do you think? Two hundred years in a swamp and you wouldn't look very lively either. Nothing could live through that, could it?

250
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,592
Live?

251
00:25:52,822 --> 00:25:54,351
Nothing human, no.

252
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:57,519
Doctor, look!

253
00:25:58,417 --> 00:25:59,874
What's the matter?

254
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:08,957
Well, there were three Daleks in here! What's happened to the other one?

255
00:26:12,816 --> 00:26:13,795
Doctor!
