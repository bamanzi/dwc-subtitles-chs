1
01:16:00,995 --> 01:16:01,724
Move on!

2
01:16:02,011 --> 01:16:02,658
The Dalek!

3
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:03,632
What about it?

4
01:16:03,815 --> 01:16:04,748
Can't you see it's armed?

5
01:16:04,976 --> 01:16:06,042
Keep moving!

6
01:16:08,316 --> 01:16:10,464
This area is restricted.

7
01:16:10,678 --> 01:16:11,722
On whose authority?

8
01:16:11,912 --> 01:16:12,772
Silence!

9
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:16,272
Repeat. This area is restricted.

10
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:22,623
Obey or you shall be exterminated.

11
01:16:22,883 --> 01:16:24,122
I thought they obeyed us?

12
01:16:24,303 --> 01:16:25,702
What do we do now, Doctor?

13
01:16:27,135 --> 01:16:28,269
This way.

14
01:16:32,315 --> 01:16:36,229
They will be exterminated.

15
01:16:36,444 --> 01:16:40,393
We've won. The revolution's over. I'll pass the word to Valmar, Kebble and the rest.

16
01:16:40,585 --> 01:16:44,032
Wait. The revolution is not quite over yet.

17
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:49,879
What more can we do? Hensell's dead, you're the new Governor. The battle's over.

18
01:16:50,086 --> 01:16:56,618
Not quite. You mentioned Kebble, Valmar and that rabble. Well now they must be dealt with.

19
01:16:57,026 --> 01:16:58,451
But those are our own men.

20
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:00,644
Huh, huh. Of course.

21
01:17:00,877 --> 01:17:02,070
I don't understand.

22
01:17:02,665 --> 01:17:19,706
Do you think I can ever be secure in that chair while that rabble are still loose? They rebelled against Hensell yesterday. Tomorrow it'll be my turn. Well, let them rebel. Tell them the guards have taken control. Let them attack, and then we can crush them, utterly!

23
01:17:21,131 --> 01:17:23,488
You say "we".

24
01:17:23,707 --> 01:17:28,274
Yes. We've come a long way together you and I. You going to back down now?

25
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,528
Couldn't you just arrest them?

26
01:17:31,757 --> 01:17:34,127
Everyone must be killed.

27
01:17:46,545 --> 01:17:47,827
Now!

28
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:50,534
What have you brought me in here for?

29
01:17:50,769 --> 01:17:51,508
Quiet!

30
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:55,413
Whose side are you on anyway?

31
01:17:55,635 --> 01:17:57,922
I thought I was going to be on the winning side.

32
01:17:58,128 --> 01:17:59,025
What changed your mind?

33
01:17:59,195 --> 01:18:03,982
Bragen. The colony's become too small for him. He wants us out of the way now.

34
01:18:04,176 --> 01:18:06,945
Yeah, well it often happens that way, mate, when you follow blokes like him.

35
01:18:07,166 --> 01:18:11,292
Look, I'm going to try and get your friends here, if I can. So wait here.

36
01:18:18,206 --> 01:18:36,529
People of Vulcan. This is your new Governor talking to you. I have to announce that Governor Hensell has been murdered by the rebels. I have taken control temporarily, until order is restored. People living on the perimeter and in the interior can stay calm. We know who the murderers are.

37
01:18:36,867 --> 01:18:43,581
I shall keep you informed of events as soon as I am able, so listen for the signal to watch your communication sets. That is all.

38
01:18:45,426 --> 01:18:46,764
Ah! There you are.

39
01:18:46,829 --> 01:18:47,612
- Ben!
- I knew you'd be all right!

40
01:18:47,785 --> 01:18:48,583
Polly - you okay?

41
01:18:48,769 --> 01:18:49,328
Oh, yes.

42
01:18:49,536 --> 01:18:50,490
Did Valmar find you, then?

43
01:18:50,644 --> 01:18:51,291
Valmar? No.

44
01:18:51,456 --> 01:18:52,921
What's this about Valmar?

45
01:18:53,138 --> 01:18:56,309
Well it seems Bragen's gone power-mad. He wants the rebels to revolt, then he can finish them off.

46
01:18:56,534 --> 01:19:00,364
The Daleks won't care who they fight. They'll exterminate every human being on this planet.

47
01:19:00,627 --> 01:19:03,348
Doctor, please let's go back to the TARDIS.

48
01:19:03,559 --> 01:19:05,169
Quinn. Keep them both here.

49
01:19:05,385 --> 01:19:06,588
Well, wait a minute, Doctor!

50
01:19:07,558 --> 01:19:08,781
All right. All right.

51
01:19:09,653 --> 01:19:14,398
Orders received. Daleks commence extermination.

52
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:19,720
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!

53
01:19:20,732 --> 01:19:22,073
Down everyone!

54
01:19:37,275 --> 01:19:38,458
Don't come any nearer.

55
01:19:38,545 --> 01:19:39,227
What do you mean?

56
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:45,980
I overheard your conversation with Bragen. But you can't stand up to the Daleks, so your plan will come to nothing.

57
01:19:46,413 --> 01:19:47,665
Not my plan - Bragen's.

58
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:48,680
But that's the same thing.

59
01:19:48,854 --> 01:19:49,483
Not any more.

60
01:19:49,665 --> 01:19:51,676
You expect me to believe that?

61
01:19:52,161 --> 01:19:59,518
I came here to do exactly what you've done. Let Bragen see what the Daleks are like. He doesn't know how strong they are.

62
01:19:59,771 --> 01:20:00,795
He's got to be stopped.

63
01:20:00,808 --> 01:20:05,967
You will lead us to the middle of your party of human beings.

64
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:06,762
Yes.

65
01:20:06,931 --> 01:20:09,584
We will fight for you.

66
01:20:11,192 --> 01:20:13,756
Believe me, Val, it's the only way to save all our lives.

67
01:20:13,955 --> 01:20:16,469
Did you know that the Daleks are duplicating?

68
01:20:16,674 --> 01:20:17,408
Yes.

69
01:20:17,573 --> 01:20:20,113
But we are your friends.

70
01:20:20,368 --> 01:20:22,531
We will serve you.

71
01:20:22,747 --> 01:20:25,982
Take us to the centre of your group.

72
01:20:26,298 --> 01:20:27,442
Can we trust them?

73
01:20:27,618 --> 01:20:33,778
We must! The guards have orders to wipe us out. We must use the Daleks. Come on.

74
01:20:44,808 --> 01:20:45,347
Doctor!

75
01:20:45,624 --> 01:20:46,510
The window. Does it open?

76
01:20:46,677 --> 01:20:47,226
I dunno.

77
01:20:47,404 --> 01:20:49,679
It had better, or we're done for! Out you go.

78
01:20:50,548 --> 01:20:52,689
Ah!... Ah!... What's happening?

79
01:20:52,925 --> 01:20:56,995
The Daleks. They're teeming all over the corridors. We've got to get back to Lesterson's lab.

80
01:21:11,304 --> 01:21:24,005
This is Governor Bragen speaking. A group of rebels is attempting to take over the colony. It is the duty of all loyal citizens to help the guards resist. Stay in your homes. Order will be restored. Listen to my bulletins.

81
01:21:24,937 --> 01:21:27,267
The rebels are using the Daleks against our people!

82
01:21:27,478 --> 01:21:31,604
Well, get back and fight! Why do you come running to me? What do you think your guns are for?

83
01:21:31,759 --> 01:21:32,862
Well, the guns don't work against them!

84
01:21:33,004 --> 01:21:33,968
Get back and fight them!

85
01:21:40,892 --> 01:21:42,062
There, and there!

86
01:21:47,046 --> 01:21:47,940
Over there!

87
01:21:48,577 --> 01:21:50,858
No! No! Over there! They're our people!

88
01:21:51,067 --> 01:21:51,764
Cut the Dalek gun off!

89
01:21:51,956 --> 01:21:55,911
No! Ah!...

90
01:21:56,705 --> 01:21:57,851
I told you to cut the gun off!

91
01:21:58,036 --> 01:21:58,572
I did!

92
01:21:59,108 --> 01:22:00,182
You've killed our own people!

93
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:02,583
We have to dismantle the gun, that's all.

94
01:22:03,963 --> 01:22:05,280
Oh, look at it.

95
01:22:07,331 --> 01:22:10,349
Your usefulness is over.

96
01:22:17,239 --> 01:22:18,010
Come on!

97
01:22:21,038 --> 01:22:22,870
Quick, Val. Come on!

98
01:22:25,704 --> 01:22:27,605
Doctor, it's stupid to hide in here!

99
01:22:27,796 --> 01:22:29,798
Well, do you fancy your chances outside in the corridor? No thanks.

100
01:22:30,018 --> 01:22:31,138
The answer must be here somewhere.

101
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:32,527
Ssssh!

102
01:22:32,891 --> 01:22:33,466
Ah!...

103
01:22:42,999 --> 01:22:50,769
You must be absolutely quiet. They know everything that's going on. Everything! They even know what you're thinking.

104
01:22:51,044 --> 01:22:52,949
Where do they get their power from, Lesterson?

105
01:22:53,152 --> 01:23:01,343
Ah, I tried to turn the power off. But they were miles ahead of me. Marvellous creatures. You have to admire them.

106
01:23:01,563 --> 01:23:03,066
But we've got to stop them!

107
01:23:03,259 --> 01:23:16,809
Oh, it's too late for that. They're the new species, you see. Taking over from homo sapiens. Man's had his day. Finished now.

108
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:29,139
The static circuit is nearly complete.

109
01:23:29,787 --> 01:23:33,708
Soon we can abandon the power we are using.

110
01:23:38,611 --> 01:23:41,952
The humans are being exterminated.

111
01:23:51,673 --> 01:23:53,873
Did you hear that? They're going to use their own power!

112
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:56,628
- No!
- Come on!

113
01:23:57,738 --> 01:23:58,707
- Don't be a fool 
- come on!

114
01:24:13,604 --> 01:24:14,539
Take it easy, Polly.

115
01:24:14,772 --> 01:24:18,491
Can't we do anything?! They're murdering everybody, one by one!

116
01:24:18,706 --> 01:24:21,320
You've done all this. Why did you give them power in the first place?

117
01:24:21,731 --> 01:24:36,513
Well, I could control it, you see. And then Janley got one of her men - Valmar, I think it was, yes - and he rigged up a secret cable. It's carrying power directly from the colony's supply.

118
01:24:37,213 --> 01:24:40,502
Where? Where is it, Lesterson?

119
01:24:40,792 --> 01:24:49,349
Valmar's the only one who can answer that. Or the Daleks of course. They know everything. Yes, you should ask the Daleks.

120
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:52,271
Then we must find Valmar.

121
01:24:52,385 --> 01:24:54,752
No! You stay here and look after Polly.

122
01:24:54,963 --> 01:24:55,861
I'll go.

123
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:32,906
You'll have to leave her now, Valmar.

124
01:25:36,242 --> 01:25:54,680
Section One? Where's your report? Are you there Section One? Section Two? Section Two? Why don't they answer? Can you hear me Section Two? Section Three? Oh, why don't they answer? I'm their Governor. Why don't they answer?

125
01:26:40,221 --> 01:26:54,954
This is Bragen speaking. I'm speaking to the Daleks. Daleks, listen to me. I am the Governor. You must work for me. Do not trust the rebels. I will give you whatever you want. But immobilise your guns. This is the Governor speaking.

126
01:26:56,283 --> 01:26:58,018
He's nuts, trying to talk to the Daleks.

127
01:26:59,533 --> 01:27:01,369
Lesterson, what's in that cupboard?

128
01:27:01,893 --> 01:27:03,459
Nothing. I think It's quite empty.

129
01:27:03,639 --> 01:27:05,225
Well, come on, Polly, we'll be safe in there, love.

130
01:27:05,885 --> 01:27:08,604
Do you hear me, Daleks?! You will obey my orders!

131
01:27:08,783 --> 01:27:12,377
No use, Bragen. The Daleks have stopped obeying your orders.

132
01:27:12,569 --> 01:27:13,746
Ah! Guards!

133
01:27:13,991 --> 01:27:19,213
Dead! The Daleks have killed them. You still have your guard units in the interior. How long will it take them to get here?

134
01:27:19,394 --> 01:27:20,215
That depends.

135
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:21,574
Well, get them!

136
01:27:21,744 --> 01:27:23,096
Well, they will be intercepted by the Daleks.

137
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:26,572
Exactly! It will draw them away from here and give the Doctor a chance to deal with them.

138
01:27:26,761 --> 01:27:28,901
I refuse to allow my guards to be sacrificed.

139
01:27:29,053 --> 01:27:33,556
In that case the Daleks will destroy everything on this colony.

140
01:27:37,003 --> 01:27:44,578
Guards. This is Bragen speaking. All units will report immediately to the capital. Be prepared to face the rebel Daleks.

141
01:27:45,421 --> 01:27:47,186
Ben! Polly!

142
01:27:47,558 --> 01:27:49,058
Doctor, did you hear what Bragen said?

143
01:27:49,234 --> 01:27:50,022
Yes, I did.

144
01:27:50,191 --> 01:27:51,873
Well I only hope the Daleks do go for the guards.

145
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:53,987
A lot of the Daleks went out just now.

146
01:27:54,292 --> 01:27:56,152
Good, because we're going inside. Come on Valmar. _.

147
01:27:59,256 --> 01:28:02,803
Ben, give us that spare cable over there. Polly, keep watch at the door.

148
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,905
Well, you know what you're doing?

149
01:28:06,076 --> 01:28:06,815
Of course I do!

150
01:28:06,967 --> 01:28:09,398
Well, why can't you just take all the plugs out and cut the power off?

151
01:28:09,543 --> 01:28:11,323
Because I prefer to do it my way!

152
01:28:11,902 --> 01:28:12,944
Look out!

153
01:28:19,772 --> 01:28:25,918
Static power is being stored. We can dismantle the human electric system.

154
01:28:26,174 --> 01:28:29,369
The law of the Daleks is in force.

155
01:28:29,612 --> 01:28:31,807
Extermination of humans.

156
01:28:34,455 --> 01:28:37,307
Our cables have been moved.

157
01:28:38,006 --> 01:28:40,974
And I could tell you who did it!

158
01:28:41,194 --> 01:28:43,487
What were you doing in there?

159
01:28:43,955 --> 01:28:46,155
I want to help you.

160
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:47,478
Why?

161
01:28:49,322 --> 01:28:52,748
I am your servant.

162
01:28:52,941 --> 01:28:56,052
We do not need humans now.

163
01:28:56,289 --> 01:29:01,330
Ah, then, but you wouldn't kill me. I gave you life.

164
01:29:01,564 --> 01:29:04,244
Yes, you gave us life.

165
01:29:36,508 --> 01:29:48,243
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!...

166
01:29:50,437 --> 01:29:58,747
Out of control..

167
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:42,880
What happened to it?

168
01:30:43,931 --> 01:30:44,940
I don't know.

169
01:30:45,223 --> 01:30:47,884
It seems that your friend, the Examiner, was successful after all.

170
01:30:51,165 --> 01:30:53,785
Now I shall restore law and order on this planet.

171
01:30:53,958 --> 01:30:55,871
Not your law, Bragen. That's finished for good.

172
01:30:56,023 --> 01:30:56,864
You'll obey me, or...

173
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:00,012
Your day is over, Bragen. No one will obey you now.

174
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:01,965
I'm still the Governor, and you will...

175
01:31:03,565 --> 01:31:04,649
Valmar.

176
01:31:10,407 --> 01:31:11,789
He was a murderer.

177
01:31:13,141 --> 01:31:14,227
Enough of guns.

178
01:31:14,625 --> 01:31:21,160
There's a lot of clearing up to be done. We will rebuild together. What is the extent of the damage?

179
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,025
Oh, I don't know if its repairable. The whole electrical system.

180
01:31:26,556 --> 01:31:27,611
Are you all right?

181
01:31:27,769 --> 01:31:29,224
Oh, he's OK. The clot knocked himself out.

182
01:31:29,563 --> 01:31:31,390
It's a miracle. How did you do it?

183
01:31:31,587 --> 01:31:32,615
Eh? What happened?

184
01:31:33,586 --> 01:31:35,385
You destroyed the Daleks, that's what you did!

185
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:39,090
Did I do that?

186
01:31:39,289 --> 01:31:40,124
You know you did!

187
01:31:40,299 --> 01:31:47,220
You used the power from the colony's electric supply - overfed it - and blew up their temporary static circuit. Well didn't you?

188
01:31:48,309 --> 01:31:49,521
Did I do all that?

189
01:31:49,803 --> 01:31:54,402
You may have stopped the Daleks, but have you any idea of the damage you've done to the colony?

190
01:31:55,113 --> 01:31:56,487
Oh. There was a blow back, was there?

191
01:31:56,683 --> 01:32:01,926
A blow back? Our power supply has been destroyed! It'll be months before we can get things back to normal.

192
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:02,781
Valmar!

193
01:32:02,949 --> 01:32:03,758
That is unfortunate.

194
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:05,606
But did it have to be this way?

195
01:32:05,798 --> 01:32:07,176
I did a lot of damage, did I?

196
01:32:07,554 --> 01:32:08,434
Come on.

197
01:32:11,781 --> 01:32:16,419
I think we'd better get out of here before they send us the bill.

198
01:32:25,753 --> 01:32:30,350
Oh, you needn't worry about them anymore, Doctor. Just a heap of old iron now.
