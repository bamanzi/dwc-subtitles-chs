00:00:43,347 --> 00:00:44,332
博士，看!
Doctor, look!

7
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:52,605
照亮. 去外面拿个电筒.
A light. A torch outside.

8
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:54,826
你看见了吗?
Did you see it?

9
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:55,929
快点 Ben, 快!
Quickly Ben, quickly!

10
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,047
是什么?
What was it?

11
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:17,852
能回答我吗?
Can you answer me?

12
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:21,772
好像是某种脱离下来的肢体，某种爪子. 好吓人!
It was a sort of disembodied hand. A sort of claw. It was horrible!

13
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,246
不. 不, 什么也没有.
No. No, there's nothing.

14
00:01:41,454 --> 00:01:43,253
你是对的 - 之前是有三个 Daleks.
You were right - there were three Daleks.

15
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:46,356
你知道那是什么?
Do you know what it was?

16
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,841
如果之前有三个，谁移动了?
If there were three, who moved it?

17
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,212
别问我. Lesterson?
Don't ask me. Lesterson?

18
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:01,577
但他还没有打开舱体啊.
But he hadn't opened the capsule.

19
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,798
他“说”他还没有打开．我们直接去找真相吧.
Now he said he hadn't opened it. Lets get our facts straight.

20
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:07,698
啊哈, 太棒了! 好想法，好想法.
Aha, excellent! Good thinking, good thinking.

21
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,694
什么, 那不是说你觉得他进去过?
What, does that mean you think he's been inside?

22
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:14,125
也许他一直在试验 Daleks? 啊
Perhaps he's been experimenting on the Daleks? Ah.

23
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:18,681
但是... 但他们是... 我是说他们已经死了. 肯定是!
But... but they're things I... I mean they're dead. They must be!

24
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,442
这盏灯是死的吧，现在看看!
This light is dead. Now the watch!

25
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:24,926
你是说这些东西只是需要能量?
Do you mean these things just need power?

26
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:33,941
嗯, Lesterson 太狂热了. 总督太在乎他自己的位置. 这让你想起什么了吗? 不知道. 没想过这个.
Now, Lesterson's fanatic. The Governor's jealous of his own position.
What does that suggest to you? Dunno. Hadn't thought about it.

27
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:38,541
这个基地所有事情都不太好，现在又多出来个 Dalek!
That all is not well with this colony. Add to that one Dalek!

28
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,157
噢, 天啊, you don't half make mountains, don't you? 就一个 Dalek?
Oh, blimey, you don't half make mountains, don't you? One Dalek?

29
00:02:41,358 --> 00:02:44,626
是的! 只要一个就可以彻底荡平整个基地了.
Yes! All that is needed to wipe out this entire colony.

30
00:02:53,934 --> 00:03:00,071
监察员? 监察员?
Examiner? Examiner?

31
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:07,104
Bragen, 你进屋之前从不敲门吗?
Bragen, don't you ever knock before you enter a room?

32
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:11,955
我很抱歉打扰了你. 我以为能在这里找到监察员，不是来找你的，Quinn.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I was expecting to find the Examiner here - not you Quinn.

33
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:17,122
那, 他不在这里. 如果你想要到床底下看看，我就不管你了.
Well, he's not here. You'll probably want to start snooping
under the bed, so I'll leave you to it.

34
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,403
等一下.
One moment.

35
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:20,400
别想在我这里试你的运气, Bragen.
Don't try your luck with me, Bragen.

36
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:26,306
相反, 我正在尽力避免麻烦. 总督已经明确说过你不能跟监察员接触
On the contrary, I'm trying to avoid trouble. The Governor
gave express instructions that you were not to contact the Examiner

37
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:31,306
但我发现你在这里，相信你能提供一个合适的解释.
I find you here. I'm sure you can offer some suitable explanation.

38
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,458
我能. 但不是对你.
I can. But not to you.

39
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:35,018
在你走之前... 哦!
Before you go... Oh!

40
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:39,048
不要再试图挡我的道.
Don't ever try to block my way again.

41
00:03:39,313 --> 00:03:40,125
保安!
Guard!

42
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,672
监察员不见了. 得马上找到他.
The Examiner is missing. He must be found immediately.

43
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:53,364
当然，真正的博士总是追着 Daleks 跑.
Of course, the real Doctor was always going on about the Daleks.

44
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:54,443
真正的博士?
Real Doctor?

45
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:57,466
真正的博士? 哦，你是说真正的博士.
Real Doctor? Oh, you mean the real Doctor.

46
00:03:57,777 --> 00:04:01,161
是的，我看到过那个爪子，我可不想跟那个东西握手, let's put it that way.
Yeah, now I've seen that claw thing, well,
wouldn't want to shake hands with it, let's put it that way.

47
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:04,115
博士，你看, 如果他们有那么危险的话，你打算拿他们怎么办?
Doctor, look, if they're that dangerous, what are you going to do about it?

48
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:16,683
让我喘口气. Lesterson 会听吗? 哦, 哦. Lesterson listen.... 锻炼一下舌头. 试试 Lesterson listen...
Save my breath. Would Lesterson listen? Uh, uh. Lesterson listen..
Exercises the tongue. Try it! Lesterson listen...

49
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:21,671
看，他们认为你是监察员, 让他们把 Daleks 都销毁吧! 就这样，把你的权利都用上.
Look, they think you're the Examiner, order them to destroy the Daleks!
Well, chuck your weight about.

50
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,865
Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

51
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,620
Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

52
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,160
你觉得你在干什么?
What do you think you're doing in here?

53
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,763
Listen, listen...

54
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:32,197
谁给你的权限?
Who gave you permission?

55
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:34,639
读读这个! 大声读!
Read this! Aloud!

56
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,672
授予所有权限.
Accord every access.

57
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:42,298
正确! 它并没说＂除了你的实验室＂，是吧? 除非使用小号字印的.
Exactly! It doesn't say 'except your laboratory' anywhere, does it?
Unless it's in micro-print.

58
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,068
我应该先问问的!
I should have been asked first!

59
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:47,559
当时你往舱体里看的时候，首先注意到的是什么?
What was the first thing you noticed when you looked inside that capsule?

60
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:48,548
嗯, 是... 是... 是 Daleks.
Well, th... th... the Daleks.

61
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:49,604
你被吓着了吧?
You were astounded?

62
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:50,089
是的．
Yes.

63
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:50,607
感到有点奇怪?
Amazed?

64
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,171
是的.
Yes.

65
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:57,514
你却没有看过他们一眼! 为什么? 因为你曾经到里面去过，看见过他们!
You didn't even give them a glance! Why?
Because you'd been in there and seen them!

66
00:04:58,075 --> 00:05:00,621
第三个 Dalek 哪里去了?
Where is the third Dalek?

67
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:02,469
我不知道你在说什么!
I don't know what you're talking about!

68
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:17,347
你没经过允许就打开了舱体. 你发现了隔间里有三个 Daleks
You opened up the capsule without permission.
You found the inner contart... compartment containing three Daleks

69
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,347
你弄走了一个，藏了起来!
You took one of them away and you hid it!

70
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:13,390
藏起来? 简直... 胡说八道!
Hid it? What... what nonsense!

71
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,202
我能问问这是怎么回事吗?
May I ask what all this is about?

72
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:20,606
我们打开舱体里面的隔间时，Lesterson 早就进去过了.
We opened an inner compartment in the capsule,
and Lesterson had already been in there.

73
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:22,081
我不否认这个.
I don't deny that.

74
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:23,326
他偷了一个 Dalek!
And he's nicked a Dalek!

75
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,364
Dalek?
Dalek?

76
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:28,742
这是监察员给这个两个金属生物起的名字，我在舱体里面发现的那两个生物.
It's the name the Examiner has given to two metal creations
that I've discovered inside the capsule.

77
00:05:28,902 --> 00:05:30,163
他们很危险，很邪恶.
And they're dangerous. Evil.

78
00:05:30,337 --> 00:05:32,813
金属肿块而已! 非常不活跃.
Lumps of metal! Quite inactive.

79
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:35,715
那是你的想法，伙计．如果你看过...
That's what you think, mate. If you'd seen...

80
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,760
我想这是我作为一个科学家的指责，检查和调查这些东西．
I consider it's my duty as a scientist to...
to examine and investigate these objects.

81
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:47,760
现在请离开我的实验室，你们全部．别想染指我的实验!
Now please, all of you, keep out of my laboratory.
Keep your hands off my experiments!

82
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,338
那些＂金属肿块＂ - Daleks - 我期望他们坏掉，溶掉．我不关心什么方法，但要毁掉．
Those 'lumps of metal' - Daleks - I want them broken up, or melted down.
Up, or down, I don't care which, but destroyed!

83
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:54,710
我拒绝．
I refuse to allow it.

84
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:00,189
我是地球监察员 - 我要求这样.
I'm an Earth Examiner - I demand it.

85
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:01,799
这已经超过你的授权范围了.
You're exceeding your authority.

86
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:05,598
或许我们该问问总督的意见？我要马上见他!
Perhaps we should ask the Governor about that?
I wish to see him immediately!

87
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:06,862
那可能比较困难.
That might be difficult.

88
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,747
但不是不可能. Ben, Polly.
But not impossible. Ben, Polly.

89
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:19,596
他能够停掉这些实验不?
Could he stop the experiments?

89
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,9805
我不知道. 这不关你们的事. 你去把 Janley 叫过来.
I don't know. It's none of your business.
You go and get Janley and then come back here.

90
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,305
我们没有... 没有时间浪费. 去吧，快，快!
We haven't... haven't got any time to waste.
Now go on man, quickly, quickly!

91
00:06:55,003 --> 00:07:03,675
他可阻止不了我实验．一定有什么方法让你活过来 - 我要找到方法.
He won't stop me experimenting. There must be some way
to bring you back to life - and I'm going to find it.

92
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,628
当然你有权限访问任何地方.
And of course you do have the right of any access.

93
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:09,542
这就是为什么我有一块这样的牌子.
Which is why I have a badge which says so.

94
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:11,827
Lesterson 像一只母鸡一样看着他的创意.
Lesterson watches over his ideas like a mother hen.

95
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:18,750
如果地板上有个炸弹，还有５分钟就要爆炸了, 你在踹坏地板之前会不会先问我是否可以.. 啊, 水果!
If there was a bomb under this floor timed to go off in five minutes,
would you ask my permission before you ripped up the floorboards.. aha, fruit!

96
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:19,675
谢谢你.
Thank you.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,834
监察员 - 这当然由你决定，但我建议你调查的时候慎重一下. 现在不是一个好的时间点.
Examiner - It's up to you of course, but I'd advise a little discretion
in your investigations. It's not a very good time, just now.

98
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:31,556
谢谢. 当前这些风风雨雨...
Thank you. With all these disturbances...

99
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:32,523
风风雨雨?
Disturbances?

100
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:40,528
是的, 一些小的破坏活动, 结党叛乱, 秘密报纸, 没什么太重要的. 但也让总督闲不下来
Yes, minor acts of sabotage, rebel cliques, secret newspapers,
nothing important you understand, but it keeps the Governor busy.

101
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:43,828
我毫不怀疑他会自己跟你说的, 我安排一下你们的会见．
I have no doubt he'll tell you about it himself when I arrange your meeting with him.

102
00:07:44,852 --> 00:07:45,806
打算在什么时候?
When will that be?

103
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,944
啊, 他先要对基地全面巡视一下... 我看看他去之前能不能见你一下.
Ah, he's going on a tour of the perimeter of the colony.
I'll... I'll find out if he can see you before he goes.

104
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:53,314
谢谢.
Thank you.

105
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:05,585
看, 这是像这样的小事才让人难以相信你就是博士.
You know, it's little things like this
that make it difficult to believe that you're the Doctor.

106
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:06,333
啊.
Ahh.

107
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:09,624
另外一个，我是说. 真的那个. 喔, Nuts(呸/坚果)，你知道我什么意思.
The other one, I mean. The proper one.
Oh nuts, you know what I mean.

108
00:08:09,811 --> 00:08:12,406
坚果(Nuts)? 是的,当然, 我们有了. 要饼干吗?
Nuts? Yes, certainly, here we are. Crackers?

109
00:08:13,464 --> 00:08:16,660
你，我的古瓷器(china), 是个赝品!
You, my old china, are an out and out phoney!

110
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:21,897
中国(China), 是的, 我相信我曾经去过那里，碰到了马可波罗!
China, yes, I went there once I believe. Met Marco Polo!

111
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:26,143
不是，不是中国(China). 是瓷器(china)! 瓷器和盘子，朋友.
No, not China. China! China and plate, mate, friend.

112
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:27,922
是的，马可波罗是朋友? 我相信他是.
Yes, Marco Polo a friend? I believe he was.

113
00:08:28,212 --> 00:08:30,630
别听他的，博士. 我知道你是谁.
Don't listen to him, Doctor. I know who you are.

114
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:31,669
嘘!
Shh!

115
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:51,175
啊, 这是个...
Ah, it's a...

116
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,579
诺, 诺, 几个小虫子. 小麦克风.
Well, well, a touch of the bugs. Microphones.

117
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:10,506
有人在偷听我们说话!
Someone's been listening to what we were saying!

118
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:13,162
是的, 这就是为什么你在满口说些乱七八糟的话!
Yes, so that's why you were messing about and talking nonsense!

119
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:14,141
我从不胡说!
I never talk nonsense!

120
00:09:14,462 --> 00:09:15,048
嗯, 嗯, 嗯.
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

121
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:16,047
嗯~, 基本没有.
Well, hardly never.

122
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:18,196
他们相信我们还呆在屋子里，是吧?
Well, they certainly believe in making us at home, don't they?

123
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,300
一开始, 我就想可能不止一个.
At first, I thought there might be more than one.

124
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:26,898
我打赌是那个老Charlie Bragen 干得!
Here, I bet old Charlie Bragen did it!

125
00:09:27,174 --> 00:09:27,726
是叫 Charlie 吗?
Charlie?

126
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:29,341
但是 Fred 这个名字不太适合他啊，是吧?
Well Fred wouldn't suit him would it?

127
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:33,322
如果他没做过，你觉得那是他自己的想法吗? 我是说 - 他可能是收到了命令.
If he did do it, do you think it was his own idea? I mean
- he could have been under orders.

128
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:36,647
你说可能来自总督? 啊, 我不知道. 你怎么想，博士?
You mean from the Governor? Ah, I don't know. What do you think, Doctor?

129
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:40,894
哦，是的. 当然. 我们... 我们先来看一下这个纽扣.
Oh, yes. Yes of course. Let's... let's consider this button for a moment.

130
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:46,894
这是我们手上关于监察员被害的唯一线索，那个真监察员.
It's the only clue we've got to the murderer of the Examiner.
The real Examiner.

131
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:49,694
唔. 谁要求他来这里的?
Hmm. And who asked for him to come?

132
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,911
Lesterson对于那个舱体的疯狂举动. 他不想让任何人打听.
Hmm. Well, Lesterson's crackers about that capsule.
He wouldn't want anyone nosing about.

133
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,295
Bragen 说总督那边一直麻烦缠身.
Bragen said the Governor's been having trouble.

134
00:09:55,541 --> 00:10:00,637
好，先排除他. 总督都是一样的，他不会请求援助. 如果他发这样的信息，会让他看起来不能正确自己处理.
Naw, rule him out. Governors are all the same, he wouldn't ask for help.
If he sent the word it would look as if he couldn't do the job properly.

135
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:01,647
是的
Yes.

136
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,815
我建议先回到 TARDIS, 我有点受够了.
Oh, well, I vote we go back to the TARDIS, I've had enough of this dump.

137
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:09,502
是吗? Daleks 怎么办?
Have you? What about the Daleks?

138
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,865
他们是死的.
Well, they're dead.

139
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:14,089
我们在舱体里面看到的那个东西是怎么一回事 - 那可是活的.
Well, what about that thing we saw in the capsule - that was alive all right.

140
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:16,173
没法解释那个.
Well, can't explain that.

141
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:20,988
我能. 而且那就是为什么我们还不能走!
I can. And that's why we have to stay!

142
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:29,667
他们很丑陋的畜生是吧? 嘿, 他到底瞎倒腾这些干什么呢? 别管这个了, 要我说.
Ugly-looking brutes aren't they? Hey, what's he want to
muck about with them for? Leave well alone, that's what I say.

143
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,600
你就适合做个助手．别理这个? 如果这个星球上都是你这样的人, 我们不会有任何进展.
You're a fine one to be a research assistant. Leave well alone?
There'll be no progress on this planet with people like you around.

144
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,235
我们现在就要干这个, 否则你们这些家伙就会把事情搅乱. 
We're doing all right as we are.
Or we were until your lot came along stirring things up.

145
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:45,235
你们跑不掉, 你知道的. 总督对于你们叛乱的事情全知道, 当他准备好之后会碾碎你们.
You won't get away with it, you know. The Governor knows all about you rebels.
He'll smash the lot of you when he's ready.

146
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,191
总督?
Governor?

147
00:10:46,257 --> 00:10:46,895
对, 总督!
Yeah, the Governor!

148
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:48,364
他不可能碾碎...
He couldn't smash...

149
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:54,947
能不能安静一下! 你们俩以为自己是谁? 这是间科学实验室，请别把政治带进来.
Will you be quiet! Where do you both think you are?
This is a scientific laboratory. Kindly keep your politics out of it.

150
00:10:55,587 --> 00:11:02,447
快点, Resno. 伙计, 动起来. 我们没有那么多时间.
Come on, Resno. Man, get on with it. We haven't got all day.

151
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:05,347
我们得在总督阻止我们之前搞定这个.
We've got to get this working before the Examiner stops us.

152
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:07,447
他有点害怕这些东西.. 这些 Daleks?
He's got some phobia about these.. these Daleks?

153
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:21,236
我知道他们的悲剧 - 毁灭. 但还有更恐怖的事情 - 我记不太清楚了.
I know the misery they cause - the destruction.
But there's something else more terrible - something I can only half remember.

154
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:25,583
博士, 到底是什么?
Doctor, what was it?

155
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:31,305
总督在哪儿? 他说了什么?
Well? Where is the Governor? What did he say?

156
00:11:31,563 --> 00:11:36,441
他传达了歉意, 监察员．他今晚不能见你, 但期望明早第一个见你.
He sends his apologies Examiner. He can't see you tonight,
but he hopes to see you first thing in the morning.

157
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,967
哦, 但也许不用等那么久, Charl ... 哦, Bragen.
Well, it might not wait that long, Char... ah, Bragen.

158
00:11:40,237 --> 00:11:41,302
还真早不了.
It will have to.

159
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,485
抱歉.
Excuse me.

160
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:43,858
你要去哪儿?
Where are you going?

161
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:45,224
当然是去见总督.
To see the Governor, of course.

162
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:51,541
恐怕不可能．一旦他的门关上了, 没有人, 即便是你监察员, 也不允许进入他的房间!
I'm afraid that's not possible. Once his door is closed,
no-one, not even you, Examiner, is allowed into his room!

163
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,141
好吧.
Very well.

164
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,206
谢谢. 那就明早吧.
Thank you. Until the morning then.

165
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:05,389
这里发生了什么?
What happens now?

166
00:12:06,651 --> 00:12:14,196
我应该联系地球. 那个叫 Hensell 的总督肯定听他们的 - 我得让地球支持我.
I shall radio Earth. Governor or not, Hensell will have to
listen to them - I'll get Earth to back me.

167
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:28,709
太搞笑了. I could have sworn. 你们呆在这里, 我很快回来.
That's funny. I could have sworn. You stay here, I shan't be long.

168
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:40,070
开始连接.
Connecting now.

169
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:44,566
所有连接正常.
All connections responding.

170
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:46,784
完全没反应?
Nothing at all?

171
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:47,750
没.
No.

172
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:48,872
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

173
00:12:49,105 --> 00:12:49,970
这里完全没问题.
There's nothing wrong here.

174
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:50,949
我们来看看.
Well, let's see.

175
00:12:51,178 --> 00:12:52,464
真的. 我连表盘都不会读啊.
Really. If you can't trust me to read a dial.

176
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:58,980
安静. 好了 - 我们再试试. 这次我们调高到 3.24. 听到了吗 Janley?
Be quiet. All right - we'll try again.
This time we'll take it up to 3.24. Got that Janley?

177
00:12:59,188 --> 00:13:00,444
3.24.
3.24.

178
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:05,738
开始动了!
It's moving!

179
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:18,115
现在记下来, Janley. 一号附着物吸盘有反应. 二号附着物没动.
Now, note this, Janley. Number one attachment with sucker stick
responding. Number two attachment not moving.

180
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:23,115
三号附着物镜头有反应. 看看这些读数, Resno.
Number three attachment with lens responding. Watch these meters, Resno.

181
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:24,184
还有反应.
Still responding.

182
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:30,143
现在, 有理由假定这个有吸盘的棍子有着手一样的功能.
Now, it's reasonable to assume that this the sucker stick
acts like some kind of a hand.

183
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:34,540
没事 - 别大惊小怪. 我们只给了临时的能量.
It's all right - don't be alarmed. We've only introduced temporary power.

184
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:40,540
我们得打开它才能彻底搞明白它是怎么工作的.
We shall have to be able to open it up
before we could find how it works permanently.

185
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:42,689
这东西有一点吓人.
It's a bit frightening.

186
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:48,799
是的. 现在我没法想出这个短臂是干什么的.
Yes. Now, I cannot think what this short stubby arm is for.

187
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,764
这些镜头会是眼睛吗?
Could the lens attachment be an eye?

188
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:59,350
是的, 是的. 很有可能是． 啊, 这个叫做Dalek的东西... 肯定有某种directing influence.
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now it's quite possible that this, ah, Dalek...
Now there must be some kind of directing influence.

189
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:09,350
这里甚至可能有一个简化的大脑. 正电子的, 我不会奇怪的. 要是我们能打开它就好了!
There may even be a simplified brain. Positronic,
I shouldn't wonder. If only we could open it up!

190
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:12,931
现在怎么办?
Now what?

191
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:14,987
所有都可以工作了.
Everything functioning here.

192
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:19,378
是的, 也许某个地方有能量泄露. 我们再试试.
Yes. Well, perhaps the power is leaking away somewhere.
We'll... we'll try again.

193
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:45,271
看它的眼睛!
Look at the eye-stick!

194
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:46,480
它在看我们!
It's watching us!

195
00:14:46,857 --> 00:14:47,745
荒谬.
Don't be absurd.

196
00:14:47,964 --> 00:14:48,886
真的. 我看见了!
It was. I saw it!

197
00:14:49,127 --> 00:14:57,164
你不能说＂在看我们＂. 你这样会让我们觉得... 这东西好像有智力似的. 继续干活去吧!
You can't use the phrase 'watching us'. You'll have us believing that
th... the thing has intelligence next. Now, get on with your work, man!

198
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:53,852
我就知道你在这里.
I know you're there.

199
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:58,652
监察员, 谢天谢地, 是你啊. 你一到这里我就想来跟你谈谈.
Examiner, thank goodness, it's you.
I've been trying to talk to you ever since you got here.

200
00:15:58,854 --> 00:16:03,051
这里发生了什么? 又是你.
What's happening here? You again.

201
00:16:03,277 --> 00:16:04,293
你想要什么?
What do you want?

202
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:06,265
我发现操作员没知觉了.
I found the operator unconscious.

203
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:10,766
我也发现了! 我正看着他, 就听见有谁在走动了. 肯定是你.
So did I! I was just looking at him, when I heard someone move.
It must have been you.

204
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,681
那些是...?
And those?

205
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,365
我刚捡起来的. 这都是怎么了?
I picked them up. What is all this?

206
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:18,078
这些线缆被剪断了.
The cables have been cut.

207
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:19,102
啊?
What?

208
00:16:22,722 --> 00:16:28,418
这很严重. 不仅仅是内部通讯出了问题了，我们跟地球的联系也被切断了.
This is serious. It's not just our own communications.
We're cut off from Earth as well.

209
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,452
想干这个的只能是那些叛乱分子.
The only people who'd want to do that are the rebels.

210
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:33,439
你的那些四肢发达的小伙子要是有点脑子的话, 就能防止这些事情发生了.
Those muscle boys of yours had any brains,
they'd stop things like this.

211
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:40,093
Bragen, 我刚着陆就被攻击了. 这是我当时采集到的一个证物.
Bragen, I was attacked just after I landed.
This is a small souvenir I collected.

212
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:43,542
这个纽扣是你的吧?
This button belongs to you, doesn't it?

213
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:44,917
哦，是的.
Well, yes.

214
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:49,024
你说这个东西是你捡到的? 我觉得破坏通讯的也是你...
And you say you picked these up?
I suggest that you were sabotaging the communications...

215
00:16:49,264 --> 00:16:49,839
那是瞎说!
That's a lie!

216
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,476
...还攻击了其中一个工程师. 有这些证据，我得让总督过一会儿再走.
...having first attacked one of the engineers.
I'd detain the Governor on evidence like that.

217
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:55,995
我期望你没打算让我过一会儿再走, Bragen.
I hope you're not thinking of detaining me, Bragen.

218
00:16:56,186 --> 00:17:00,533
我没得选. 发生了这样的事, 我不可能再让你乱跑, 是吧? 过来，保安.
I've no option. I could hardly let you run around loose
after this, could I? All right guards.

219
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:01,876
我警告你, Bragen!
I warn you, Bragen!

220
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:08,424
好吧 - 这轮你赢了. 我们看看到了总督面前怎么说.
All right - you win this round, Bragen.
We'll see what it looks like in front of the Governor.

221
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:15,055
总督会安排一个质询的. 我能问问你在这里干什么吗?
The Governor will want an enquiry.
May I ask what you were doing here?

222
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:26,811
好. 我已经将能量导向别处了. 这次调高到 4.68. 呃... Resno, 你得在摄像机和表盘两边跑了.
Right. I've redirected power. This time working up to 4.68.
Eh... now Resno, you will have to dodge between the camera and your meters.

223
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:27,979
就绪.
Ready.

224
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,540
建立连接.
Connecting, now.

225
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,140
所有连接正常.
All connections responding.

226
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:37,003
很好.
Excellent.

227
00:17:37,238 --> 00:17:37,982
行了!
It's working!

228
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,190
很好. 录下来, 现在就录, Resno. 对了, 记一下数据, Janley.
Excellent. Film it, film it now, Resno.
And, note the readings, Janley.

229
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:49,503
看来它对你有兴趣, Resno.
It seems to be interested in you, Resno.

230
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:52,488
你是怎么回事?
What's the matter with you man?

231
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:57,498
我告诉你它是有智能的. 他在看着我, Lesterson. 在打量我! 我能感觉到!
I tell you it's intelligent. It's watching me,
Lesterson. Weighing me up! I can sense it!

232
00:17:57,768 --> 00:17:58,643
别傻了.
Don't be a fool.

233
00:17:58,863 --> 00:18:00,817
我不喜欢这样, 我跟你说．我不知道这些东西能做出什么事情来．
I don't like it I tell you. I don't know what these things can do.

234
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:06,809
不, 我们永远不可能知道, 除非我们把它的每一个反应都拍下来. 继续你的工作, 伙计!
No, and we never shall know, shall we, unless we take film
of every reaction. Now get on with your work, man!

235
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,396
Resno!
Resno!

236
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,107
没事．他没死.
It's all right. He isn't dead.

237
00:18:25,463 --> 00:18:26,168
发生了什么?
What happened?

238
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,759
被冲击波震晕了.
Knocked out by the shock waves.

239
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,621
我们必须带他去医院, 我去叫人来帮忙.
We must get him to the hospital. I'll go and get help.

240
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,432
我们要帮 Quinn 作证
But we've got to defend Quinn.

241
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:13,644
是的,  我知道． 他是无辜的,  至少在证明他有罪之前．但他有罪.
Yeah, I know. He's innocent until he's proved guilty. But he is guilty.

242
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:15,249
他是副总督!
He's the Deputy Governor!

243
00:19:15,496 --> 00:19:22,221
那又怎样? 我那会儿有个小头目被撸下来, 就只因为没交公交车费! 而且他这还是有动机的, 别忘了动机.
So what? I had a headmaster once who got nicked for not paying
his bus fare! And then there's the motive, don't forget the motive.

244
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,089
比如说是什么?
Like what for instance?

245
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:27,908
首先, 他是副总督, 对吧? 也许他想当总督.
Well, he's the Deputy Governor, right? Maybe he wants to be Governor.

246
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,560
哦, 这太荒谬了!
Oh, that's ridiculous!

247
00:19:29,763 --> 00:19:33,517
那, 外衣纽扣总不荒谬吧! 而且他在通讯室里面被抓住时手里正拿着一把钳子
Well, the jacket button wasn't! And he was caught red-handed
in the Communications Room with a pair of pliers,

248
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:36,117
别跟我说他是拿那东西来剪眉毛的.
and don't tell me he was plucking his eye-brows either.

249
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:39,910
有些人你知道他们是没有问题的，你看见他们的样子就知道.
Look, there are some people you know are all right.
You just know by looking at them.

250
00:19:40,253 --> 00:19:44,284
早上好. 质询马上要开始. 我被派来带你们过去.
Good morning. The enquiry is about to begin.
I've been sent to escort you.

251
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:48,315
你好 Janley.
Hello Janley.

252
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:49,617
到时间了吗?
Is it time?

253
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:53,146
是的, 我觉得到了. 我感到很兴奋.
Yes. Yes, I think so. I feel quite excited.

254
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:54,885
当然是. 这是个了不起的成就.
So you should. It's a wonderful achievement.

255
00:19:55,104 --> 00:20:02,549
是的是的. 但最棒的是, Janley, 我们不知道这个实验的范围. 谁知道我们能走多远.
Yes, yes. But the wonderful thing, Janley, is that we don't know the full scope of this experiment. Who knows where we may go from here.

256
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:05,768
谁知道这 Dalek 可能做什么?
Who know what this Dalek may do?

257
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:07,028
它应该是无害的吧?
It's harmless now?

258
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:13,098
是的, 是的. I... 我已经去除了... 哦, Resno, 你今天见到 Resno 了吗?
Yes, yes, yes. I... I've removed... Oh, Resno, have you been to see him today?

259
00:20:13,455 --> 00:20:14,317
见过.
Yes, yes.

260
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:15,024
怎样?
And?

261
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:17,345
他... 他在医院治疗呢. 他很快就没事了.
He... he's had medical attention. He's going to be all right.

262
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:18,395
哦, 那就好.
Oh, good.

263
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:24,434
最好没人发现这起事故，否则可能会让监察员找到他们想要的借口，他就能停掉这个项目.
No one must find out about this accident. It might give the Examiner
just the excuse they want, and he could stop the whole project.

264
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:28,975
嗯, 是是是, 你说的对.
Well, yes. Yes, yes, yes, you're right.

265
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:32,173
准备好了?
Well. Ready?

266
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,169
好了! 我们开始，让他们大吃一惊.
Yes! Let's go and surprise them.

267
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:46,794
我很抱歉没能早点见你，监察员。请坐。
I am sorry I couldn't see you earlier, Examiner. Please sit down.

268
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:55,794
Quinn, 我跟你一样不喜欢这个. 你都做什么了?
Well, Quinn, I don't like this anymore than you do.
What have you been up to?

269
00:20:56,286 --> 00:20:58,079
什么也没有做.
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

270
00:20:58,397 --> 00:21:02,463
那， Bragen 的报告是怎么回事? 这些是事实证据, Quinn. 现在，你还有什么要说的?
Well, what about Bragen's report then? These are facts, Quinn.
Now, what have you got to say about it?

271
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:04,660
那个工程师说是我打了他?
Does the engineer say I hit him?

272
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:06,210
他是被人从后面袭击的，他能怎么说?
How could he if he was hit from behind?

273
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:07,576
那就只有间接证据了.
Then its only circumstantial evidence.

274
00:21:07,777 --> 00:21:13,532
监察员也在水银沼泽被人袭击了。这里有一颗你衣服上的纽扣，是在监察员手里找到的.
The Examiner was also attacked in the mercury swamp.
We have a button from your jacket, found in the Examiner's hand.

275
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:15,730
这个我没法解释.
I can't explain that.

276
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:16,991
我肯定你没法!
I'm sure you can't!

277
00:21:17,373 --> 00:21:18,308
监察员.
Examiner.

278
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,081
你好像有两个大脑.
You seem to be in two minds.

279
00:21:21,384 --> 00:21:22,737
对, 还有两个身体.
Yeah, and two bodies.

280
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:27,479
你向 Bragen 提及了 Lesterson 发现的那些机器... 你管他们叫什么来着?
You mentioned to Bragen that these machines of Lesterson's...
What do you call them?

281
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,541
他们本来的名字 - Daleks
I call them what they are - Daleks.

282
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:34,290
啊, 是是是, Daleks. 你说他们可能有动机破坏我们的通讯设施.
Ah, yes, yes, yes, Daleks. You say they could be a motive
for destroying our communications.

283
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:35,352
我说过.
I do.

284
00:21:35,716 --> 00:21:37,968
Lesterson, 这是一场特别的质询. 请你...
Lesterson, this is a special enquiry. Now please.

285
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,182
等不急了. 你不会失望的!
This won't wait. You won't be disappointed!

286
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:40,813
你听到我说什么了 Lesterson!
You heard what I said Lesterson!

287
00:21:40,855 --> 00:21:46,575
总督，我已经完成了一项实验，可给基地带来革命. 听我多说两句.
Governor, I've just completed a... an experiment
which could revolutionise the whole colony. Bear with me.

288
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,972
Lesterson, 你完成什么了？你完成什么了?
Lesterson, what have you done? What have you done?

289
00:21:49,231 --> 00:21:52,627
我给你演示一下. Janley, 开始!
I'll show you. Janley, now!

290
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:30,843
它认出了博士. 它认得他.
It recognised the Doctor. It recognised him.

291
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:33,385
你怎么啦，博士? 有什么不舒服吗?
What's the matter, Doctor? Are you all right?

292
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:36,925
蠢人. 愚蠢之极.
The fools. The stupid fools.

293
00:22:37,337 --> 00:22:39,945
你害怕啦! 它能干什么?
You're scared! What can it do?

294
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:41,574
目前还没有.
Nothing yet.

295
00:22:41,947 --> 00:22:44,357
它知道你是谁! 虽然听起来很疯狂，但是真的.
It knew who you were! It sounds crazy, but it did.

296
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:45,458
知道我过去是谁.
Knew who I was.

297
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:48,825
Dalek 知道你现在是谁.
The Dalek knows who you are.

298
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:50,630
这个生物叫做, 按我的理解, 叫做 Dalek. 现在看看. FIXME
This creation is called, I understand, a Dalek. Now, look at it.

299
00:22:50,986 --> 00:22:55,930
我只不过给了一点电力, 但它能够储存它．FIXME
I have merely given it electrical power. 
But it is capable of storing it.

300
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:03,000
它还能对命令做出响应. 转一圈. 移动那个椅子.FIXME
Moreover, it responds to orders. Turn around. Move that chair.

301
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:18,423
停. 看见了吧. 想想这能给我们的挖矿, 流水线, 打包工作带来什么.FIXME
Stop. You see? Well, just think what this could do for our...
our mining program, our processing, packaging.

302
00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:23,423
无数的劳工啊, 总督. 它甚至可以终结这个基地的所有问题.
Dozens of labour jobs, Governor.
It may even supply the end to all this Colony's problems.

303
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:28,293
是的, 它可以终结这个基地的所有问题, 因为它可以终结这个基地!
Yes, it will end the colony's problems, because it will end the colony!

304
00:23:28,757 --> 00:23:33,292
我-是-你的-仆人.
I am your servant.

305
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:41,187
它... 它说话了! Janley, 你听到了吗? 它真的会说话!
It... it spoke! Janley, did you hear it? It can actually talk!

306
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:47,931
它能做很多事情, Lesterson. 但它干得最有效率的事情是终结人的生命.
It can do many things, Lesterson. But the thing it does
most efficiently is exterminate human beings.

307
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:57,931
它毁灭人类, 毫不留情, 毫无内疚. 它毁灭人类. 绝对地. 完全地. 毁灭人类.
It destroys them, without mercy, without conscience.
It destroys them. Utterly. Completely. It destroys them.
