1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,005
Sincro: wyxchari

2
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:46,098
I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant.

3
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:50,318
So Lesterson, they're even capable of speech!

4
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,670
Yes. But then, why not? After all, they have a certain intelligence.

5
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:56,735
Yes I know, but...

6
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,541
But is... is it... it is... an intelligence that we can control.

7
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:03,922
So what you want is permission to continue your experiments?

8
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:08,900
Governor, think what it would mean if we were to set it to work in the mines. It could double our production overnight!

9
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,095
Consider the effects it could have on our whole economy.

10
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:22,457
Yes, and the effect of that on Earth... Yes. Yes, they could be very grateful.

11
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:26,278
I shall stop you. I will!

12
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,905
All right Lesterson, permission granted.

13
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:32,255
Permission? Permission for what?

14
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:34,261
To continue my work, Examiner.

15
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:39,193
But... But didn't you all hear what I said? The Daleks must be destroyed!

16
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,995
Ho, ho. Never!

17
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:45,597
Very well. If not by my order - then by Earth's! Come Ben, Polly.

18
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:52,752
Ah, Examiner. Just a moment. Tell me, why are you so against this project?

19
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:57,946
But I've told you! I realise I can't give you any proof, but you've no idea of the danger!

20
00:01:58,126 --> 00:01:58,733
No.

21
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:06,479
Yes. Danger! I shall be contacting Earth just as soon as radio communications have been restored.

22
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:11,483
You're my servant, are you?

23
00:02:11,869 --> 00:02:13,186
I... I am.

24
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:29,070
Very well. Immobilise yourself. Go on. I order it! Immediately!

25
00:02:36,892 --> 00:02:37,620
Huh!

26
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,027
Lesterson.

27
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,826
Why did you stop obeying? You were given an order.

28
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,050
He has gone.

29
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:50,898
Then you obey only...

30
00:02:51,097 --> 00:03:05,556
His order was wrong. I cannot serve human beings if I am immobilised. You gave me power. Your orders are right. I serve you.

31
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:13,309
Lesterson. Lesterson, it reasons. Just how limited is its intelligence?

32
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:24,494
Now, there is no cause for... for concern, Governor. Just you wait until you see the amount of work it can do! And now, I'm really going to put you through your paces. Follow me, Dalek.

33
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:26,755
I obey.

34
00:03:38,712 --> 00:03:39,600
That's it!

35
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:41,811
We should have stayed with Quinn.

36
00:03:42,027 --> 00:03:45,204
Well, we couldn't have helped him Polly, even if we'd wanted to. The Governor's already reached his verdict.

37
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:46,039
Wire. Scissors. Tape.

38
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:48,800
But he didn't murder the real Examiner. I'm sure he didn't.

39
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:55,332
Oh, well. The way I see it this lot's too busy arguing amongst themselves to do much about anything. Anyway, first things first. The Daleks are the important thing!

40
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:57,897
Ah! Congratulations, Ben!

41
00:03:58,246 --> 00:03:59,600
What'd I do? What'd I do?

42
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:03,129
You just used your brains, that's what you did. The Daleks are the most important thing!

43
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,815
I still think Quinn's innocent.

44
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:09,675
How can I be in league with the rebels?

45
00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:11,040
The evidence confirms it.

46
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,641
It was I that warned of their dangers.

47
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:13,750
As part of your overall plan!

48
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,277
You wouldn't even take the matter seriously.

49
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:16,946
If I was wrong then, I have a chance to rectify it now!

50
00:04:17,316 --> 00:04:20,997
If that's going to be your attitude, I suggest that we...

51
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:28,209
Quinn! Let us conduct this inquiry in an orderly manner. Now, the Examiner was attacked, there can be no question of that.

52
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,016
And the button grabbed by the Examiner was missing from your suit.

53
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:33,698
Yes, if you've got anything to add to that, you'd better say it now.

54
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,191
I didn't attack the man. I had no reason to. I was the one that sent for him!

55
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,021
You sent for him?!

56
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:46,316
It was necessary. Under the circumstances, I'd hardly be likely to sabotage the radio communications.

57
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:48,840
But... but why Quinn? Why?

58
00:04:49,194 --> 00:04:50,325
Because of the rebels!

59
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:53,052
The rebels! They're nothing more than one or two fanatics.

60
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:54,256
You know as well as I do that they...

61
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:58,472
Unless you're trying to create trouble here - to undermine the Governor's position.

62
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:02,066
Bragen, you'd better explain that.

63
00:05:02,394 --> 00:05:09,480
If you're removed, who takes your place? The Deputy Governor, of course. And that's the real reason behind all this trouble, isn't it Quinn?

64
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:10,326
Go on.

65
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:16,113
You attack the Examiner in the mercury swamp and blame it on the rebels. Then you sabotage the radio - blame that on the rebels too.

66
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:18,652
Get him out of my sight!

67
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:21,764
Hensell, before you listen to these preposterous allegations...

68
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:35,267
I chose Quinn myself. I trained him for the job. Why, in a few years time, he'd have had this seat!

69
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:38,627
Sometimes Governor, a few years is a long time to wait.

70
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:43,697
Oh, Bragen?

71
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:44,831
Governor?

72
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:52,473
You will assume Quinn's duties. As of now, you are Deputy Governor.

73
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,313
Ah!

74
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:02,697
I hope you know what you're doing!

75
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:04,628
So do I!

76
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,658
Excellent. excellent.

77
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,767
But I thought we were after the Daleks, not this control unit you've nicked!

78
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:26,878
If only we could find a... Ah, yes!

79
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:33,127
He's a right little delinquent, isn't he?

80
00:06:33,412 --> 00:06:35,657
Doctor, what on Earth are you up to?

81
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:37,423
Ooh!

82
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:40,926
Ah! Now we're really getting somewhere!

83
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,381
Look Doctor, I don't want to appear dim, but how's this going to do the Daleks in?

84
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:51,397
They think that Lesterson's the driving force, but I don't. The Daleks are using him.

85
00:06:51,757 --> 00:06:52,631
But how?

86
00:06:52,872 --> 00:07:01,913
Problem. Smash the Daleks, and the people here will lock us up or kill us. Let the Daleks go, and we'll all be exterminated.

87
00:07:02,877 --> 00:07:05,644
We could just go back to the TARDIS. At least we'd be safe to think there.

88
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:07,589
Oh yes, that's coming on.

89
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:10,556
Oh, you talk to him, will you?

90
00:07:10,794 --> 00:07:13,704
Doctor look, if you told us what you were up to, perhaps we could help you.

91
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:24,349
Mustn't underestimate any of them. Lesterson's a first class scientist, first class. He opened the capsule. He realised that the Daleks could be reactivated.

92
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:32,447
Yeah, that could be the answer. Let's kidnap Lesterson, and hide him away for a bit. Well, it would stop him bringing the Daleks back to life, wouldn't it?

93
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:35,461
I thought it was pretty bright.

94
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:36,834
There we are.

95
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:38,491
What is it?

96
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,371
What is it? It could be the answer to all our problems.

97
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,978
Ah Examiner, don't let them fool you about the rebels. They're strong.

98
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,132
Try and find out where they hold their meetings.

99
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,430
Leave him alone!

100
00:07:56,873 --> 00:07:59,311
It's all right, Polly.

101
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,304
We'll help him Polly, but later.

102
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:02,283
Yes but...

103
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:09,379
Now, this is a case where a little injustice is better than wholesale slaughter. What we want is in Lesterson's laboratory. Come along.

104
00:08:11,827 --> 00:08:15,522
Incredible! Well, let's move on to test fourteen.

105
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:17,509
I am ready.

106
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:23,016
When sodium acts on ethyl alcohol, what is the resulting derivative?

107
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:29,519
Sodium ethoxide. C2 H5 ONA.

108
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:34,366
Just five seconds, Janley! Just the time it took to speak the answer.

109
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,394
Right too.

110
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:47,323
But of course it's right! Look, can you imagine what kind of positronic brain this robot has, Janley? Think of the store of knowledge that it must carry. Sulphuric acid.

111
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:49,987
H2 SO4.

112
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:52,002
Ah, you see?

113
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:53,395
May I come in?

114
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:54,583
What do you want?

115
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:57,151
Oh, ah, just to see how you're getting on.

116
00:08:57,493 --> 00:08:58,095
If you think...

117
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:03,003
No, please! I'm... I'm not here to cause trouble. I... I'm just interested, that's all.

118
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:05,962
You've done nothing but meddle and interfere ever since you landed on Vulcan.

119
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:12,307
Well, I... I did give you permission to open up the capsule, now didn't I? Please, carry on.

120
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:14,877
And you won't try to stop me?

121
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:25,299
Stop you? No, of course not. We get off on the wrong foot, Lesterson, but... but I'm a reasonable man and... and I've been thinking, perhaps I was hasty.

122
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:28,717
Well, if you... if you... if you really want to call a truce.

123
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:32,224
A truce? My dear fellow, I... I'd like to be friends!

124
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:36,669
Yes. Yes. Very well, you may stay.

125
00:09:36,986 --> 00:09:43,561
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Perhaps you'd like to amuse yourselves for a little while.

126
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:50,699
Laboratory. Yes.

127
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,511
All right, I can come now. Right.

128
00:10:03,822 --> 00:10:06,655
I just have to slip out for a few minutes, Lesterson, alright?

129
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,801
Ah, yes, yes. Um, very well then. Examiner, shall we test its knowledge of physics?

130
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:15,151
Oh, oh, splendid, splendid. Ah, huh, please, please, carry on.

131
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:19,251
Thank you. D... what is the First Law of Thermodynamics?

132
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:43,702
When heat is transformed into any other kind of energy or vice versa, the total quantity of energy remains invariable. That is to say, the quantity of heat which disappears is equivalent to the quantity of other kind of energy produced...

133
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,670
Fool! What do you think you're doing?

134
00:10:46,984 --> 00:10:48,009
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!...

135
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:49,835
I'm saving your life!

136
00:10:50,655 --> 00:10:52,008
Get out! Get out!

137
00:10:53,064 --> 00:10:56,491
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... I have, ah, sustained no damage.

138
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:05,825
It's all right to _?

139
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:09,475
You were able to get away then?

140
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:12,509
Yes. Lesterson's with the Examiner. And Hensell?

141
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:15,591
At a meeting of production managers. He left me in control.

142
00:11:16,705 --> 00:11:18,509
We could take over the colony now.

143
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:25,304
No. No it has to be absolutely right. I don't want to take over a colony full of rebels do I, Janley?

144
00:11:25,544 --> 00:11:27,972
Well, I don't know. You're making me help them.

145
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:39,026
Only to stir them up to create enough trouble to get rid of Hensell, and then... and then we crush them. The whole colony will be grateful, and I'll be Governor.

146
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:42,914
Is that the gun you told me of?

147
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,719
Can you persuade the rebels this will help them?

148
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:48,920
Yes, Valmar thinks he can work in a switch to turn it on and off.

149
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:50,312
How powerful is it?

150
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:57,461
It killed Resno, Lesterson's assistant, and Lesterson believes that Resno's simply shaken up - taking a few days off.

151
00:11:57,822 --> 00:11:58,647
And the body?

152
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:12,141
In the mercury swamp. Lesterson was the indirect cause of Resno's death. It's a good hold over him if he makes trouble. I'll give this to Valmar then?

153
00:12:12,905 --> 00:12:13,578
Yes.

154
00:12:14,071 --> 00:12:15,120
When do we move?

155
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,152
I need another card in my hand. The Examiner bothers me.

156
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:20,890
I thought Quinn was the danger.

157
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:27,725
Uh, not any more. The Examiner is no fool. No, there has to be something else.

158
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:33,625
Well?

159
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:36,222
Well, he's not in the laboratory, Lesterson's by himself.

160
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,939
Hmm. He must have gone another way. Can I leave it you? I'm going to go back to the rest room.

161
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:40,830
Well, but...

162
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,441
Well, somebody's got to clear it up.

163
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:43,356
Okay.

164
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,785
Hello there.

165
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,750
Hello. Um, you're Lesterson's assistant aren't you?

166
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:57,156
Yes. You're not looking for the Examiner are you?

167
00:12:57,538 --> 00:12:58,943
Well, do you know where he is?

168
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:02,557
Yes, he's waiting to get a message through from Earth. He's in the Communications Room.

169
00:13:03,331 --> 00:13:03,881
Umm...

170
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,556
Oh, you'll find it easy enough. Look. Around, then to your right, in the next block.

171
00:13:08,814 --> 00:13:09,516
Thanks very much.

172
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:21,209
Doctor? Anyone here?

173
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:33,250
Well done Valmar. Hold her. Hold her.

174
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:39,056
There, that'll keep her quiet for a bit.

175
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:41,572
I've no idea who she is. She was just snooping around.

176
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:45,629
I sent her. We want her kept out of the way. Get a couple of your men to keep her in a safe place.

177
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:48,648
Now, this is what I told you about.

178
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,636
Yes. The lethal power must come from here.

179
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:53,641
Uh, huh.

180
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:55,424
It should have quite a good range.

181
00:13:55,674 --> 00:13:56,744
Can you fix it?

182
00:13:56,978 --> 00:14:00,555
It's easy. This could win us the revolution.

183
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:01,714
Ahh...

184
00:14:17,698 --> 00:14:24,110
She said she was coming back here. She knew the way, and she wouldn't have wandered off. I know she wouldn't! Oh!

185
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:30,118
Ben, if you were a Dalek what would be your next move?

186
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,929
I'm talking about Polly.

187
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:34,883
Oh, no, no, no, no. She's a clever girl, but she couldn't answer this.

188
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:36,256
But she is missing!

189
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,583
Oh, no, no, no.

190
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:39,054
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!

191
00:14:39,353 --> 00:14:45,412
No, no, no! She's looking around, there's a lot to see in the colony. She's interested. I like that.

192
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:49,239
Come on.

193
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,531
Where are we going?

194
00:14:50,763 --> 00:14:53,287
To report it. If we make a fool of ourselves, I don't care! We report it!

195
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:06,510
Yes, yes, yes. I managed to stop that fool of an Examiner just in time. You know there are some people here who believe that you're an enemy.

196
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:09,693
I am your servant.

197
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:17,771
What does this machine do?

198
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:23,236
You know, it's amazing. You have an almost human interest and curiosity.

199
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:33,153
A Dalek is bet... is not the same as a human. If I am to help, I must know everything.

200
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:34,684
Yes. Yes, of course.

201
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:36,767
What is this machine?

202
00:15:37,074 --> 00:15:40,374
It computes meteorite storms as they approach our weather satellites.

203
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,614
How accurate is it?

204
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:47,985
About, ah, seventy percent. It helps to cut down on our satellite losses.

205
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:54,002
Daleks can build pu... computers with one hundred percent accuracy.

206
00:15:54,397 --> 00:15:55,770
One hundred percent?

207
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:03,070
If you provide materials and our own power unit, a computer will be built.

208
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:08,603
A hundred percent. That would be an enormous saving for the... for the colony!

209
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:11,329
Then, you will get the materials?

210
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,180
I'll go and speak to the Governor at once.

211
00:16:13,411 --> 00:16:18,647
I will be ready to dictate the blueprint when you return.

212
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:22,267
Huh, huh. Oh, that's marvellous!

213
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:57,655
You agreed we'd go and see Bragen.

214
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,093
Hmm? Power.

215
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:01,156
Come on then!

216
00:17:01,757 --> 00:17:04,125
Now the energy intake for Daleks should be the cube...

217
00:17:06,697 --> 00:17:07,399
Now then...

218
00:17:07,856 --> 00:17:09,415
Well, now what are you at?

219
00:17:09,713 --> 00:17:12,254
Talk to yourself.

220
00:17:12,735 --> 00:17:15,252
Oh, it's useless with incomplete data!

221
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:25,228
Lesterson!

222
00:17:25,514 --> 00:17:25,875
Eh?

223
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:29,254
He just went past. That means we can get into his laboratory again.

224
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:30,318
But we're looking for...

225
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:32,171
Oh, come along, Ben. Come along.

226
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:40,622
There's somebody in there.

227
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:44,150
What are you doing here?

228
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:49,003
Stand aside. Servants shouldn't question.

229
00:17:49,307 --> 00:17:51,166
Entry is restricted.

230
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:54,645
Not for me it isn't. "Accord every access". I've got a badge.

231
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,156
That is an order.

232
00:17:56,431 --> 00:17:59,651
A Dalek order. Short circuit the generator, Ben.

233
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:05,529
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Stand back!

234
00:18:05,757 --> 00:18:09,675
Don't be frightened of it Ben. It's not armed. I'm going to see what it was doing in there.

235
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:23,887
Ben, let's get out of here!

236
00:18:24,914 --> 00:18:26,877
Fool. Lesterson must have reactivated them.

237
00:18:27,085 --> 00:18:33,041
Yes. When I say run, run like a rabbit. Run!

238
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:45,061
I have sent the human being for materials.

239
00:18:45,303 --> 00:18:46,416
And power?

240
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:54,509
Yes. Power we can turn into static, then we will conquer.

241
00:18:54,833 --> 00:19:02,925
We will conquer... We will conquer... We will conquer...

242
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,150
But if you didn't do it Lesterson, then the Dalek must have used your power supply and reactivated the others itself.

243
00:19:08,365 --> 00:19:10,071
I was going to do that anyway.

244
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,586
Are you off your head, mate? Those two are armed!

245
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:17,456
Then we turn off the electricity, disarm them, and then everything is safe again.

246
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:18,906
I've already explained to you.

247
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:26,592
Stop these arguments, both of you. I've had enough. I've every confidence in Lesterson. He has carte blanche for the Daleks from now on.

248
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:28,483
But they must be destroyed!

249
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:35,216
Bragen, I'm making a tour of the perimeter. I put you in direct charge here. See that Lesterson gets everything he wants, will you?

250
00:19:36,112 --> 00:19:40,404
I shall need a permanent guard on my laboratory, Bragen.

251
00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:47,187
Don't worry about the Examiner. I think I can keep him quiet.

252
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,011
We've been forgetting about Polly.

253
00:19:54,289 --> 00:20:01,116
Greed and ambition, that's all it is. Wait till they find out what their precious production figures have cost them!

254
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:03,345
Oh, I want to see you.

255
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:05,440
What about?

256
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,707
Well it's Polly, she's missing. We can't find her anywhere.

257
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:11,670
I'll tell one of my men to make enquiries. It shouldn't take long to find her.

258
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:12,824
Ah, thanks.

259
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:23,661
Examiner, some of my men have found a body in the mercury swamp. It was the body of a middle-aged man.

260
00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:25,651
What is that to do with me?

261
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:29,377
You're the Examiner - or maybe you're not.

262
00:20:36,143 --> 00:20:38,140
Just exactly what do you mean by that?

263
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:41,787
Who are you? Quinn's friends? Come to stir up rebellion?

264
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:46,031
There's only one possible way that you could know I'm not the Examiner.

265
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:49,226
Yeah, by knowing what the real Examiner looked like!

266
00:20:49,568 --> 00:20:58,094
Exactly, Ben. Exactly! Only two people knew of his arrival on this planet. Myself and his murderer.

267
00:20:58,421 --> 00:20:59,424
That's enough!

268
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,004
Is it? Doctor, we've got to tell the Governor.

269
00:21:02,264 --> 00:21:08,699
Do you think he'll believe you? I'll soon convince him that you murdered the man yourself. You stole the Examiner's badge.

270
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:16,277
Then why don't you arrest us? Because there's a doubt isn't there? Because it might, it just might, go against you.

271
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:24,353
All right, all right, so neither of us wants to make a move. But you leave Lesterson alone - and the Daleks!

272
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,056
He'd make a right Father Christmas, wouldn't he?

273
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:37,102
Oh, I'd rather fight a hundred of his sort than just one Dalek.

274
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,742
Listen to this. "The girl is safe. She will remain so as long as you leave the Daleks alone".

275
00:21:57,661 --> 00:21:59,785
And did you disarm the other two?

276
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:06,436
Yes. We are your servants. We do not need guns.

277
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,445
I'm very glad. I knew the Examiner was wrong about you.

278
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,835
Did you get our materials?

279
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,651
Yes. Everything you need you can have.

280
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,248
And a power plant?

281
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:19,407
Everything.

282
00:22:28,784 --> 00:22:32,122
We will get our power.

283
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:41,823
We will get our power. We will get our power. We will get our power. We will...
