00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:35,445
His face, his hair - look at it!
他的脸，他的头发，你看!

6
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:38,913
He's breathing...
他还在呼吸...

7
00:01:40,156 --> 00:01:42,044
...and the TARDIS seems to be normal.
...而且TARDIS看起来很正常

8
00:01:43,823 --> 00:01:46,391
Ben, what are we going to do? We can't just leave the Doctor there.
Ben, 我们该怎么办? 我们不能把博士扔那儿不管.

9
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:49,260
What, him? The Doctor?
什么, 他? 是博士?

10
00:01:53,578 --> 00:02:00,468
Ben, do you remember what he said in the tracking room?
Something about "This old body of mine is wearing a bit thin. "
Ben, 你记得他在跟踪室内说过什么吗? 好像说＂我的旧身体穿了身新皮囊. "

11
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,863
So he gets himself a new one?
这么说他有了个新的?

12
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:04,281
But it's impossible!
但这不可能啊!

13
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:07,616
Not so long ago we'd have been saying that about a lot of things.
不久以前，我们还对好多事情都说不可能

14
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:10,886
It's over.
过去了

15
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,463
It's over.
过去了

16
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:01,797
What are we going to do?
我们该做点什么?

17
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,652
It is the Doctor. I know it is... I think.
他是博士. 我就知道... 我觉得.

18
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:09,942
It's not only his face that's changed
- he doesn't even act like him.
不仅仅是他的脸变了 - 他的行为也不像.

19
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,977
Come on, it's time we sorted this out.
来吧，我们把这事搞清楚.

20
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:17,706
Now look here!
现在看这儿!

21
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:18,759
Hold that.
停住.

22
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,395
And tilt it.
斜点儿

23
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,517
Have you done with this?
完事了吗?

24
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,842
Put it down, put it down.
放下，放下.

25
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:44,385
Now, what's the game?
现在，玩什么游戏?

26
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:45,279
Ah!
啊!

27
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:48,318
The crusades, from Saladin.
十字军，撒拉丁

28
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:51,394
The Doctor was a great collector, wasn't he!
博士是个收藏家啊!

29
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:52,891
But you're the Doctor!
但你就是博士啊!

30
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,365
Oh, I don't look like him.
哦，我看着不像他.

31
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:57,228
Who are we?
我们是谁?

32
00:03:57,627 --> 00:03:58,632
Don't you know?
你不知道吗?

33
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:04,284
Extermination!

34
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:11,042
Now look, the Doctor always wore this.
So if you're him, it should fit now, shouldn't it?
看，博士总戴着这个，如果你是他，这个应该大小合适，对不对?

35
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:14,729
There - that settles it.
看 - 掉下来了.

36
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:18,616
I'd like to see a butterfly fit into a chrysalis case
after it's spread its wings.
我想看看蝴蝶展开翅膀后怎么适应它的蛹

37
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:20,111
Then you did change!
你真的变了!

38
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,727
Life depends on change... and renewal.
生命依赖于变化... 和新生.

39
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:28,297
The Doctor kept a diary, didn't he?
博士持有一本日记，对吧?

40
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:29,562
Yes.
是的.

41
00:04:29,776 --> 00:04:32,079
I thought so. Now, I wonder where?
我记得是，不过现在在哪儿呢?

42
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:34,054
I wonder where?
在哪儿呢?

43
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:36,568
He's a very different Doctor, Ben.
他真跟博士有点不同, Ben.

44
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:39,350
Yeah, maybe. Just where do we stand, though?
嗯, 很可能. 不过我们现在到底什么情况?

45
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:06,134
Doctor? Doctor, what's going to happen to us?
博士? 博士, 我们会怎样?

46
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:14,746
I think... I think we must have landed for sometime.
I think it's time we went for a stroll.
我觉得... 我觉得我们着陆有一阵子了. 我觉得我们该出去逛逛了.

47
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:17,482
But you don't know where we've landed!
但你都不知道我们着陆到哪里了!

48
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,767
No, you haven't checked the oxygen or the temperature or anything!
别，你还没有检查氧气和温度，什么都没还没检查!

49
00:05:21,976 --> 00:05:30,453
Oxygen density one-seven-two, radiation nil, temperature...
eighty-six - strong suggestion of mercury deposits.
氧气浓度172，辐射零，温度86. 有较强的水银沉淀.

50
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:34,953
Satisfied, Ben? Now, are you two coming or are you not?
满意了吗, Ben? 现在，你们两个来还是不来?

51
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:39,494
He does know us! He said "Ben", didn't you hear him?
他真认识我们! 他喊你 "Ben", 听到了吧?

52
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,163
Yeah, I heard.
是的, 我听到了

53
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:50,782
Are you coming, you two?
来不来，你俩?

54
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:51,836
Hello?
哈罗?

55
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:57,193
Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello?
哈罗? 有人吗? 哈罗?

56
00:05:57,823 --> 00:06:01,950
Hello? Why don't they come?
哈罗? 他们怎么还不来?

57
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:08,474
Ah, so you've come at last. I'm from Earth. I'm the Examin...
啊, 你终于来了. 我从地球来的. 我是监察员...

58
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:43,141
"Earth Examiner. Accord every access. Vulcan. "
"地球监察员. 授予所有权限. Vulcan. "

59
00:06:51,517 --> 00:06:52,771
Whoa, they're hot!
喔, 好热!

60
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:54,998
Hmm, do you think the air's like this everywhere?
唔, 是不是到处的空气都像这样?

61
00:06:55,253 --> 00:07:00,102
Nah - might be just round here.
Don't want too many lung full of it, I know that.
不 - 可能只是这一片才这样. 别使劲吸气, 我知道的.

62
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:06,902
Here, when I was a kid, we used to live opposite a brewery.
You could take a walk and get tipsy all in one go!
我小的时候住在一家酒坊对面. 还没走完一趟人就醉了!

63
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,765
It's beautiful!
好美啊!

64
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:10,239
No, don't touch it, Polly!
别，别碰, Polly!

65
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:11,769
I wasn't going to.
我没打算碰.

66
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:14,140
No, it's quicksilver - it gets through the pores.
这是水银 - 会从这些气泡里面出来.

67
00:07:14,498 --> 00:07:19,343
Where is the Doctor, or whatever he is, got to?
博士要去哪儿啊? - 就算他是博士吧

68
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:39,685
So the murdered man was the real Examiner?
所以被谋杀的人就是真的监察员?

69
00:07:40,472 --> 00:07:41,942
Well, didn't you see who did it?
那么，你有没有看到是谁干的?

70
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:44,877
The Doctor got this button though.
博士, 这里多了颗纽扣.

71
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,613
Well, I think it's pretty dull around here.
I don't know why we don't just go back to the TARDIS.
我觉得这挺无聊的. 我不明白我们为什么不回到 TARDIS 去.

72
00:07:48,912 --> 00:07:52,938
Doctor, are you going to let them think you're the real Examiner?
博士，你是想让他们觉得你就是真正的监察员吗?

73
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:56,787
Well, won't that be dangerous?
嗯，那会不会比较危险?

74
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:00,659
Look, why don't you stop blowing that thing and talk to us properly?
看，你能不能不再吹那个，认真跟我们说说?

75
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:01,348
Ben!

76
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:02,582
Now don't you start - it's bad enough with him!
你现在别说话 - 跟他在一起就够糟的了!

77
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:03,579
Well, he hasn't done anything.
他什么也没做.

78
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:06,612
No, that's just the trouble!
He knows what happened back at the TARDIS,
不，那就是麻烦所在! 他知道那会儿 TARDIS 里发生了什么

79
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:10,612
yet will he tell us? Will he come out and say?
Will he admit to being the Doctor?
他会告诉我们吗? 他会站出来说? 他会承认他就是博士?

80
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,027
Come in!
请进!

81
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:21,691
I am Hensell - the Governor.

82
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:24,684
If Earth had seen fit to warn us you were coming...

83
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:30,071
If Earth didn't warn you we were coming, Governor,
they must have had a very good reason. I wonder what it was?
如果地球没告诉你，总督，他们一定有一个很好理由. 我很好奇到底是什么?

84
00:08:30,271 --> 00:08:35,954
Now look here - I run this Colony. I'm entitled to know
why you've come to Vulcan. What is your brief?
你看 - 我负责这块基地. 我有权知道你为什么到 Vulcan 来. 简单说说?

85
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,202
I am the Examiner.
我是监察员.

86
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:38,834
Why are you here?
为什么来这儿?

87
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:43,749
To examine. And I intend to start my examination at once!
监察. 我现在就要开始检查!

88
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:49,950
Someone's leaked reports about these rebel groups
- that's it, isn't it?
有人密报说这里有人叛乱，是为了这个吧，是吗?

89
00:08:50,618 --> 00:08:52,207
There is Lesterson's capsule.
应该是 Lesterson 的那个舱体.

90
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,646
Internal affairs are my business, Bragen.
Please don't interfere!
内部事物归我管， Bragen. 请不要来干扰我们!

91
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,267
Please go on.
请继续.

92
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:03,017
The capsule. It was found in a mercury swamp.
It must have been here for centuries before the Earth colony arrived.
这个舱体，是在一个水银沼泽里发现的. 可能在那里已经几个世纪了, 比地球殖民者还早

93
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:06,739
I felt it might be dangerous, it might contain bacteria.
我觉得它可能很危险, 它可能带有细菌.

94
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:09,806
I shall examine the capsule.
我应该检查一下这个舱体

95
00:09:33,461 --> 00:09:34,359
Where did you get this?
你在哪里得到这个的?

96
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,293
It dropped from the capsule.
从舱体上掉下来的.

97
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:36,650
Dropped?
掉下来?

98
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:40,160
Yes, when it was being hauled into the laboratory.
是的, 把它拖进实验室的时候.

99
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,960
But, you can see! This metal could revolutionise space travel.
不过，你看! 这种金属可以会对我们的太空旅行技术产生革命性影响.

100
00:09:45,099 --> 00:09:49,860
That's why I'm insisting that we open it.
Well, who knows what other marvels there may be inside?
这也是为什么我坚持要打开舱体. 谁知道里面还有什么其它神奇的东西?

101
00:09:50,115 --> 00:09:52,462
But Lesterson, I didn't think you could open it?
不过 Lesterson, 我没想到你能打开它?

102
00:09:52,979 --> 00:10:01,131
Well, I have a theory. I'm convinced that the opening mechanism
on the other side is either here, or here.
我有一个理论. 我推断打开的方法是在两端，要么这边，要么这边.

103
00:10:01,815 --> 00:10:03,080
Extermination...
终结!...

104
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:08,349
Now, my theory is that I can insert a laser ray in this ridge here.
我的理论是可以在这个背脊处注入激光束.

105
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:13,708
The ray spreads, fuses the opening device and gets us in.
光束散开, 触发开门设备，我们就可以进去了.

106
00:10:14,686 --> 00:10:17,194
Examiner, I shall have to make it your responsibility.
监察员, 我觉得该你来决策了.

107
00:10:17,698 --> 00:10:20,402
A laser? Why not? It shouldn't be too difficult.
激光? 没问题啊，不会太难.

108
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:30,585
Well, we'll try the other side.
我们来试试另外一边.

109
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:51,103
Hmm, it's a bit... disappointing.
唔, 有一点... 让人失望.

110
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:53,692
Not really. This is just an entry bay, isn't it?
不会. 这只是门廊, 对吧?

111
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,008
Yes, I... I suppose so.
是的... 我觉得是.

112
00:10:56,374 --> 00:10:57,860
Well, this doesn't get us very far does it?
那并没有让我们走多远是吧?

113
00:10:58,131 --> 00:11:01,051
Ah, getting into the rest of the capsule will take time, Governor.
进到舱体其它部分就需要时间了，总督.

114
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,608
Well, can't you use that torch thing again?
That must be an opening door.
你不能再用一下那个光束吗?那肯定是一个门.

115
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,544
Well, I should have to measure it up
and find out where the lock mechanism is.
我得考察一下，看看锁机关在哪儿.

116
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,312
And I think we'll leave it for tonight.
我觉得今晚就到此为止吧.

117
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:09,123
Leave it?
到此为止?

118
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:11,312
Leave it for tonight? But what did we come here for?
就这样了? 那我们来这儿干什么?

119
00:11:11,574 --> 00:11:12,930
That is my decision, Governor.
这是我的决定，总督.

120
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:14,313
But, good heavens above, man!
但是，苍天在上!

121
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:16,403
Two hundred years, you say, this has been buried?
两百年，你说它被埋了?

122
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,866
Oh, at least. Now, there must be something in the inner compartment.
哦，至少有. 里面的隔间里一定有什么东西.

123
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,690
We shall be able to find out where it came from originally.
我们应该可以搞明白它是从哪里来的.

124
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:24,535
It didn't come from this planet - Vulcan.
它并不是来自这个星球 - Vulcan.

125
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,351
Oh no, no, no. The metal is quite alien.
哦，不不不. 这个金属很外星.

126
00:11:27,638 --> 00:11:33,371
Alien, yes. Very alien. Goodnight.
外星，是的. 非常外星. 晚安.

127
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,980
What's he up to now?
他这是要干什么?

128
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,064
Ben, we're not going to let him out of our sight.
Ben, 不要让他离开我们的视线.

129
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,845
Well, Lesterson, you got your way. Was it worth
sending for this Examiner? This idiotic Examiner?
好了，Lesterson, 你有路子. 不过你找来这监察员值得吗? 就这个愚蠢的家伙?

130
00:11:50,155 --> 00:11:51,888
I didn't send for him. I thought you did.
不是我找来的. 我还以为是你呢.

131
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:55,490
Why don't you let me talk to the Examiner, Hensell?
I can find out what's he's here for.
你为什么不让我跟监察员说话，Hensell? 我能找出他来这里的原因.

132
00:11:55,663 --> 00:11:58,920
No, no, no, no, you keep away from him.
We'll leave him to work with Lesterson here.
不不不, 你离他远点. 我们让他跟 Lesterson 呆一起吧.

133
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:01,920
We've all got enough to do without having to worry about
some amateur critic from Earth interfering.
我们都有太多事情要做，负担不起来自地球的业余批评.

134
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,633
But with five minutes, I _...
但只要５分钟, 我 _...

135
00:12:02,731 --> 00:12:06,897
You heard what I said, Quinn.
You won't mind keeping the Examiner busy, Lesterson?
你听到我的话了, Quinn. 你不介意让监察员忙得团团转吧, Lesterson?

136
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:11,197
我不介意你跟他做什么 ... 只要他的鼻子别到我的事情里面来到处嗅.
I don't mind what you do with him so long as you keep his nose...
out of our business.

137
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:12,241
Yes. All right.
好. 没问题.

138
00:12:12,546 --> 00:12:14,152
All right. Well, we shall talk about it tomorrow.
就这样. 我们明早再讨论.

139
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:28,841
Ben!

140
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:30,159
What?

141
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:31,609
Shh! He's in the corridor.
嘘! 他在走廊里.

142
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:32,369
Who is?
谁?

143
00:12:32,605 --> 00:12:33,994
The Doctor, you clod! Come on - quick!
博士, 你个笨蛋! 过来 - 快!

144
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:41,663
He's going towards Lesterson's lab.
他往 Lesterson 的实验室去了.

145
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,595
Of course - to the space capsule!
当然 - 那个太空舱!

146
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:44,601
Come on.
来吧

147
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:50,211
Polly, Ben, come in and meet the Daleks.
Polly, Ben, 进来见见 Daleks.

148
00:13:50,516 --> 00:13:51,301
What?
什么?

149
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:52,983
The Daleks.
Daleks.

150
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:13,036
You could have opened this before.
你以前就打开过这个.

151
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:15,061
These two pieces of metal are identical.
这两块金属是一样的

152
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,967
I knew I should find them here.
我就知道能在这里找到它们

153
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:21,062
Ah, they look harmless, not very lively.
啊, 他们看起来是无害的, 并不活跃.

154
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:26,679
Two hundred years in a swamp and you wouldn't look very lively
either. Nothing could live through that, could it?
你想什么呢? 在沼泽里呆200年，你也看起来不活跃. 没有什么东西能熬过来，是吧?

155
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,692
Live?
活的?

156
00:14:27,922 --> 00:14:29,451
Nothing human, no.
不是人类, 不.

157
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:31,319
Doctor, look!
博士，看!

158
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:33,974
What's the matter?
怎么回事?

159
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,057
Well, there were three Daleks in here!
What's happened to the other one?
这里本来有三个 Daleks 的! 另外一个发生了什么?

160
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:44,139
Doctor, look!
博士, 看!

161
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:52,412
A light. A torch outside.
要光. 去外面拿个电筒.

162
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:54,633
Did you see it?
你看见了吗?

163
00:14:54,881 --> 00:14:55,736
Quickly Ben, quickly!
快点 Ben, 快!

164
00:14:55,947 --> 00:14:56,854
What was it?
是什么?

165
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:17,659
Can you answer me?
能回答我吗?

166
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:21,579
It was a sort of disembodied hand.
A sort of claw. It was horrible!
好像是某种脱离下来的肢体，某种爪子. 好吓人!

167
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,053
No. No, there's nothing.
不. 不, 什么也没有.

168
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:43,060
You were right - there were three Daleks.
你是对的 - 之前是有三个 Daleks.

169
00:15:44,615 --> 00:15:46,163
Do you know what it was?
你知道那是什么?

170
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,648
If there were three, who moved it?
如果之前有三个，谁移动了?

171
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,019
Don't ask me. Lesterson?
别问我. Lesterson?

172
00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:01,384
But he hadn't opened the capsule.
但他还没有打开舱体啊.

173
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,605
Now he said he hadn't opened it.
Lets get our facts straight.
他“说”他还没有打开．我们直接去找真相吧.

174
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,505
Aha, excellent! Good thinking, good thinking.
啊哈, 太棒了! 好想法，好想法.

175
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:11,501
What, does that mean you think he's been inside?
什么, 那不是说你觉得他进去过?

176
00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:13,932
Perhaps he's been experimenting on the Daleks? Ah.
也许他一直在试验 Daleks? 啊

177
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,488
But... but they're things I...
I mean they're dead. They must be!
但是... 但他们是... 我是说他们已经死了. 肯定是!

178
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:20,249
This light is dead. Now the watch!
这盏灯是死的吧，现在看看!

179
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:24,733
Do you mean these things just need power?
你是说这些东西只是需要能量?

180
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:29,748
Now, Lesterson's fanatic. The Governor's jealous of his own position.
嗯, Lesterson 太狂热了. 总督太在乎他自己的位置

181
00:16:30,018 --> 00:16:34,348
What does that suggest to you? Dunno. Hadn't thought about it.
这让你想起什么了吗? 不知道. 没想过这个.

182
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:38,348
That all is not well with this colony. Add to that one Dalek!
这个基地所有事情都不太好，现在又多出来个 Dalek!

183
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:40,964
Oh, blimey, you don't half make mountains, don't you? One Dalek?
噢, 天啊, 你不用这样疑神疑鬼的吧，不就一个 Dalek?

184
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:44,433
Yes! All that is needed to wipe out this entire colony.
是的! 只要一个就可以彻底荡平整个基地了.

185
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,478
Examiner?
监察员?

186
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:01,311
Bragen, don't you ever knock before you enter a room?
Bragen, 你进屋之前从不敲门吗?

187
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:06,162
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I was expecting to find the Examiner here - not you Quinn.
我很抱歉打扰了你. 我以为能在这里找到监察员，不是来找你 Quinn 的

188
00:17:06,388 --> 00:17:07,429
Well, he's not here.

189
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:10,713
The Governor gave express instructions that you were not to contact the Examiner
总督已经明确说过你不能跟监察员接触

190
00:17:10,908 --> 00:17:14,813
I find you here. I'm sure you can offer some suitable explanation.
但我发现你在这里，相信你能提供一个合适的解释.

191
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:16,965
I can. But not to you.
我能. 但不是对你.

192
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:20,179
The Examiner is missing. He must be found immediately.
监察员不见了. 得马上找到他.

193
00:17:20,904 --> 00:17:23,622
Doctor, look, if they're that dangerous,
what are you going to do about it?
博士，你看, 如果他们有那么危险的话，你打算拿他们怎么办?

194
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:31,590
Save my breath. Would Lesterson listen? Uh, uh. Lesterson listen...
让我喘口气. Lesterson 会听吗? 哦, 哦. Lesterson listen....

195
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:36,190
Exercises the tongue. Try it! Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen....
锻炼一下舌头. 试试 Lesterson listen...

196
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:40,478
Look, they think you're the Examiner, order them to destroy the Daleks! Well, chuck your weight about.
看，他们认为你是监察员, 让他们把 Daleks 都销毁吧! 就这样，把你的权利都用上.

197
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:44,372
Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

198
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,127
Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

199
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:47,667
What do you think you're doing in here?
你觉得你在干什么?

200
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:49,270
Listen, listen...

201
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:51,704
Who gave you permission?
谁给你的权限?

202
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,146
Read this! Aloud!
读读这个! 大声读!

203
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:56,179
Accord every access.
授予所有权限.

204
00:17:56,532 --> 00:18:01,805
Exactly! It doesn't say 'except your laboratory' anywhere,
does it? Unless it's in micro-print.
正确! 它并没说＂除了你的实验室＂，是吧? 除非使用小号字印的.

205
00:18:02,055 --> 00:18:03,575
I should have been asked first!
我应该先问问的!

206
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:06,021
Where is the third Dalek?
第三个 Dalek 哪里去了?

207
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:07,576
I don't know what you're talking about!
我不知道你在说什么!

208
00:18:07,828 --> 00:18:13,254
You opened up the capsule without permission.
You found the inner compartment containing three Daleks
你没经过允许就打开了舱体. 你发现了隔间里有三个 Daleks

209
00:18:13,428 --> 00:18:15,254
You took one of them away and you hid it!
你弄走了一个，藏了起来!

210
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:18,197
Hid it? What... what nonsense!
藏起来? 简直... 胡说八道!

211
00:18:18,427 --> 00:18:20,009
May I ask what all this is about?
我能问问这是怎么回事吗?

212
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:25,413
We opened an inner compartment in the capsule,
and Lesterson had already been in there.
我们打开舱体里面的隔间时，Lesterson 早就进去过了.

213
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:26,888
I don't deny that.
我不否认这个.

214
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:28,133
And he's nicked a Dalek!
他藏匿了一个 Dalek!

215
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:29,171
Dalek?

216
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:33,549
It's the name the Examiner has given to two metal creations
that I've discovered inside the capsule.
这是监察员给这种金属生物起的名字，就我在舱体里面发现的那两个生物.

217
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:34,970
And they're dangerous. Evil.
他们很危险，很邪恶.

218
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:37,620
Lumps of metal! Quite inactive.
金属肿块而已! 非常不活跃.

219
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:40,522
That's what you think, mate. If you'd seen...
那是你的想法，伙计．如果你看过...

220
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:47,067
I consider it's my duty as a scientist to... to examine and investigate these objects.
我想这是我作为一个科学家的指责，检查和调查这些东西

221
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,567
Now please, all of you, keep out of my laboratory.
Keep your hands off my experiments!
现在请离开我的实验室，你们全部．别想染指我的实验!

222
00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:58,145
Those 'lumps of metal' - Daleks - 
I want them broken up, or melted down. 
Up, or down, I don't care which, but destroyed!
那些＂金属肿块＂ - Daleks - 我期望他们坏掉，溶掉．我不关心什么方法，但要毁掉．

223
00:18:58,318 --> 00:18:59,517
I refuse to allow it.
我不允许

224
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:04,996
I'm an Earth Examiner - I demand it.
我是地球监察员 - 我要求这样.

225
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:06,606
You're exceeding your authority.
这已经超过你的授权范围了.

226
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:10,405
Perhaps we should ask the Governor about that?
I wish to see him immediately!
或许我们该问问总督的意见?我要马上见他!

227
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,669
That might be difficult.
那可能比较困难.

228
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,554
But not impossible. Ben, Polly.
但不是不可能. Ben, Polly.

229
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:21,703
Could he stop the experiments?
他能够停掉这些实验不?

230
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:26,912
I don't know. It's none of your business.
You go and get Janley and then come back here.
我不知道. 这不关你们的事. 你去叫一下 Janley，然后一起过来

231
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,912
We haven't... haven't got any time to waste.
Now go on man, quickly, quickly!
我们没有... 没有时间浪费. 去吧，快，快!

232
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:58,841
I'd advise a little discretion in your investigations.
It's not a very good time, just now.
但我建议你调查的时候慎重一下. 现在不是一个好的时间点.

233
00:19:59,382 --> 00:20:00,463
With all these disturbances...
当前这些风风雨雨...

234
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:01,430
Disturbances?
风风雨雨?

235
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:08,835
Yes, minor acts of sabotage, rebel cliques, secret newspapers,
nothing important you understand, but it keeps the Governor busy.
是的, 一些小的破坏活动, 结党叛乱, 秘密报纸, 没什么太重要的. 但也让总督闲不下来

236
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:12,735
I have no doubt he'll tell you about it himself
when I arrange your meeting with him.
我毫不怀疑他会自己跟你说的, 我安排一下你们的会见．

237
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:13,913
When will that be?
打算在什么时候?

238
00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:20,051
Ah, he's going on a tour of the perimeter of the colony.
I'll... I'll find out if he can see you before he goes.
啊, 他先要对基地周边巡视一下... 我看看他去之前能不能见你一下.

239
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,421
Thank you.
谢谢你.

240
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:38,982
Ah, it's a...
啊, 这是个...

241
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:53,182
He won't stop me experimenting. There must be some way to bring you back to life - and I'm going to find it.
他可阻止不了我的实验．一定有什么方法让你活过来 - 我要找出来

242
00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:55,405
Here, I bet old Charlie Bragen did it!
我打赌是那个老Charlie Bragen 干的!

243
00:20:55,681 --> 00:20:56,233
Charlie?
是叫 Charlie 吗?

244
00:20:56,444 --> 00:20:57,848
Well Fred wouldn't suit him would it?
但是 Fred 这个名字不太适合他啊，是吧?

245
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,829
If he did do it, do you think it was his own idea?
I mean - he could have been under orders.
如果是他做的，你觉得那是他自己的想法吗? 我是说 - 他可能是收到了命令

246
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:05,154
You mean from the Governor? Ah, I don't know.
What do you think, Doctor?
你说可能来自总督? 啊, 我不知道. 你怎么想，博士?

247
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:09,801
Oh, yes. Yes of course. Let's... let's consider this button for a moment.
哦，是的. 当然. 我们... 我们先来看一下这个纽扣.

248
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:15,401
It's the only clue we've got to the murderer of the Examiner.
The real Examiner.
这是我们手上关于监察员被害的唯一线索，那个真监察员.

249
00:21:15,736 --> 00:21:18,201
Hmm. And who asked for him to come?
唔. 谁要求他来这里的?

250
00:21:18,465 --> 00:21:21,818
Hmm. Well, Lesterson's crackers about that capsule.
He wouldn't want anyone nosing about.
唔，看Lesterson对于那个舱体的疯狂举动，他不想让任何人打听.

251
00:21:21,874 --> 00:21:23,802
Bragen said the Governor's been having trouble.
Bragen 说总督那边一直麻烦缠身.

252
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:26,744
Naw, rule him out. Governors are all the same, he wouldn't ask for help.
好，先排除他. 总督都是一样的，他不会请求援助.

253
00:21:26,848 --> 00:21:29,444
If he sent the word it would look as if he couldn't do the job properly.
如果他发这样的信息，会让他看起来不能正确自己处理.

254
00:21:29,463 --> 00:21:30,154
Yes.
是的

255
00:21:32,344 --> 00:21:35,322
Oh, well, I vote we go back to the TARDIS,
I've had enough of this dump.
哦噢，我建议先回到 TARDIS, 我有点受够了.

256
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,009
Have you? What about the Daleks?
是吗? Daleks 怎么办?

257
00:21:38,282 --> 00:21:39,372
Well, they're dead.
他们是死的.

258
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:42,896
Well, what about that thing we saw in the capsule
- that was alive all right.
我们在舱体里面看到的那个东西是怎么一回事 - 那可是活的.

259
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:44,680
Well, can't explain that.
没法解释那个.

260
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:49,495
I can. And that's why we have to stay!
我能. 而且那就是为什么我们还不能走!

261
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:56,174
Ugly-looking brutes aren't they?
Hey, what's he want to muck about with them for?
他们很丑陋的畜生是吧? 嘿, 他到底瞎倒腾这些干什么呢?

262
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:58,174
Leave well alone, that's what I say.
别管这个了, 要我说.

263
00:21:58,386 --> 00:22:04,107
You're a fine one to be a research assistant. Leave well alone?
There'll be no progress on this planet with people like you around.
你就适合做个助手．别管这个了? 如果这个星球上都是你这样的人, 我们不会有任何进展.

264
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:08,042
We're doing all right as we are. Or we were until your lot
came along stirring things up
我们一直干得不错，或者说曾经不错，直到你们这些家伙出来把事情搅乱. 你们跑不掉, 你知道吧

265
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:14,542
You won't get away with it, you know.
The Governor knows all about you rebels.
He'll smash the lot of you when he's ready.
你们跑不掉的，你知道吧?总督对于你们叛乱的事情全知道, 当他准备好之后会碾碎你们.

266
00:22:14,607 --> 00:22:15,298
Governor?
总督?

267
00:22:15,364 --> 00:22:16,002
Yeah, the Governor!
对, 总督!

268
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:16,871
He couldn't smash...
他不可能碾碎...

269
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:24,054
Will you be quiet! Where do you both think you are?
This is a scientific laboratory. Kindly keep your politics out of it.
能不能安静一下! 你们俩以为自己是谁? 这是间科学实验室，请别把政治带进来.

270
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:29,654
Come on, Resno. Man, get on with it. We haven't got all day.
快点, Resno. 伙计, 动起来. 我们没有那么多时间.

271
00:22:29,794 --> 00:22:35,754
We've got to get this working before the Examiner stops us.
He's got some phobia about these...
我们得在监察员叫停之前搞定这个. 他有点害怕这些个...

272
00:22:35,806 --> 00:22:40,843
Daleks! I know the misery they cause - the destruction. 
Daleks! 我可知道他们能导致什么悲剧 - 完全的毁灭

273
00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:46,712
Well? Where is the Governor? What did he say?
总督在哪儿? 他说了什么?
哦?

274
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:51,848
He sends his apologies Examiner. He can't see you tonight,
but he hopes to see you first thing in the morning.
他传达了歉意, 监察员．他今晚不能见你, 但期望明早第一个见你.

275
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:55,374
Well, it might not wait that long, Char... ah, Bragen.
哦, 但也许不用等那么久, Charl ... 哦, Bragen.

276
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:56,709
It will have to.
还真早不了.

277
00:22:57,025 --> 00:22:57,892
Excuse me.
抱歉.

278
00:22:57,992 --> 00:22:58,615
Where are you going?
你要去哪儿?

279
00:22:58,908 --> 00:22:59,981
To see the Governor, of course.
当然是去见总督.

280
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:06,298
I'm afraid that's not possible. Once his door is closed, no-one,
not even you, Examiner, is allowed into his room!
恐怕不可能．一旦他的门关上了, 没有人, 即便是你监察员, 也不允许进入他的房间!

281
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:10,898
Very well.
好吧.

282
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,963
Thank you. Until the morning then.
谢谢. 那就明早吧.

283
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:18,146
What happens now?
这里发生了什么?

284
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:23,953
I shall radio Earth. I'll get Earth to back me.
我要联系地球，得让地球支持我

285
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:26,527
Connecting now.
开始连接.

286
00:23:29,796 --> 00:23:31,023
All connections responding.
所有连接正常.

287
00:23:32,322 --> 00:23:33,241
Nothing at all?
完全没反应?

288
00:23:33,483 --> 00:23:34,207
No.

289
00:23:38,173 --> 00:23:39,195
It's moving!
开始动了!

290
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:49,572
Now, note this, Janley. Number one attachment with sucker
stick responding. Number two attachment not moving.
现在记下来, Janley. 一号附着物吸盘有反应. 二号附着物没动.

291
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:56,572
Number three attachment with lens responding.
Watch these meters, Resno.
三号附着物镜头有反应. 看看这些读数, Resno.

292
00:23:56,825 --> 00:23:57,641
Still responding.
还有反应.

293
00:23:57,914 --> 00:24:03,600
Now, it's reasonable to assume that this the sucker stick
acts like some kind of a hand.
现在, 有理由假定这个有吸盘的棍子有着手一样的功能.

294
00:24:03,836 --> 00:24:08,997
It's all right - don't be alarmed.
We've only introduced temporary power.
没事 - 别大惊小怪. 我们只给了临时的能量.

295
00:24:09,136 --> 00:24:13,997
We shall have to be able to open it up
before we could find how it works permanently.
我们得打开它才能彻底搞明白它是怎么工作的.

296
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:15,546
It's a bit frightening.
这东西有一点吓人.

297
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:21,656
Yes. Now, I cannot think what this short stubby arm is for.
是的. 现在我没法想出这个短臂是干什么的.

298
00:24:21,957 --> 00:24:23,621
Could the lens attachment be an eye?
这些镜头会是眼睛吗?

299
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:34,207
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now it's quite possible that this, ah, Dalek...
Now there must be some kind of directing influence.
是的, 是的. 很有可能是． 啊, 这个叫做Dalek的东西... 肯定有某种指挥系统

300
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:42,207
There may even be a simplified brain. Positronic,
I shouldn't wonder. If only we could open it up!
这里甚至可能有一个简化的大脑. 正电子的, 我不会奇怪的. 要是我们能打开它就好了!

301
00:24:44,938 --> 00:24:45,788
Now what?
现在怎么办?

302
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,344
Everything functioning here.
所有都可以工作了.

303
00:24:47,615 --> 00:24:51,735
Yes. Well, perhaps the power is leaking away somewhere.
We'll... we'll try again.
是的, 也许某个地方有能量泄露. 我们再试试.

304
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,128
Look at the eye-stick!
看它的眼睛!

305
00:25:18,506 --> 00:25:19,337
It's watching us!
它在看我们!

306
00:25:19,714 --> 00:25:20,602
Don't be absurd.
荒谬.

307
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:21,743
It was. I saw it!
真的. 我看见了!

308
00:25:21,984 --> 00:25:28,221
You can't use the phrase 'watching us'. You'll have us
believing that th... the thing has intelligence next.
你不能说＂在看我们＂. 你这样会让我们觉得... 这东西好像有智力似的.

309
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:30,021
Now, get on with your work, man!
继续干活去吧!

310
00:26:00,823 --> 00:26:01,509
I know you're there.
我就知道你在这里.

311
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:06,709
Examiner, thank goodness, it's you.
I've been trying to talk to you ever since you got here.
监察员, 谢天谢地, 是你啊. 你一到这里我就想来跟你谈谈.

312
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:10,408
What's happening here? You again.
这里发生了什么? 又是你.

313
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:11,650
What do you want?
你想要什么?

314
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:13,622
I found the operator unconscious.
我发现这个操作员昏迷了.

315
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:18,923
So did I! I was just looking at him, when I heard
someone move. It must have been you.
我也发现了! 我正看着他, 就听见有谁在走动了. 肯定是你.

316
00:26:19,697 --> 00:26:20,638
And those?
那些是...?

317
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:24,222
I picked them up. What is all this?
我刚捡起来的. 这都是怎么了?

318
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:25,935
The cables have been cut.
这些线缆被剪断了.

319
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:32,175
This is serious. It's not just our own communications.
We're cut off from Earth as well.
这很严重. 不仅仅是内部通讯出了问题了，我们跟地球的联系也被切断了.

320
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:33,909
The only people who'd want to do that are the rebels.
想干这个的只能是那些叛乱分子.

321
00:26:34,164 --> 00:26:36,896
Those muscle boys of yours had any brains,
they'd stop things like this.
你的那些四肢发达的小伙子要是有点脑子的话, 就能防止这些事情发生了.

322
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:41,981
And you say you picked these up? I suggest that
you were sabotaging the communications...
你说这个东西是你捡到的? 我觉得破坏通讯的也是你...

323
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:42,796
That's a lie!
那是瞎说!

324
00:26:43,027 --> 00:26:46,433
...having first attacked one of the engineers.
I'd detain the Governor on evidence like that.
...还攻击了其中一个工程师. 有这些证据，我得让总督过一会儿再走.

325
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:48,952
I hope you're not thinking of detaining me, Bragen.
我期望你没打算监禁我, Bragen.

326
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:52,790
I've no option. I could hardly let you run around loose after this, could I?
我没得选. 发生了这样的事, 我不可能再让你乱跑, 是吧?

327
00:26:53,324 --> 00:26:57,081
All right - you win this round, Bragen.
We'll see what it looks like in front of the Governor.
好吧 - 这轮你赢了. 我们看看到了总督面前怎么说.

328
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,197
All connections responding.
所有连接正常.

329
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,060
Excellent.
很好.

330
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:02,039
It's working!
行了!

331
00:27:02,257 --> 00:27:08,247
Excellent. Film it, film it now, Resno.
And, note the readings, Janley.
很好. 录下来, 现在就录, Resno. 对了, 记一下数据, Janley.

332
00:27:11,892 --> 00:27:13,560
It seems to be interested in you, Resno.
看来它对你有兴趣, Resno.

333
00:27:15,238 --> 00:27:16,545
What's the matter with you man?
你是怎么回事?

334
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:21,555
I tell you it's intelligent. It's watching me, Lesterson.
Weighing me up! I can sense it!
我告诉你它是有智能的. 他在看着我, Lesterson. 在打量我! 我能感觉到!

335
00:27:21,825 --> 00:27:22,700
Don't be a fool.
别傻了.

336
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,874
I don't like it I tell you.
I don't know what these things can do.
我不喜欢这样, 我跟你说．我不知道这些东西能做出什么事情来．

337
00:27:25,075 --> 00:27:30,866
No, and we never shall know, shall we, unless we take film
of every reaction. Now get on with your work, man!
不, 我们永远不可能知道, 除非我们把它的每一个反应都拍下来. 继续你的工作, 伙计!

338
00:27:40,757 --> 00:27:41,453
Resno!

339
00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:49,164
It's all right. He isn't dead.
没事．他没死.

340
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,225
What happened?
发生了什么?

341
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:51,816
Knocked out by the shock waves.
被冲击波震晕了.

342
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:56,678
We must get him to the hospital. I'll go and get help.
我们必须带他去医院, 我去叫人来帮忙.

343
00:28:20,505 --> 00:28:22,489
But we've got to defend Quinn.
我们要帮 Quinn 作证

344
00:28:22,882 --> 00:28:25,701
Yeah, I know. He's innocent until he's proved guilty. But he is guilty.
是的,  我知道． 他是无辜的,  至少在证明他有罪之前．但他有罪.

345
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:27,306
He's the Deputy Governor!
他是副总督!

346
00:28:27,553 --> 00:28:34,278
So what? I had a headmaster once who got nicked for not paying his bus fare!
And then there's the motive, don't forget the motive.
那又怎样? 我那会儿有个小头目被撸下来, 就只因为没交公交车费! 而且他这还是有动机的, 别忘了动机.

347
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:35,646
Like what for instance?
比如说是什么?

348
00:28:35,891 --> 00:28:39,465
Well, he's the Deputy Governor, right? Maybe he wants to be Governor.
首先, 他是副总督, 对吧? 也许他想当总督.

349
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:41,117
Oh, that's ridiculous!
哦, 这太荒谬了!

350
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,674
Well, the jacket button wasn't! And he was caught red-handed
in the Communications Room with a pair of pliers
那, 外衣纽扣总不荒谬吧! 而且他在通讯室里面被抓住时手里正拿着一把钳子

351
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,674
And don't tell me he was plucking his eye-brows either.
别跟我说他是拿那东西来剪眉毛的.

352
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,467
Look, there are some people you know are all right.
You just know by looking at them.
有些人你知道他们是没有问题的，你看见他们的样子就知道.

353
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,841
Good morning. The enquiry is about to begin.
I've been sent to escort you.
早上好. 质询马上要开始. 我被派来带你们过去.

354
00:28:57,895 --> 00:29:05,351
I am sorry I couldn't see you earlier, Examiner. Please sit down.
我很抱歉没能早点见你，监察员. 请坐. 

355
00:29:05,895 --> 00:29:14,351
Well, Quinn, I don't like this anymore than you do.
What have you been up to?
Quinn, 我跟你一样不喜欢这个. 你都做什么了?

356
00:29:14,743 --> 00:29:16,336
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
什么也没有做.

357
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:20,520
Well, what about Bragen's report then? These are facts, Quinn.
Now, what have you got to say about it?
那， Bragen 的报告是怎么回事? 这些是事实证据, Quinn. 现在，你还有什么要说的?

358
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,717
Does the engineer say I hit him?
那个工程师说是我打了他?

359
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:24,267
How could he if he was hit from behind?
他是被人从后面袭击的，他能怎么说?

360
00:29:24,476 --> 00:29:25,633
Then its only circumstantial evidence.
那就只有间接证据了.

361
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:31,589
The Examiner was also attacked in the mercury swamp.
We have a button from your jacket, found in the Examiner's hand.
监察员也在水银沼泽被人袭击了. 这里有一颗你衣服上的纽扣，是在监察员手里找到的.

362
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:33,787
I can't explain that.
这个我没法解释.

363
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,048
I'm sure you can't!
我肯定你没法!

364
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:41,536
Examiner. You mentioned to Bragen that these machines of Lesterson's... What do you call them?
监察员，你向 Bragen 提及了 Lesterson 发现的那些机器... 你管他们叫什么来着?

365
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:43,598
I call them what they are - Daleks.
他们本来的名字 - Daleks

366
00:29:43,846 --> 00:29:48,347
Ah, yes, yes, yes, Daleks. You say they could be a motive
for destroying our communications.
啊, 是是是, Daleks. 你说他们可能有动机破坏我们的通讯设施.

367
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,409
I do.
我说过.

368
00:29:49,773 --> 00:29:52,025
Lesterson, this is a special enquiry. Now please.
Lesterson, 这是一场特别的质询. 请你...

369
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:54,039
This won't wait. You won't be disappointed!
等不急了. 你不会失望的!

370
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:55,080
You heard what I said Lesterson!
你听到我说什么了 Lesterson!

371
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:59,832
Governor, I've just completed a... an experiment which could revolutionise the whole colony. Bear with me.
总督，我已经完成了一项实验，可给基地带来革命. 听我多说两句.

372
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,229
Lesterson, what have you done? What have you done?
Lesterson, 你完成什么了? 你完成什么了?

373
00:30:02,488 --> 00:30:05,884
I'll show you. Janley, now!
我给你演示一下. Janley, 开始!

374
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:44,400
It recognised the Doctor. It recognised him.
它认出了博士. 它认得他.

375
00:30:44,535 --> 00:30:46,642
What's the matter, Doctor? Are you all right?
你怎么啦，博士? 有什么不舒服吗?

376
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,182
The fools. The stupid fools.
蠢人. 愚蠢之极.

377
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:53,202
You're scared! What can it do?
你害怕啦! 它能干什么?

378
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:54,831
Nothing yet.
目前还没有.

379
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:58,614
It knew who you were! It sounds ridiculous, but it did.
它知道你是谁! 虽然听起来很疯狂，但是真的.

380
00:30:55,543 --> 00:30:57,587
<i>(This creation is called, I understand, a Dalek... )</i>
<i>(这个生物叫做, 按我的理解, 叫做 Dalek...)</i>

381
00:30:58,143 --> 00:31:01,187
<i>(Lesterson: Now, look at it. I have merely given it electrical power.
But it is capable of storing it..)</i>
<i>(现在看着, 我只不过给了一点电力, 但它能够储存它..)</i>

382
00:30:58,874 --> 00:30:59,715
Knew who I was.
知道我过去是谁.

383
00:31:01,045 --> 00:31:02,382
The Dalek knows who you are.
Dalek 知道你现在是谁.

384
00:31:04,223 --> 00:31:09,257
Moreover, it responds to orders. Turn around.
它还能对命令做出响应. 转一圈

385
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Move that chair. Stop.
移动那个椅子. 停下

386
00:31:25,905 --> 00:31:32,480
You see? Well, just think what this could do for our...
our mining program, our processing, packaging.
看见了吧. 想想这能给我们的挖矿, 流水线, 打包工作带来什么.

387
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:37,280
Dozens of labour jobs, Governor.
It may even supply the end to all this Colony's problems.
无数的劳工啊, 总督. 它甚至可以终结这个基地的所有问题.

388
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:42,750
Yes, it will end the colony's problems, because it will end the colony!
是的, 它可以终结这个基地的所有问题, 因为它可以终结这个基地!

389
00:31:42,814 --> 00:31:47,649
I am your servant.
我-是-你的-仆人.

390
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:55,144
It... it spoke! Janley, did you hear it? It can actually talk!
它... 它说话了! Janley, 你听到了吗? 它真的会说话!

391
00:31:55,182 --> 00:32:01,888
It can do many things, Lesterson.
But the thing it does most efficiently is exterminate human beings.
它能做很多事情, Lesterson. 但它干得最有效率的事情是终结人的生命.

392
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:12,288
It destroys them, without mercy, without conscience.
It destroys them. Utterly. Completely. It destroys them.
它毁灭人类, 毫不留情, 毫无内疚. 它毁灭人类. 绝对地. 完全地. 毁灭人类.

393
00:32:13,086 --> 00:32:17,181
I am your servant. I am your servant....
我-是-你的-仆人. 我-是-你的-仆人

394
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:20,718
So Lesterson, they're even capable of speech!
Lesterson, 它们居然可以说话!

395
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,870
Yes. But then, why not? After all, they have a certain intelligence.
是的. 为什么不呢? 毕竟, 他们有一定的智力.

396
00:32:27,087 --> 00:32:27,935
Yes I know, but...
是的我知道, 但是...

397
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,741
But is... is it... it is... an intelligence that we can control.
但是, 是不是... 我们可以控制住.

398
00:32:32,132 --> 00:32:35,122
So what you want is permission to continue your experiments?
你想的无非就是获准可以继续你的实验?

399
00:32:35,357 --> 00:32:40,100
Just think what it would mean if we were to set it to work in the mines. It could double our production overnight!
只要想想这意味着什么, 我们可以让他们去挖矿. 明天我们的生产力可以翻番了!

400
00:32:40,312 --> 00:32:42,295
Consider the effects it could have on our whole economy.
想想这可能给我们整体经济带来什么效果.

401
00:32:42,576 --> 00:32:49,657
Yes, and the effect of that on Earth... Yes. Yes, they could be very grateful.
是的, 还可以地球地球带来... 是的, 是的, 他们会很感激的.

402
00:32:49,981 --> 00:32:53,478
I shall stop you. I will!
我会阻止你的，我会的!

403
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,105
All right Lesterson, permission granted.
好了 Lesterson, 我允许了

404
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:58,455
Permission? Permission for what?
允许? 允许什么?

405
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:01,061
To continue my work, Examiner.
继续我的工作啊, 监察员.

406
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:05,103
But... But didn't you all hear what I said? The Daleks must be destroyed!
但是... 但是你没听见我说什么了吗? Daleks必须全部毁掉!

407
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,395
Never!
绝不!

408
00:33:06,713 --> 00:33:11,897
Very well. If not by my order - then by Earth's! Come Ben, Polly.
很好. 如果我的命令不好使 - 那地球的命令总可以了! 过来 Ben, Polly.

409
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,783
You're my servant, are you?
你是我的仆人, 是吗?

410
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:18,186
I... I am.
我... 是.

411
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:32,370
Very well. Immobilise yourself. Go on. I order it! Immediately!
很好. 关掉你自己. 快. 我命令! 马上!

412
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:38,620
Huh!
哈!

413
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,827
Lesterson.

414
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,626
Why did you stop obeying? You were given an order.
你为什么不遵守? 你已经收到命令了.

415
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:49,850
He has gone.
他-已经-走了.

416
00:33:50,431 --> 00:33:51,698
Then you obey only...
你只遵守...

417
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:59,356
His order was wrong. I cannot serve human beings if I am immobilised.
他的-命令-是-错误的. 我-要是-关掉-自己-就-不能-服务于-人了/00

418
00:33:59,897 --> 00:34:06,156
You gave me power. Your orders are right. I serve you.
你-给了-我-能量. 你的-命令-是-对的. 我-服务于-你.

419
00:34:06,282 --> 00:34:10,609
Lesterson. Lesterson, it reasons. Just how limited is its intelligence?
Lesterson. Lesterson, 他会分析. 你不是说它智力有限吗?

420
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:16,794
Now, there is no cause for... for concern, Governor.
Just you wait until you see the amount of work it can do!
喔, 没理由担心这个, 总督. 你等着瞧它能做多少事情!

418
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:21,79
And now, I'm really going to put you through your paces. Follow me, Dalek.
现在, 我要让你经历你自己的生活了. 跟我来, Dalek.

421
00:34:22,244 --> 00:34:24,055
I obey.
我-服从.

422
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,858
Excellent. excellent.
非常好. 非常好.

423
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,967
But I thought we were after the Daleks, not this control unit you've nicked!
我还以为我们在追查的是 Daleks, 而不是你在玩弄的这个控制盒!

424
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:43,078
Ah, yes!

425
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:48,327
He's a right little delinquent, isn't he?
他对这事不怎么上心, 是不?

426
00:34:48,612 --> 00:34:50,857
Doctor, what on Earth are you up to?
博士, 你到底在干什么?

427
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:52,623
Ooh!
哦!

428
00:34:53,242 --> 00:34:56,126
Ah! Now we're really getting somewhere!
啊! 我们真有点进展了!

429
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:01,109
Now, the Examiner was attacked, there can be no question of that.
监察员被攻击了，这是毫无疑问的

430
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,116
And the button grabbed by the Examiner was missing from your suit.
被监察员抓到手的纽扣，也是你衣服上不见的那个.

431
00:35:04,411 --> 00:35:06,798
Yes, if you've got anything to add to that, you'd better say it now.
是的, 如果你还有什么补充, 你最好现在就说.

432
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:11,291
I didn't attack the man. I had no reason to. I was the one that sent for him!
我没有袭击他. 我没有理由. 他是我请求派来的!

433
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:14,121
You sent for him?!
你请求的?!

434
00:35:14,507 --> 00:35:19,416
It was necessary. Under the circumstances, I'd hardly be likely to sabotage the radio communications.
这是有必要的. 鉴于这个情况, 我也不可能破坏电波通讯.

435
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:21,940
But... but why Quinn? Why?
不过... 为什么 Quinn? 为什么?

436
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:23,425
Because of the rebels!
因为那些叛乱分子!

437
00:35:23,693 --> 00:35:26,152
The rebels! They're nothing more than one or two fanatics.
叛乱分子! 只不过有一两个狂热分子.

438
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:27,356
You know as well as I do that they...
你我都知道他们...

439
00:35:27,614 --> 00:35:31,572
Unless you're trying to create trouble here - to undermine the Governor's position.
除非你是想制造些事端 - 想挖总督的墙脚吧.

440
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:35,166
Bragen, you'd better explain that.
Bragen, 你最好解释一下.

441
00:35:35,494 --> 00:35:38,580
If you're removed, who takes your place? The Deputy Governor, of course.
如果你被除掉了, 谁顶你的位子? 当然是副总督

442
00:35:38,694 --> 00:35:42,580
And that's the real reason behind all this trouble, isn't it Quinn?
这就是所有问题的真正原因, 对吧 Quinn?

443
00:35:42,855 --> 00:35:43,426
Go on.
继续

444
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:46,513
You attack the Examiner in the mercury swamp and blame it on the rebels.
你在水银沼泽袭击了监察员, 嫁祸于叛乱分子

445
00:35:46,649 --> 00:35:49,213
Then you sabotage the radio - blame that on the rebels too.
然后又破坏了电台 - 也归咎于叛乱分子.

446
00:35:50,342 --> 00:35:51,752
Get him out of my sight!
把他带走!

447
00:35:52,077 --> 00:35:54,864
Hensell, before you listen to these preposterous allegations...
Hensell, 在你听取这些荒谬的指控之前...

448
00:36:01,338 --> 00:36:08,367
I chose Quinn myself. I trained him for the job. Why, in a few years time, he'd have had this seat!
Quinn 是我自己选的. 我培养他干这个工作. 为什么啊, 要不了几年时间, 他就能坐在这个位子上了啊!

449
00:36:08,695 --> 00:36:11,727
Sometimes Governor, a few years is a long time to wait.
总督, 有时候, 几年时间也嫌太长, 等不了啊.

450
00:36:15,878 --> 00:36:16,797
Oh, Bragen?
哦, Bragen?

451
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:17,931
Governor?

452
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:25,573
You will assume Quinn's duties. As of now, you are Deputy Governor.
你接替 Quinn 的工作. 从现在开始, 你是副总督.

453
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,181
Look Doctor, I don't want to appear dim, but how's this going to do the Daleks in?
看着, 博士, 我并不想看起来比较负能量, 但这跟 Daleks 有什么关系?

454
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:39,197
They think that Lesterson's the driving force, but I don't. The Daleks are using him.
他们认为是 Lesterson 有主导权, 但我觉得不是. Daleks 在利用他.

455
00:36:39,557 --> 00:36:40,431
But how?
那怎么办?

456
00:36:40,672 --> 00:36:46,513
Problem. Smash the Daleks, and the people here will lock us up or kill us.
有个问题. 砸碎 Daleks 的话, 这里的人会把我们锁起来或者干脆干掉我们

457
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:49,713
Let the Daleks go, and we'll all be exterminated.
任由 Daleks 乱来的话, 我们会被终结掉

458
00:36:50,677 --> 00:36:53,444
We could just go back to the TARDIS. At least we'd be safe to think there.
我们可以回 TARDIS 去. 至少在那里是安全的.

459
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:55,389
Oh yes, that's coming on.
哦, 是的, 形势逼人啊

460
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,356
Oh, you talk to him, will you?
哦, 你会跟他说的, 是吗?

461
00:36:57,594 --> 00:37:00,504
Doctor look, if you told us what you were up to, perhaps we could help you.
博士, 如果你告诉我们你要干什么的话, 也许我们能帮上忙.

462
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:06,849
Mustn't underestimate any of them.
Lesterson's a first class scientist, first class.
千万不能低估他们中的任何一个. Lesterson 是个一流的科学家, 一流的

463
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:12,849
He opened the capsule. He realised that the Daleks could be reactivated.
他打开了舱体, 还发现 Daleks 可以被重新激活.

464
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:17,347
Yeah, that could be the answer.
Let's kidnap Lesterson, and hide him away for a bit.
是, 那可能就是答案. 我们不如把 Lesterson 绑架了吧, 把他藏起来一阵子

465
00:37:17,566 --> 00:37:20,347
Well, it would stop him bringing the Daleks back to life, wouldn't it?
这样就可以阻止他救活那些 Daleks, 对吧?

466
00:37:21,496 --> 00:37:22,861
I thought it was pretty bright.
我觉得这个主意真不错.

467
00:37:23,186 --> 00:37:24,234
There we are.
这下可以了.

468
00:37:24,874 --> 00:37:25,891
What is it?
是什么?

469
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:33,771
What is it? It could be the answer to all our problems.
是什么? 可能是我们所有问题的答案.

470
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:38,422
Incredible! Well, let's move on to test fourteen.
难以置信! 好, 下面我们进行第14项测试.

471
00:37:38,785 --> 00:37:40,409
I am ready.
我-准备-好了.

472
00:37:41,771 --> 00:37:45,916
When sodium acts on ethyl alcohol, what is the resulting derivative?
把钠与酒精掺在一起, 会产生什么化合物?

473
00:37:46,426 --> 00:37:52,419
Sodium ethoxide. C2 H5 ONa.
乙醇钠，C2H5ONa

474
00:37:53,637 --> 00:37:57,266
Just five seconds, Janley! Just the time it took to speak the answer.
只需要5秒, Janley! 而且这点时间都用来念答案了.

475
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,294
Right too.
又答对了.

476
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:05,223
But of course it's right! Look, can you imagine
what kind of positronic brain this robot has, Janley?
当然是对的! 你能想象这个机器人用的是哪种正子脑吗, Janley?

477
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:08,223
Think of the store of knowledge that it must carry.
想想他得存有多少知识.

478
00:38:08,377 --> 00:38:09,095
May I come in?
我可以进来吗?

479
00:38:09,351 --> 00:38:10,283
What do you want?
你想干什么?

480
00:38:10,513 --> 00:38:12,851
Oh, ah, just to see how you're getting on.
哦, 只是来看看你这里进展如何.

481
00:38:13,193 --> 00:38:13,795
If you think...
如果你想要...

482
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:18,703
No, please! I'm... I'm not here to cause trouble.
I... I'm just interested, that's all.
不, 别这样! 我... 不是来找麻烦的. ... 我只是很有兴趣, 仅此而已.

483
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:21,662
You've done nothing but meddle and interfere
ever since you landed on Vulcan.
自你达到 Vulcan 以来, 除了干扰和干涉之外什么也没做过.

484
00:38:21,982 --> 00:38:28,007
Well, I... I did give you permission to open up the capsule,
now didn't I? Please, carry on.
这个... 是我给了权限打开舱体, 是吧? 请, 继续吧.

485
00:38:28,775 --> 00:38:30,577
And you won't try to stop me?
你不打算阻止我?

486
00:38:30,923 --> 00:38:35,999
Stop you? No, of course not. We get off on the wrong foot, Lesterson, but..
阻止你? 不, 当然不. 咱们俩一开始就不怎么对付, Lesterson, 不过...

487
00:38:36,123 --> 00:38:40,999
But I'm a reasonable man and... and I've been thinking, perhaps I was hasty.
不过我是一个讲理的人... 我在想, 也许是我太鲁莽了.

488
00:38:41,513 --> 00:38:44,417
Well, if you... if you... if you really want to call a truce.
好吧, 如果... 如果你真想要休战.

489
00:38:44,686 --> 00:38:47,924
A truce? My dear fellow, I... I'd like to be friends!
休战? 亲爱的家伙, ... 我期望可以成为朋友!

490
00:38:48,963 --> 00:38:52,669
Yes. Yes. Very well, you may stay.

Oh, thank you. Thank you.
噢，谢谢你，谢谢你

492

493
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,311
All right, I can come now. Right.
好的, 我可以过来. 好.

00:39:11,522 --> 00:39:14,955
I just have to slip out for a few minutes, Lesterson, alright?
我得出去几分钟, Lesterson, 可以吧?

495
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,501
Ah, yes, yes. Um, very well then. Examiner, shall we test its knowledge of physics?
啊, 可以, 可以. 唔, 那么, 监察员, 我们开始测试一下他的物理知识?

496
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,851
Oh, oh, splendid, splendid. Ah, huh, please, please, carry on.
哦, 太好了, 啊, 请开始吧.

497
00:39:23,132 --> 00:39:26,551
Thank you. D... what is the First Law of Thermodynamics?
谢谢你... 热力学第一定律是什么?

498
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:39,702
When heat is transformed into any other kind of energy or vice versa,
the total quantity of energy remains invariable. 
当-热能-转换成-其它-能, 或者-反过来, 能量-总和-保持-不变.

499
00:39:40,101 --> 00:39:51,402
That is to say, the quantity of heat which disappears is
equivalent to the quantity of other kind of energy produced...
也-就是-说, 消失的-热能-和-新产生的-其它-类型的-能-在量上-是-相同的...

500
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,370
Fool! What do you think you're doing? I'm saving your life. Get out, get out!
笨蛋! 你以为你在干什么? 我会救你的. 出去, 出去!

501
00:39:56,764 --> 00:40:04,191
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... I have, ah, sustained no damage.
啊!... 啊!... 啊!... 我-扛住-了, 啊, 没有-受损

502
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:13,575
You were able to get away then?
你甩开他们了?

503
00:40:14,218 --> 00:40:16,609
Yes. Lesterson's with the Examiner. And Hensell?
是的. Lesterson 和监察员在一起. Hensell 呢?

504
00:40:16,907 --> 00:40:19,691
At a meeting of production managers. He left me in control.
在和产品经理们开会. 现在我说了算.

505
00:40:20,805 --> 00:40:22,609
We could take over the colony now.
现在我们可以接管这个基地了.

506
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:29,404
No. No it has to be absolutely right. I don't want to take over
a colony full of rebels do I, Janley?
不. 必须做到万无一失. 我可不想接管一个满是叛乱分子的基地, 对吧, Janley?

507
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:32,072
Well, I don't know. You're making me help them.
我也不清楚. 是你让我帮助他们.

508
00:40:32,383 --> 00:40:37,126
Only to stir them up to create enough trouble to get rid of Hensell,
and then... and then we crush them.
把他们搅乱, 多制造些问题, 就可以把 Hensell 搞下去了. 然后我们再镇压他们.

509
00:40:37,383 --> 00:40:43,126
The whole colony will be grateful, and I'll be Governor.
整个基地都会感激我们, 我就是总督了.

510
00:40:45,616 --> 00:40:47,014
Is that the gun you told me of?
这就是你跟我说过的那种枪?

511
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:49,819
Can you persuade the rebels this will help them?
你能说服那些叛乱分子, 说这对他们很有用吗?

Yes, Valmar thinks he can work in a switch to turn it on and off.
是的, Valmar 认为他可以做一个开关.

513
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:54,412
How powerful is it?

514
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,161
It killed Resno, Lesterson's assistant
它杀死了 Resno, Lesterson 的助手

515
00:40:58,385 --> 00:41:01,561
And Lesterson believes that Resno's simply shaken up - taking a few days off.
Lesterson 还以为 Resno 只是晕倒了, 需要休息几天而已.

516
00:41:01,922 --> 00:41:02,747
And the body?
尸体呢?

517
00:41:03,235 --> 00:41:09,141
In the mercury swamp. Lesterson was the indirect cause of Resno's death.
扔进水银沼泽了. 其实是 Lesterson 害死了他.

518
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:14,241
It's a good hold over him if he makes trouble.
这是个不错的把柄, 不怕他制造麻烦了

519
00:41:14,335 --> 00:41:16,241
I'll give this to Valmar then?
那我把这个交给 Valmar 去了?

520
00:41:16,305 --> 00:41:16,878
Yes.

When do we move?

I thought Quinn was the danger.
我以为 Quinn 才是危险.

哦, 不再是了. 那个监察员不是傻子. 不对, 这里还得搞点事儿.

00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:37,625
Well?

526
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:40,222
Well, he's not in the laboratory, Lesterson's by himself.
他不在实验室里, 只有 Lesterson 一个人.

527
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,939
Hmm. He must have gone another way. Can I leave it you? I'm going to go back to the rest room.
嗯. 他肯定从别的路走了. 把你一个人留在这里行吗? 我打算回休息室去.

Well, do you know where he is?

还好. 我总算及时阻止了那个傻蛋监察员.

How accurate is it?
它有-多-准确?

00:44:08,097 --> 00:44:09,470
One hundred percent?
百分之百?

565
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:16,770
If you provide materials and our own power unit, a computer will be built.
如果-你能-提供-材料, 并给-我们-提供-能量, 计算机-将会-造好.

566
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:21,803

573
00:45:10,516 --> 00:45:12,056
Come on then!
快点啊!

00:45:12,657 --> 00:45:15,025
Now the energy intake for Daleks should be the cube...
Daleks 的能量入口应该是那个方块...

575
00:45:16,636 --> 00:45:17,528
Lesterson!

576
00:45:17,814 --> 00:45:18,175
Eh?

00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:21,554
He just went past. That means we can get into his laboratory again.

578
00:45:21,832 --> 00:45:22,618
But we're looking for...

Oh, come along, Ben. Come along.

Entry is restricted.
入口-是-受限的.

584
00:45:37,566 --> 00:45:40,745

对我不是. "授予一切权限". 我有这个徽章.

585
00:45:41,048 --> 00:45:42,256
That is an order.

Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Stand back!
啊!... 啊!!... 靠后站!

588
00:45:51,857 --> 00:45:55,775
Don't be frightened of it Ben. It's not armed.
I'm going to see what it was doing in there.
别怕它 Ben. 它没有武器了. 我倒要看看他打算在这里做什么.

589
00:46:05,712 --> 00:46:09,987
Ben, let's get out of here!
Ben, 我们快出去!

590
00:46:11,014 --> 00:46:12,977
Fool. Lesterson must have reactivated them.
蠢啊. Lesterson 一定重新激活他们了.

591
00:46:13,185 --> 00:46:17,141
Yes. When I say run, Run!
是的, 我说跑的时候 - 跑！

592
00:46:23,353 --> 00:46:29,761
I have sent the human being for materials.
我-已经-让人类-去-准备-材料了.

593
00:46:30,003 --> 00:46:31,116
And power?
还有-能量?

594
00:46:31,512 --> 00:46:39,209
Yes. Power we can turn into static, then we will conquer.
是. 我们-能把-能量-转换为-静电, 然后-我们-就可-征服.

595
00:46:39,533 --> 00:46:47,625
We will conquer... We will conquer... We will conquer...
我们-将要-征服... 我们-将要-征服... 我们-将要-征服...

596
00:46:47,859 --> 00:46:52,850
But if you didn't do it Lesterson, then the Dalek must have
used your power supply and reactivated the others itself.
但是如果不是你干的 Lesterson, 那么 Dalek 肯定是自己用你提供的电源激活了其它几个

597
00:46:53,065 --> 00:46:54,771
I was going to do that anyway.
我正要去激活它们呢.

598
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,286
Are you off your head, mate? Those two are armed!
你脑子秀逗了, 伙计? 他们是带武器的!

599
00:46:57,771 --> 00:47:02,156
Then we turn off the electricity, disarm them, and then everything is safe again.
那我们关掉电力供应, 解除他们的武装, 不就万事大吉了.

600
00:47:02,428 --> 00:47:03,606
I've already explained to you.

Stop these arguments, both of you. I've had enough.
停止这些争论吧, 你俩都别说了, 我受够了.

602
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:11,292
I've every confidence in Lesterson.
He has carte blanche for the Daleks from now on.
我对 Lesterson 有绝对信心. 从现在开始他将获得全权委托.

603
00:47:11,486 --> 00:47:13,183
But they must be destroyed!
但他们必须被销毁掉!

604
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:16,916
Bragen, I'm making a tour of the perimeter.
I put you in direct charge here.
Bragen, 我要下去巡视了, 在此期间这里你说了算

605
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:19,916
See that Lesterson gets everything he wants, will you?
确保 Lesterson 这里想要什么就给他什么, 好吧?

606
00:47:20,812 --> 00:47:25,104
I shall need a permanent guard on my laboratory, Bragen.
我实验室还需要一个保安, Bragen.

607
00:47:27,677 --> 00:47:31,887
Don't worry about the Examiner. I think I can keep him quiet.
别担心监察员. 我想我能让他保持安静.

608
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:36,416
Greed and ambition, that's all it is.
贪婪, 野心勃勃, 那就是它们的本性.

609
00:47:36,689 --> 00:47:40,816
Wait till they find out what their precious production figures have cost them!
等着吧, 看看他们美妙的产品图能带给他们什么代价!

610
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:42,245
Oh, I want to see you.
哦, 我正要去找你呢.

611
00:47:43,381 --> 00:47:44,340
What about?
为了什么?

612
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:46,607
Well it's Polly, she's missing. We can't find her anywhere.
是 Polly, 她失踪. 我们在哪儿都找不到她.

613
00:47:47,121 --> 00:47:50,570
I'll tell one of my men to make enquiries. It shouldn't take long to find her.
我安排一个人去找找, 应该很快就可以找到她.

614
00:47:50,906 --> 00:47:51,724
Ah, thanks.
多谢了.

615
00:47:52,674 --> 00:48:02,561
Examiner, some of my men have found a body in the mercury swamp.
It was the body of a middle-aged man.
监察员, 我的几个手下在水银沼泽里发现了一具尸体, 是一个中年人的.

616
00:48:03,174 --> 00:48:04,551
What is that to do with me?
这跟我有什么关系吗?

617
00:48:05,031 --> 00:48:08,277
You're the Examiner - or maybe you're not.
你是监察员啊 - 除非你不是.

618
00:48:14,543 --> 00:48:16,540
Just exactly what do you mean by that?
你这么说是什么意思?

619
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:20,187
Who are you? Quinn's friends? Come to stir up rebellion?
你是谁? Quinn 的朋友? 是来制造骚乱?

620
00:48:20,973 --> 00:48:24,431
There's only one possible way that you could know I'm not the Examiner.
如果你认为我不是监察员, 那只有一种可能.

621
00:48:24,931 --> 00:48:27,626
Yeah, by knowing what the real Examiner looked like!
是的, 那就是知道真正的监察员长什么样!

622
00:48:27,968 --> 00:48:36,494
Exactly, Ben. Exactly! Only two people knew of his arrival on this planet. Myself and his murderer.
很对, Ben. 很对! 只有两个人知道他抵达这个星球时的情形：我和杀他的人.

623
00:48:36,821 --> 00:48:37,824
That's enough!
够了!

624
00:48:38,117 --> 00:48:40,404
Is it? Doctor, we've got to tell the Governor.
是这样? 博士, 我们去告诉总督.

625
00:48:40,664 --> 00:48:47,099
Do you think he'll believe you? I'll soon convince him
that you murdered the man yourself. You stole the Examiner's badge.
你觉得他会相信你? 我很快就可以让他相信是你杀了那个人, 还偷了那个人的徽章.

626
00:48:48,207 --> 00:48:54,677
Then why don't you arrest us? Because there's a doubt isn't there?
Because it might, it just might, go against you.
那你为什么不逮捕我们? 因为这里还有疑问, 对不? 因为有可能不往你想的方向发展.

627
00:48:54,967 --> 00:49:02,753
All right, all right, so neither of us wants to make a move.
But you leave Lesterson alone - and the Daleks!
好吧, 好吧, 我们谁也不想先动. 但你们离 Lesterson 远点 - 还有 Daleks!

628
00:49:09,256 --> 00:49:11,456
He'd make a right Father Christmas, wouldn't he?
他要做一个圣诞老人, 对不

629
00:49:11,705 --> 00:49:15,502
Oh, I'd rather fight a hundred of his sort than just one Dalek.
哦, 我宁可跟一百个他这种人斗, 也不想碰到一个 Dalek.

630
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:30,142
Listen to this. "The girl is safe. She will remain so
as long as you leave the Daleks alone".
听听. "女孩儿很安全. 只要你们远离 Daleks, 她就是安全的".

631
00:49:34,561 --> 00:49:36,685
And did you disarm the other two?
你解除了另外两个的武器?

632
00:49:37,236 --> 00:49:43,136
Yes. We are your servants. We do not need guns.
是的-我们-是-你的-仆人-我们-不-需要-武器.

633
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:47,145
I'm very glad. I knew the Examiner was wrong about you.
我很高兴. 我知道监察员看错你们了.

634
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:49,535
Did you get our materials?
你-给-我们-带来-材料-了-吗?

635
00:49:49,831 --> 00:49:52,351
Yes. Everything you need you can have.
是的. 你们想要什么都行.

636
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,948
And a power plant?
还有-一个-电厂?

637
00:49:55,021 --> 00:49:56,107
Everything.
都行.

638
00:50:05,484 --> 00:50:08,822
We will get our power.
我们-将会-获得-能量(权力?)

639
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:18,523
We will get our power. We will get our power. We will...
我们-将会-获得-能量．我们-将会-获得-能量. 我们-将会...

640
00:50:27,043 --> 00:50:33,224
Turn back the power supply.
重新-打开-电力-供应

641
00:50:33,596 --> 00:50:38,124
I will, I will. But I want you to remember that I control you.
我会的，但我要你们记住，是我控制你们

642
00:50:38,622 --> 00:50:43,578
We are your servants.

643
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:48,946
I know. Remember it. I gave you each a special charge to bring you back to life.
我知道，记住这点：我给了你们每个充了电，这才让你们复活了

644
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:56,946
Any further power you need must come from this generator.
And I control it. Is that clear?
你们还需要电力的话，都得靠这个发电机来. 是我来控制它，清楚了吗?

645
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,759
We obey.
我们-服从

646
00:51:12,448 --> 00:51:13,759
Where are they going?
他们要去哪里?

647
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,170
To await your orders, master.
静候-你的-命令 主人

648
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:23,855
Good. Have you completed the blueprints for the meteor storm computer?

649
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,636
It is ready.
已经-好了

650
00:51:33,117 --> 00:51:44,235
Oh, it's marvellous! I'm glad we understand each other.
噢, 太棒了! 我很高兴我们达成了共识

651
00:51:44,324 --> 00:51:49,629
We understand the human mind.
我们-了解-人类-想法

652
00:51:52,564 --> 00:51:53,738
Isn't that finished yet?
还没完成吗?

653
00:51:54,126 --> 00:51:55,001
Nearly.
快了

654
00:51:55,122 --> 00:51:58,160
About time. This work should have been completed long before this.
还算及时. 这项工作早应该完成了

655
00:51:58,403 --> 00:51:59,522
Well, I did the best I could!
我已经尽了最大努力!

656
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:00,821
Well, it isn't good enough!
是，但还不够!

657
00:52:01,036 --> 00:52:02,804
Then get someone else, Bragen.
那你找其他人吧, Bragen.

658
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:07,322
Be careful! I shall be watching you, Valmar, after this - now get out!
小心点! 我会盯着你, Valmar, 从现在开始 - 现在给我出去!

659
00:52:11,317 --> 00:52:12,691
What does this intrusion mean?

I'm sorry, Bragen. I tried to stop them.
抱歉, Bragen. 我没能拦住他们

661
00:52:15,472 --> 00:52:19,497
Intrusion? It's no intrusion. We're just returning the various calls that you made.
硬闯进来? 不是硬闯. 你不是要见我们吗，我们就来了

662
00:52:19,672 --> 00:52:24,497
This guard tried to tell us you were busy. You're not a bit, are you?
这个保安跟我们说你一直都忙，但你一点也不忙，是不?

663
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:25,944
All right - I'll see them.
好了，我见他们

664

Oh, what a nice new uniform. Very smart, very smart. I would like a hat like that.
喔, 新制服很不错啊. 很醒目. 很醒目. 我想要一顶类似的帽子.

00:52:33,386 --> 00:52:34,421
Well, what do you want?
你们想要干什么

666
00:52:34,691 --> 00:52:37,084
Some joker has kidnapped Polly and sent us this note.
某些小丑绑架了 Polly ，送来了这张字条

667
00:52:37,364 --> 00:52:38,036
Yes.

668
00:52:38,332 --> 00:52:40,162
Well, we want to know what you're doing to find her.
我们想知道你打算怎样找她

669
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:43,245
Now that the communications are restored we can start a search.
现在通讯已经恢复了，我们可以展开搜索

670
00:52:43,582 --> 00:52:47,154
Yeah, I can just imagine what kind of job you'll make of that.
Haven't you heard anything yet?
好，我能想象你将会怎样做. 你没有听说什么吗?

671
00:52:47,368 --> 00:52:48,810
The planet is a large one.

672
00:52:53,464 --> 00:52:57,001
So! They've given you the run of the colony, have they?
他们已经让你来运作整个基地，是吧

673
00:52:57,483 --> 00:53:07,160
We obey. Do I bring liquid for your visitors?
我们-服从. 需要-给你的-客人-准备-饮料吗?

674
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:09,707
No. They won't be staying much longer.
不必了. 他们不会呆多久.

675
00:53:19,854 --> 00:53:22,560
Look, Doctor, if he's not going to help us, we'll have to search for Polly ourselves.
看, 博士, 如果他不打算帮我们, 我们就得自己去找寻 Polly 了.

676
00:53:22,886 --> 00:53:25,637
Sound advice. Why don't you, Doctor?
好主意, 为什么不去呢, 博士?

677
00:53:25,978 --> 00:53:28,772
Ah, ah, Examiner.
哦, 是监察员.

678
00:53:29,703 --> 00:53:33,453
I wonder how much longer they'll be able to move around on these floors?
我很好奇他们怎么能够在这些地板上转来转去?

679
00:53:33,728 --> 00:53:34,217
Eh?
呃?

680
00:53:34,307 --> 00:53:40,837
Static you see. They need a constant supply of static from the floor, some sort of electrical field.
静电你看. 他们需要地板持续提供静电, 某种电力场.

681
00:53:43,737 --> 00:53:46,831
Doctor. Why should he...?
博士, 为什么他会...?

682
00:54:03,912 --> 00:54:04,691
It's madness!
这太疯狂了!

683
00:54:05,056 --> 00:54:05,662
What is?
什么?

684
00:54:05,894 --> 00:54:08,761
Letting them run around like this.
允许他们像这样乱跑.

685
00:54:09,769 --> 00:54:13,993
Hey, wait a minute! Bragen had one acting as a servant, and we've just left him!
嘿, 等一下! Bragen 已经有一个做仆人的了, 我们刚离开那里!

686
00:54:14,675 --> 00:54:19,633
One Dalek in Bragen's office - three Daleks just gone down the corridors. That makes four!
一个 Dalek 在 Bragen 的办公室 - 三个 Daleks 刚走过了走廊. 总共就是四个!

687
00:54:20,526 --> 00:54:21,945
Where did the fourth one come from?
第四个哪里来的?

688
00:54:22,931 --> 00:54:29,635
Well, Lesterson can't have been making them.
Perhaps there were more in the capsule than we thought?
Lesterson 不可能在制造它们. 说不定舱体里面还有一些, 而我们不知道?

689
00:54:30,586 --> 00:54:31,198
Janley?

690
00:54:31,925 --> 00:54:32,537
What is it?
什么事?

691
00:54:32,746 --> 00:54:35,713
The Daleks. They've given me another list of materials they need.
那些 Daleks. 他们又给了一份清单, 说它们需要这些材料.

692
00:54:35,946 --> 00:54:38,939
Let me see. We've got all those things?
我看看. 我们有这些东西吗?

693
00:54:39,189 --> 00:54:43,517
Yes, but why these quantities, Janley? Why?
How can they have used up all the materials I gave them?
有, 不过为什么要这么多, Janley? 他们怎么可能已经用完我给他们的材料了?

694
00:54:43,889 --> 00:54:47,517
What is it? D... why, it's only a matter of a few hours ago.
到底是什么情况? ... 才过了几个小时而已.

695
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:49,180
They're building new things for us.
他们在为我们建设新东西.

696
00:54:49,374 --> 00:54:54,726
Yes, well I don't want them to do anything without consulting me.
What is it they do inside there?
是的, 我不想他们做事之前不问我的意见. 他们到底在那里面做什么?

697
00:54:54,969 --> 00:54:56,335
You're worrying too much.
你担心得过头了.

698
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:02,544
Look Janley, say what you like, but I'm beginning to believe
that the Examiner is right about the Daleks.
Janley 你说说你的看法. 不过我开始觉得监察员对 Daleks 的看法是对的

699
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:09,844
Their original thinking terrifies me.
If we can control them, fine. But if not...
他们的想法吓着我了. 如果我们能控制住他们, 那还好. 但如果不能...

700
00:55:11,572 --> 00:55:12,082
Yes?
怎样?

701
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:17,334
Then I shall have them destroyed. It's too dangerous.
那我就要把他们销毁. 这太危险了

702
00:55:17,501 --> 00:55:22,634
The Examiner knows something about them that we don't.
I'm going to ask his advice.
监察员知道一些我们不知道的事情. 我要去问问他的建议.

703
00:55:23,422 --> 00:55:26,487
I wouldn't bring the Examiner into it if I were you.
如果我是你的话, 我不会把监察员扯进来.

704
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,244
And why not?
为什么不呢?

705
00:55:27,744 --> 00:55:30,060
You want him to find out about Resno?
你想让他发现 Resno 的事吗?

706
00:55:30,566 --> 00:55:32,980
Oh, a little accident. How is he? Is he better?
哦, 一点小事故. 他怎样了? 好些了吗?

707
00:55:33,189 --> 00:55:33,909
He's dead.
他死了.

708
00:55:36,321 --> 00:55:39,185
What are you talking about? You told me he was...
你在说什么呢? 你告诉我说他只是...

709
00:55:39,395 --> 00:55:41,442
You're busy with the experiments on the Daleks.
你当时在忙着搞 Daleks 的实验.

710
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:47,829
But you should have told me. But... but the body - it'll have to be reported.
但你应该告诉我啊. 不过... 尸体怎么办 - 这事得上报.

711
00:55:48,174 --> 00:55:50,597
Don't worry, no one will find the body.
别担心, 没人会发现尸体.

712
00:55:52,046 --> 00:55:56,274
Oh Janley, you've done a terrible thing.
哦 Janley, 你干了一件很糟糕的事情.

713
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,760
The experiments on the Daleks were more important.
Daleks 的实验更加重要.

714
00:55:59,144 --> 00:56:02,048
More important than human life? No. No, I won't accept that.
比人命更重要? 不, 不, 我不会接受这个.

715
00:56:03,613 --> 00:56:08,382
You will. You must! Your carelessness was the cause of Resno's death.
你会的. 你必须! 是你的粗心大意导致了 Resno 的死亡.

716
00:56:08,613 --> 00:56:13,382
You murdered him. It's only your word against mine.
是你杀死了他. 除了我的证词, 你找不到别人证明

717
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:18,087
I won't be blackmailed by you!
我不会被你勒索的!

718
00:56:18,498 --> 00:56:23,185
All I want is for you to go on as you are.
Scientific discovery can't stop dead, Lesterson.
我想要的只是你继续干你的事. 科学发现不应该在死亡面前停步, Lesterson.

719
00:56:24,626 --> 00:56:26,854
I told the guard that no-one was to be allowed in.
我告诉过保安没人可以进来.

720
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,810
"Accord every access" remember?
"授予一切权限" 记得吗?

721
00:56:29,035 --> 00:56:30,245
We're looking for Polly.
我们正在找寻 Polly.

722
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:32,450
Well, she isn't here, and I haven't seen her.

00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:33,667
Well, she's been kidnapped.
她被绑架了.

724
00:56:33,906 --> 00:56:35,303
Oh, it sounds a little unlikely.
哦, 听起来不太可能啊.

725
00:56:35,483 --> 00:56:37,641
Oh it does, does it? Well, we've got this note which tells us so.
很可能, 对不? 看, 我们还收到了这样字条, 上面是这样说的.

726
00:56:37,778 --> 00:56:40,508
I'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about it.
我很抱歉, 这事我什么也不知道.

727
00:56:41,589 --> 00:56:42,400
Lesterson?

728
00:56:42,684 --> 00:56:43,167
Yes?
什么?

729
00:56:44,132 --> 00:56:46,799
You haven't been building Daleks, have you?
你没在建造 Daleks 吧, 有吗?

730
00:56:46,991 --> 00:56:49,994
Building? No I wouldn't know how to begin.
建造? 不, 我都不知道怎么开始.

731
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:52,425
And there were only three in the capsule?
舱体里面当时只有三个?

732
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:53,262
Yes.
是的

733
00:56:54,864 --> 00:56:59,913
Well we've just seen four. One in the Governor's office and three in the corridor!
但我们刚才看见了四个. 一个在总督的办公室, 三个在走廊!

734
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:02,999
But that's not possible!
但那是不可能的啊!

735
00:57:03,377 --> 00:57:07,434
There's only one explanation. The Daleks are reproducing themselves!
这只有一个解释. Daleks 正在自我复制!

736
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,930
These things are machines. How could they reproduce?
他们只是机器而已, 怎么能自我复制呢?

737
00:57:10,224 --> 00:57:13,777
Machines! What makes you think they're just machines.
机器! 凭什么你认为他们只是机器.

738
00:57:13,924 --> 00:57:18,777
The Daleks are brilliant engineers.
Nothing is beyond them given the right materials.
Daleks 是非常卓越的工程师, 只要有足够的材料, 没谁比他们厉害.

739
00:57:19,879 --> 00:57:20,845
What?
什么

740
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,297
I said nothing is beyond them given the right materials.
我说只要有足够的材料, 没谁比他们厉害.

741
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:25,284
Oh...
噢...

742
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:26,710
Lesterson, what's the matter?
Lesterson, 怎么回事?

743
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:27,458
Oh...
噢...

744
00:57:28,802 --> 00:57:30,779
Leave him alone. He's just been overworking, that's all.
让他一个人呆会儿. 他劳累过度了, 仅此而已.

745
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:31,856
Well, he looks bad.
嗯, 他看来比较糟糕.

746
00:57:32,057 --> 00:57:35,660
Will you both go away. Guard! It's you - badgering him with questions.
你俩能不能离开. 保安! 就是你 - 拿些问题来纠缠他

747
00:57:35,857 --> 00:57:38,160
You've done nothing but hound him ever since you arrived on Vulcan.
自从你到 Vulcan 来, 除了干扰他你什么事情都没干.

748
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:40,748
Bragen's orders were that no one was to be admitted.
Bragen 的命令是不让任何人进来.

749
00:57:41,076 --> 00:57:42,288
Yes, but I thought that the... the Examiner.
是的, 但是我觉得 ... 监察员....

750
00:57:42,514 --> 00:57:44,922
He attacked Lesterson. Get them out of here. Both of them.
他攻击了 Lesterson. 把他赶出去. 把他们俩.

751
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,189
He did not attack Lesterson.
他没有攻击 Lesterson.

752
00:57:46,544 --> 00:57:47,346
Out, do you hear?!
出去, 听见了吗?!

753
00:57:49,693 --> 00:57:50,755
All right, all right.
好吧, 好吧.

754
00:57:56,974 --> 00:58:01,446
Janley here. Tell Valmar to come over to the lab right away. Good.
我是 Janley. 告诉 Valmar 马上到实验室来一趟. 好

755
00:58:03,888 --> 00:58:06,553
Well, we're still no nearer finding Polly. What are we hanging about here for?
我们还是没有找到 Polly. 在这里闲着做什么呢?

756
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:09,649
Ben, I've found a message in code.
Ben, 我在文字里看到了一个消息.

757
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:11,089
Oh, I can't do crosswords.
哦, 我不会做填字游戏.

758
00:58:12,734 --> 00:58:23,032
Meeting tonight, 2000 hours. R O C K E T - Rocket.
R O O M - Room. P. Rocket Room P!
今晚会议, 晚上 20:00. R O C K E T - Rocket. R O O M - Room. P. 火箭室 P !

759
00:58:30,545 --> 00:58:36,335
It's the rebels way of calling a meeting.
Only tonight we're going to be there - early.
这是叛乱分子召集会议的方法, 今晚我们得去那里 - 得早到.

760
00:58:36,953 --> 00:58:39,639
Yeah, maybe we're nearer finding Polly than I thought.
嘢, 也许能有线索找到 Polly.

761
00:58:59,356 --> 00:59:04,860
Now, we're going to demonstrate something.
You section leaders can pass on what you've seen.
现在, 我们要展示一点东西. 你们这些分队头目可以把你们看见的事情回去传达一下

762
00:59:05,356 --> 00:59:08,860
So far, we've been concerned with testing the strength of the Governor with a few acts of sabotage.
到目前为止, 我们还只是进行了几次破坏活动, 主要是为了试试总督的力量

763
00:59:09,356 --> 00:59:12,860
But now, we're ready to take over.
但现在, 我们准备要夺权了.

764
00:59:13,411 --> 00:59:18,819
What is that thing? I've seen them moving about,
but all we've been told is that it's a machine Lesterson discovered.
这是什么东西? 我看他们来回转, 但只是告诉我们说是 Lesterson 发现的一种机器.

765
00:59:19,074 --> 00:59:19,793
Valmar?

766
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:23,033
Well, Lesterson removed the armaments of the Daleks he discovered.
看, 这些 Daleks 是 Lesterson 发现的, 他移除了他们的的武器装备

767
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,033
I've rearmed this one, but with a controlling device.
我又重新给这个装上了, 但多接了一个控制器.

768
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:30,033
We can regulate the fire power and turn it off and on whenever we choose.
我们随时可以调节枪的火力, 甚至关闭它.

769
00:59:31,117 --> 00:59:32,490
Shall we have the demonstration now?
我们可以演示了吗?

770
00:59:35,881 --> 00:59:41,018
This screen is two inch thick tungsten steel. Right, Valmar.

771
00:59:42,842 --> 00:59:45,107
Fire at the screen.
对着屏幕开火.

772
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:52,018
Quiet! You must keep quiet. We're too vulnerable here.
安静! 你们必须保持安静. 你们太容易被发现了.

773
00:59:52,267 --> 00:59:54,113
But, you can't control a thing like that. It'll turn on us!
但是你控制不住这样的东西, 它会攻击我们的!

774
00:59:54,282 --> 00:59:55,131
No it won't.
不, 它不会的.

775
00:59:55,869 --> 00:59:56,918
Now, what about the girl?
现在说下, 那女孩怎么办?

776
00:59:58,116 --> 00:59:59,820
We've got her safely locked up. Never fear.
我们把她锁起来了, 不用担心

777
01:00:00,057 --> 01:00:01,306
I think the best thing for us to do is...
我觉得我们最好是...

778
01:00:01,453 --> 01:00:02,881
Hear that? Maybe they'll say were she is.
听到了吗? 说不定他们会说出把她藏哪儿了

779
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:04,786
Who's there?
谁在那里?

780
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,956
You stay there, I'll distract them. Find out where Polly is.
你待在这里, 我去引开他们. 找出 Polly 在哪里

781
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:07,747
No!
不!

782
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:08,679
Help! Help!
救命! 救命!

783
01:00:08,995 --> 01:00:11,453
The guards will have heard that! Come on we've got to get out of here!
保安会听见的! 我们得赶紧离开这里!

784
01:00:11,509 --> 01:00:14,119
You might as well come out. We know you're there.
你最好也出来吧. 我们知道你在那儿

785
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:25,431
Bragen!

786
01:00:25,687 --> 01:00:28,477
Of course. Who else is fitted to be leader of the rebels?
当然. 否则还有谁适合当这些人的领导?

787
01:00:28,724 --> 01:00:30,760
No doubt you want to be leader of the Daleks too.
毫无疑问你也相当 Daleks 的领导.

788
01:00:30,966 --> 01:00:32,485
I am the leader of the Daleks.
我的确是 Daleks 的领导

789
01:00:32,674 --> 01:00:34,924
Well see if you can stop this one from killing me.
看看你能不能阻止这家伙杀我

790
01:00:35,851 --> 01:00:44,509
Stop! You heard me, that's an order. Turn away. Fetch the guard.
停止! 你听到了, 这是命令. 转身, 去吧保安叫来

791
01:00:47,136 --> 01:00:50,654
I obey.
我-遵命

792
01:00:56,397 --> 01:00:58,568
You hope to have it both ways, Bragen.
你还真会两条腿走路啊, Bragen.

793
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:02,568
But how will you look in front of the Governor, when I explain your dual role to him?
不过到了总督面前你会变成什么样子, 一旦我向他揭示你的双重身份的话?

794
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:04,799
The Governor will hardly listen to an impostor.
总督不太可能相信一个冒名顶替者的话

795
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:08,218
An impostor? How do you propose to prove that?
冒名顶替者? 你打算怎么证明这个?

796
01:01:08,729 --> 01:01:12,439
My guards are now going to produce the body of the real Examiner from the mercury swamp.
我的保安正在水银沼泽打捞那个真监察员的尸体

797
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:13,826

The one you pretended to be.
被你假冒的那个

799
01:01:15,387 --> 01:01:19,020
Murder's a far worse crime than impersonation.
谋杀罪比冒名顶替严重多了

800
01:01:19,246 --> 01:01:24,719
Yes, but you can't prove I'm a murderer, while I can prove that you're an impostor.
是的, 但你没法证明我是个杀人犯, 而我却可以证明你是假冒的.

801
01:01:32,133 --> 01:01:33,490
Ah... Oh...
啊... 噢...

802
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:44,382
You sent for me?
你-叫我-过来?

803

他们在一起密谋什么! 噢, 我居然没发现?

806
01:02:02,578 --> 01:02:07,485
The Examiner was right. They are evil!
监察员是对的, 他们是邪恶的!

807
01:02:19,265 --> 01:02:24,886
There are four. They can't be reproducing!

它们忘记了是该由我控制! 我重新给了它们生命复活了它们

01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:36,666
Well, Bragen - these trips are becoming more and more demanding.
唉, Bragen - 这一趟趟的似乎越来越吃力了

851
01:08:37,095 --> 01:08:38,277
I didn't expect you, Governor.
没想到你会出现, 总督

852
01:08:38,524 --> 01:08:42,478
Ah, I had as much as I could stand. Well? What's been happening here?
啊, 再往外跑我就有点受不了了. 怎么样? 这里发生了什么?

853
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:44,034
One moment.
等会儿.

854
01:08:44,558 --> 01:08:45,671
I asked you a question, man.
我问你问题呢, 伙计.

855
01:08:46,231 --> 01:08:47,016
I heard you.
我听见了.

856
01:08:47,428 --> 01:08:52,083
Look, your work can wait. You can hand over to me tomorrow.
I want to hear about the Examiner.
嘿, 你的工作可以先放放. 明天转交回我就行了. 我想听听监察员的情况.

857
01:08:52,884 --> 01:08:56,682
He's an impostor, Governor. Possibly a murderer as well.
他是个假冒的, 总督. 还很可能是个谋杀犯

858
01:08:56,884 --> 01:09:00,182
We have just discovered the body of the real Examiner in the mercury swamp.
我们刚在水银沼泽里面发现了真监察员的尸体.

859
01:09:01,864 --> 01:09:04,496
I hope you're sure of your facts, Bragen.
我期望你说的情况都是事实, Bragen.

860
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:05,430
Quite sure.
相当确定.

861
01:09:06,281 --> 01:09:09,174
This could have far-reaching consequences.
这可能会有长远的后果.

862
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:13,637
As far as I am concerned, there's nothing more to be said.
So if there's nothing further...
就我所知, 这没什么需要补充的了. 如果没有其它事情...

863
01:09:13,818 --> 01:09:18,746
Nothing further! Who the devil do you think you're talking to?
Stand up when you're speaking to me man!
没有其它! 你以为你在跟谁说话? 跟我说话的时候站起来!

864
01:09:19,977 --> 01:09:22,245
I prefer to remain seated.
我更愿意继续坐着.

865
01:09:22,517 --> 01:09:26,296
Do you now?! We'll soon see about that. Guards!
是吗?! 我们就来看看. 保安!

866
01:09:27,217 --> 01:09:28,777
Take this man out of my office.
把这个人带出我的办公室.

867
01:09:30,155 --> 01:09:32,279
Did you hear what I said? That's an order!
你们没有听见我说的吗? 这是命令!

868
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:35,498
You forget, my dear Hensell. They're not your guards - they're mine.
你忘记了, 我亲爱的 Hensell. 他们不是你的保安 - 他们是我的.

869
01:09:35,656 --> 01:09:36,680
I am the Governor!
我是总督!

870
01:09:36,963 --> 01:09:41,572
No. Not now. I am.
不. 现在不是了. 我才是.

871
01:09:42,102 --> 01:09:43,987
Oh, I see. Your guards, eh?
哦, 我明白了. 你的保安, 呃?

872
01:09:44,102 --> 01:09:48,987
Yes, Quinn warned me about your guards,
but we all took them too lightly, didn't we?
是了, Quinn 警告过我关于你的保安的事情, 但我们都没太重视?

873
01:09:49,174 --> 01:09:52,118
When the people hear that I am being kept a prisoner in my own capital...
果人们听说我在自己的首府被囚禁起来了...

874
01:09:52,353 --> 01:09:54,886
The people will do exactly as they are told, Hensell.
他们只会按照我们告诉他们的情况做出反应, Hensell.

875
01:09:56,664 --> 01:10:00,643
It will, of course, be easier for them if you co-operate with us.
当然, 如果你与我们合作的话, 事情会更容易一点.

876
01:10:10,618 --> 01:10:12,877
You're the last man I expected to see here.
你是我最没想到会在这里见到的人

877
01:10:13,181 --> 01:10:17,692
Well your imprisonment hasn't been entirely wasted.
It's brought your enemy out into...
你被关起来倒不是完全没好处, 至少把你的敌人暴露...

878
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:19,898
Bragen? I've known that all along.
Bragen 是吧? 我一直都知道的.

879
01:10:20,073 --> 01:10:23,075
Yes. But, ah, did you know that he was the leader of the rebels?
是的. 但是你是否知道他是叛乱分子的头目

880
01:10:23,615 --> 01:10:24,973
Hmm. Work's by sound, does it?
唔. 靠声音驱动的, 是吧?

881
01:10:31,486 --> 01:10:34,937
Wait there. Guards, dismissed.
等着. 保安, 你们可以出去了.

882
01:10:39,696 --> 01:10:44,005
So Bragen, you want my co-operation, do you?
怎样, Bragen, 你需要我的合作, 对吧?

883
01:10:44,427 --> 01:10:49,036
It would save bloodshed. I might even let you keep the title of Governor.
这样能少流些血. 我甚至可以让你继续留着总督的头衔.

884
01:10:49,696 --> 01:10:56,708
Might you now?! I'll tell you what you will do. You'll order
your guards to disarm and place yourself under arrest immediately!
你会吗?! 我来告诉你你将会做什么. 你让你的保安都解除武装, 立即逮捕你自己!

885
01:10:57,272 --> 01:11:01,943
So you reject my offer? I thought it a generous one in the circumstances.
这么说你拒绝我的提议? 我还觉得在当前情形下这是个挺慷慨的提议呢.

886
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:04,710
What circumstances?
当前什么情形?

887
01:11:04,936 --> 01:11:05,645
Look at this.
看看这个.

888
01:11:06,897 --> 01:11:07,874
What is it?
这是什么?

889
01:11:08,448 --> 01:11:10,422
The reason that the colony is now mine.
这就是为什么这个基地现在是我的.

890
01:11:14,114 --> 01:11:17,604
Is it a weapon of some kind?
这是某种武器?

891
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:22,368
I'll arrange a demonstration for you. Do you still refuse my offer?
我给你安排一个演示吧. 你还是拒绝我的提议吗?

892
01:11:22,966 --> 01:11:25,354
I will not be intimidated.
我不会妥协的.

893
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:32,399
Of course not. In character to the last, Hensell. Kill him!
当然不. 执迷不悟啊, Hensell. 杀了他!

894
01:11:43,351 --> 01:11:48,283
Why do human beings kill human beings?
为什么-人类-杀死-人类?

895
01:11:48,602 --> 01:11:49,538
Get on with your work!
去干你的活去!

896
01:11:49,651 --> 01:11:52,218
Yes, master. I obey.

是的, 服从我! 从现在开始, 我要每个人都要绝对服从!

I'll have to check the cable circuit now. Otherwise, it's just as you asked for.
现在我还得检查一下线缆回路. 否则的话, it's just as you asked for.(FIXME)

01:12:14,345 --> 01:12:15,331
Very well.
很好

900
01:12:15,618 --> 01:12:19,409
Why can't you carry on with the power you're drawing from the colony? Why go to all this trouble?
为什么你们不直接利用你从基地抽取到的能量呢? 费这个劲做什么?

901
01:12:19,653 --> 01:12:26,016
Until now, we have had to recharge from the colony supply.
到目前-为止, 我们-还是-要用-基地-电力-充电

902
01:12:26,653 --> 01:12:32,016
With static power, the Daleks will be twice as useful.
采用-静电, Daleks-将会-加倍-有用.

903
01:12:32,558 --> 01:12:32,954
Valmar, quick!

904
01:12:33,288 --> 01:12:33,787

Come on.
得了

01:12:49,017 --> 01:12:55,426
An electrical circuit of their own supplying static electricity!
I wonder how much longer we've got?
他们自己的静电供电线路! 我好奇我们还有多少时间?

I didn't realise they'd have a circuit of their own.

Are you all right?

On their static power supply.

是的, 我知道. 他跑出来是为了让我... 噢, 这就说来话长了

But don't worry. That boy can take care of himself!

Did you hear that? That won't help.

934
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:48,724
I can answer that.
我能回答这个.

01:14:48,891 --> 01:14:54,658
He wanted to destroy the Daleks, so one of them killed him. Now, I'm declaring martial law.
他想要销毁 Daleks, 所以其中一个就杀死了他. 现在, 我宣布戒严

Wait. The revolution is not quite over yet.
等等. 革命还没完全结束.

我们还要做什么? Hensell 已经死了, 你成了新总督. 战斗也结束了.

如果这群闹事的人放任自流的话, 你觉得我这把椅子能坐稳吗?

他们昨天反叛的是 Hensell, 明天就可能轮到我了.

算了, 让他们闹事, 跟他们说保安已经掌握控制权了

是的. 我们一路走了这么久, 你和我. 你现在要回那边去吗?

Whose side are you on anyway?

I thought I was going to be on the winning side.

What changed your mind?
怎么改变主意了?

980

Bragen. The colony's become too small for him. He wants us out of the way now.
Bragen. 这个基地对他来说太小了. 他现在不想要任何人挡他的道.

Yeah, well it often happens that way, mate, when you follow blokes like him.
是的, 这种事最后经常是这样, 伙计, 当你跟着他这样的家伙.

Look, I'm going to try and get your friends here, if I can. So wait here.
看, 我要去试着把你的朋友们找来, 尽我所能. 你等在这里.

01:18:18,306 --> 01:18:22,129
People of Vulcan. This is your new Governor talking to you.
Vulcan 人民请注意. 现在是你们的新总督在讲话

住在卫星城和内城的群众请保持冷静

Did Valmar find you, then?

995
01:18:51,556 --> 01:18:53,021
What's this about Valmar?
又有 Valmar 什么事?

Well it seems Bragen's gone power-mad. He wants the rebels to revolt, then he can finish them off.
是这样, 看起来 Bragen 已经疯狂了. 他故意让叛乱分子起来闹事, 然后他好再把他们消灭掉.

The Daleks won't care who they fight. They'll exterminate every human being on this planet.
Daleks 不会在乎跟谁打. 他们会毁灭这个星球上的每一个人.

All right. All right.

Orders received. Daleks commence extermination.

I overheard your conversation with Bragen.
我无意中听到你跟 Bragen 的谈话

1008
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:46,080
But you can't stand up to the Daleks, so your plan will come to nothing.
但你们是没法站起来对抗 Daleks的, 因此你们的计划将会落空.

1009
01:19:46,513 --> 01:19:47,765
Not my plan - Bragen's.
不是我的计划 - 是 Bragen 的.

1010
01:19:47,933 --> 01:19:48,780
But that's the same thing.

1011

Not any more.

01:19:49,765 --> 01:19:51,776
You expect me to believe that?

I came here to do exactly what you've done.
我来这里是要做你已经做了的事情

1014

Let Bragen see what the Daleks are like. He doesn't know how strong they are.
让 Bragen 看看 Daleks 到底是怎样的东西. 他不知道它们有多强悍.

He's got to be stopped.

1018
01:20:07,031 --> 01:20:09,684
We will fight for you.
我们-将-战斗-为你们

1019

Believe me, Val, it's the only way to save all our lives.
相信我, Val, 这是救我们性命的唯一方法.

Did you know that the Daleks are duplicating?

Take us to the centre of your group.

Can we trust them?

I dunno.

01:20:47,504 --> 01:20:49,779
It had better, or we're done for! Out you go.

1031
01:20:50,648 --> 01:20:52,789
Ah!... Ah!... What's happening?
啊!... 啊!... 发生了什么?

1032

Daleks. 他们在走廊集结, 都快挤满了. 我们得回到 Lesterson 的实验室去.

Cut the Dalek gun off!

The answer must be here somewhere.
肯定得有别的什么方法.

1056

Ssssh!

01:22:32,991 --> 01:22:33,566
Ah!...

1058

Everything! They even know what you're thinking.
你们必须绝对安静. 它们知道当前的所有事情, 所有! 它们甚至知道你在想什么.

Where do they get their power from, Lesterson?
他们的能量从哪里来的, Lesterson?

啊, 我试过去切断电源, 但离我太远了.

Marvellous creatures. You have to admire them.

But we've got to stop them!
但我们要去阻止它们!

1063

哦, 干这事儿太晚了. 它们是一个新的种族, 明白不.

1064
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:16,909
Taking over from homo sapiens. Man's had his day. Finished now.
开始从智人手中接管世界了. 人类终有这一天, 都结束了.

The static circuit is nearly complete.

1066
01:23:29,887 --> 01:23:33,808
Soon we can abandon the power we are using.
马上-我们-可以-抛弃-正在-使用的-电能.

The humans are being exterminated.
人类-将要-被-毁灭.

Take it easy, Polly.
别怕, Polly.

我们不能做点什么吗?! 他们在谋杀所有人, 一个接一个!

都是你造成的. 一开始你为什么要给它们提供能量?

1074
01:24:21,831 --> 01:24:24,113
Well, I could control it, you see.
哦, 我当时可以控制住的, 你看.

1075
01:24:24,331 --> 01:24:32,613
And then Janley got one of her men - Valmar, I think it was,
yes - and he rigged up a secret cable.
然后 Janley 找了一个她的人 - Valmar, 好像是这个名字 - 他安装了一个秘密线缆.

1076

It's carrying power directly from the colony's supply.
那个线缆直接由基地电厂提供电力.

1077
01:24:37,313 --> 01:24:40,602
Where? Where is it, Lesterson?
哪儿? 在哪儿, Lesterson?

1078
01:24:40,892 --> 01:24:45,249
Valmar's the only one who can answer that. Or the Daleks of course.
Valmar 是唯一能回答这个问题的人. 当然 Daleks 也能

1079
01:24:45,492 --> 01:24:49,449
They know everything. Yes, you should ask the Daleks.
它们知道所有事情, 是的, 你问 Daleks 也可以.

1080
01:24:50,899 --> 01:24:52,371
Then we must find Valmar.

I'll go.

你必须舍她而去了, Valmar.

1084

Section One? Where's your report? Are you there Section One?
一分队? 你们的情况如何? 你们还在吗一分队?

二分队? 二分队? 为什么不回答? 你们能听到吗二分队?

这里是 Bragen. 我现在同 Daleks 讲话.

Daleks, listen to me. I am the Governor. You must work for me.
Daleks, 听我说, 我是总督. 你们必须为我工作.

1089
01:26:48,621 --> 01:26:51,954
Do not trust the rebels. I will give you whatever you want.
不要相信叛乱分子. 我会给予你们想要的任何东西

1090
01:26:52,221 --> 01:26:55,054
But immobilise your guns. This is the Governor speaking.
但要立即放下武器. 这里是总督在讲话.

1091
01:26:56,383 --> 01:26:58,118
He's nuts, trying to talk to the Daleks.
他是个蠢蛋, 居然想跟 Daleks 谈条件.

1092
01:26:59,633 --> 01:27:01,469
Lesterson, what's in that cupboard?
Lesterson, 这个柜子里面是什么?

1093
01:27:01,993 --> 01:27:03,559
Nothing. I think It's quite empty.

1094
01:27:03,739 --> 01:27:05,325
Well, come on, Polly, we'll be safe in there, love.
正好, 来吧, Polly, 我们躲在这里面比较安全, 很好.

你们听到我的话了没, Daleks?! 你们必须服从我的命令!

没用的, Bragen. Daleks 早就不服从你的命令了.

1097
01:27:12,669 --> 01:27:13,846
Ah! Guards!
啊! 保安!

1098

That depends.

Well, get them!

Well, they will be intercepted by the Daleks.
但他们也会被 Daleks 拦截住.

1102
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:26,672
Exactly! It will draw them away from here and give the Doctor a chance to deal with them.
正是! 这会把它们从这里引开, 给博士去寻找对付它们的机会.

1103
01:27:26,861 --> 01:27:29,001
I refuse to allow my guards to be sacrificed.
我拒绝让我的保安们去做牺牲.

1104
01:27:29,153 --> 01:27:33,656
In that case the Daleks will destroy everything on this colony.
那样的话 Daleks 会把这个基地所有的东西都毁掉.

1105
01:27:37,103 --> 01:27:41,678
Guards. This is Bragen speaking. All units will report immediately to the capital.
保安. 我是 Bragen. 所有小组马上到首府报告

1106
01:27:42,103 --> 01:27:44,678
Be prepared to face the rebel Daleks.
注意可能会遭遇造反的 Daleks.

1107
01:27:45,521 --> 01:27:47,286
Ben! Polly!

1108
01:27:47,658 --> 01:27:49,158
Doctor, did you hear what Bragen said?

Yes, I did.

Well I only hope the Daleks do go for the guards.
我只能期望 Daleks 都跑到保安那里去.

A lot of the Daleks went out just now.
好多 Daleks 刚才出去了.

1112
01:27:54,392 --> 01:27:56,252
Good, because we're going inside. Come on Valmar.
很好, 因为我们要进去. 快来 Valmar.

1113
01:27:59,356 --> 01:28:02,903
Ben, give us that spare cable over there. Polly, keep watch at the door.
Ben, 把那根闲置的线缆给我们. Polly, 你负责在门口放哨.

Well, you know what you're doing?

Of course I do!
我当然知道!

1116
01:28:07,067 --> 01:28:09,498
Well, why can't you just take all the plugs out and cut the power off?
嗯, 为什么你不直接把插头都拔掉, 这样不就都切断了?

1117
01:28:09,643 --> 01:28:11,423
Because I prefer to do it my way!
因为我更喜欢按我的方法来!

1118
01:28:12,002 --> 01:28:13,044
Look out!
小心!

1119
01:28:19,872 --> 01:28:26,018
Static power is being stored. We can dismantle the human electric system.
静电-能量-已经-储存. 我们-可以-拆除-人类-电力-系统.

1120
01:28:26,274 --> 01:28:29,469
The law of the Daleks is in force.
Daleks-法律-已经-生效

1121
01:28:29,712 --> 01:28:31,907
Extermination of humans.

1122

Our cables have been moved.

And I could tell you who did it!

What were you doing in there?

We do not need humans now.

Out of control..

I don't know.
我不知道

1135

It seems that your friend, the Examiner, was successful after all.
看来你的朋友, 那个监察员, 获得了最终胜利.

1136
01:30:51,265 --> 01:30:53,885
Now I shall restore law and order on this planet.
现在我要恢复这个星球的法律和秩序了.

Not your law, Bragen. That's finished for good.
不是你的法律, Bragen. 一切已经结束了.

1138

You'll obey me, or...
你要服从我, 否则...

Your day is over, Bragen. No one will obey you now.
你的日子已经结束了, Bragen. 现在没人再服从你了.

1141
01:31:03,665 --> 01:31:04,749
Valmar.

1142
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:11,889
He was a murderer.

1143

Enough of guns.
流了够多的血了.

1144
01:31:14,725 --> 01:31:21,260
There's a lot of clearing up to be done. We will rebuild together.
What is the extent of the damage?
还有好多收尾的工作要做. 我们得一起来重建. 损毁的程度怎样?

Are you all right?
你没事吧?

Eh? What happened?

1150
01:31:33,686 --> 01:31:35,485
You destroyed the Daleks, that's what you did!

1152

You know you did!
是的, 你知道的!

1153
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:47,320
You used the power from the colony's electric supply - overfed it
- and blew up their temporary static circuit. Well didn't you?
你用光了基地供电系统的电力 - 让它们过载了 - 炸掉了它们的临时静电电路. 干得不错啊?

1154
01:31:48,409 --> 01:31:49,621
Did I do all that?
是我干的吗?

1155
01:31:49,903 --> 01:31:54,502
You may have stopped the Daleks,
but have you any idea of the damage you've done to the colony?
你是阻止了 Daleks, 但你就没想到你对这个基地造成的损害吗?

1156
01:31:55,213 --> 01:31:56,587
Oh. There was a blow back, was there?
哦. 免不了有点后坐力, 是吧?

1157
01:31:56,783 --> 01:32:02,026
A blow back? Our power supply has been destroyed!
It'll be months before we can get things back to normal.
后坐力? 我们的电力供应被毁掉了! 可能需要数月我们才能让事情回归正常.

1158
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:02,881
Valmar!

1159
01:32:03,049 --> 01:32:03,858
That is unfortunate.
那太不幸了.

1160
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:05,706
But did it have to be this way?
但你必须得用这个方法吗?

1161
01:32:05,898 --> 01:32:07,276
I did a lot of damage, did I?
我造成了很大的破坏, 是吧?

1162
01:32:07,654 --> 01:32:08,534
Come on.
得了

1163
01:32:11,881 --> 01:32:16,519
I think we'd better get out of here before they send us the bill.
我觉得我们还是赶紧离开这里吧, 赶在他们送账单过来之前.
