His face, his hair - look at it!
他的脸，他的头发，你看!

3
00:01:32,878 --> 00:01:33,913
He's breathing...
他还在呼吸...

4
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:38,344
...and the TARDIS seems to be normal.
...而且TARDIS看起来很正常

5
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:42,691
Ben, what are we going to do? We can't just leave the Doctor there.
Ben, 我们该怎么办? 我们不能把博士扔那儿不管.

6
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,560
What, him? The Doctor?
什么, 他是博士?


7
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:56,768
Ben, do you remember what he said in the tracking room?
Something about "This old body of mine is wearing a bit thin. "
Ben, 你记得他在跟踪室内说过什么吗? 好像说＂我的旧身体穿了身新皮囊. "

8
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,163
So he gets himself a new one?
这么说他有了个新的?

9
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:00,581
But it's impossible!
但这不可能啊!

10
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:03,916
Not so long ago we'd have been saying that about a lot of things.
不久以前，我们还对好多事情说了这句话.

11
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:07,186
It's over.
过去了

12
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,763
It's over.
过去了

13
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:58,097
What are we going to do?
我们该做点什么?

14
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,952
It is the Doctor. I know it is... I think.
他是博士. 我就知道... 我觉得.

15
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:06,242
It's not only his face that's changed
- he doesn't even act like him.
不仅仅是他的脸变了 - 他的行为也不像.

16
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,277
Come on, it's time we sorted this out.
来吧，我们把这事搞清楚.

17
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,306
Now look here!
现在看这儿!

18
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:14,359
Hold that.
停住.

19
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:15,995
And tilt it.
斜点儿

20
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,717
Have you done with this?
你干过这个吗?

21
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:37,442
Put it down, put it down.
放下，放下.

22
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:39,585
Now, what's the game?
现在，玩什么游戏?

23
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:40,479
Ah!
啊!

24
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:43,518
The crusades, from Saladin.
十字军，撒拉丁

25
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:46,594
The Doctor was a great collector, wasn't he!
博士是个收藏家啊!

26
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:48,091
But you're the Doctor!
但你就是博士啊!

27
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,565
Oh, I don't look like him.
哦，我看着不像他.

28
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:52,428
Who are we?
我们是谁?

29
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:53,832
Don't you know?
你不知道吗?

30
00:03:58,442 --> 00:03:59,484
Extermination!

31
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:06,242
Now look, the Doctor always wore this.
So if you're him, it should fit now, shouldn't it?
看，博士总戴着这个，如果你是他，这个应该大小合适，对不对?

32
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:09,929
There - that settles it.
看 - 掉下来了.

33
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:13,816
I'd like to see a butterfly fit into a chrysalis case
after it's spread its wings.
我想看看蝴蝶展开翅膀后怎么适应它的蛹

34
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:15,311
Then you did change!
你真的变了!

35
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:17,927
Life depends on change... and renewal.
生命依赖于变化... 和新生.

36
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:23,997
The Doctor kept a diary, didn't he?
博士持有一本日记，对吧?

37
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:25,162
Yes.
是的.

38
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:28,379
I thought so. Now, I wonder where?
我记得是，不过现在在哪儿呢?

39
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:30,354
I wonder where?
在哪儿呢?

40
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:32,868
He's a very different Doctor, Ben.
他真跟博士有点不同, Ben.

41
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:35,650
Yeah, maybe. Just where do we stand, though?
嗯, 很可能. 不过我们现在到底什么情况?

42
00:04:56,167 --> 00:05:02,434
Doctor? Doctor, what's going to happen to us?
博士? 博士, 我们会怎样?

43
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:11,046
I think... I think we must have landed for sometime.
I think it's time we went for a stroll.
我觉得... 我觉得我们着陆有一阵子了. 我觉得我们该出去逛逛了.

44
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:13,782
But you don't know where we've landed!
但你都不知道我们着陆到哪里了!

45
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,067
No, you haven't checked the oxygen or the temperature or anything!
别，你还没有检查氧气和温度，什么都没还没检查！

46
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:25,253
Oxygen density one-seven-two, radiation nil, temperature...
eighty-six - strong suggestion of mercury deposits.
氧气浓度172，辐射零，温度86。有较强的水银沉淀.

46
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:31,253
Satisfied, Ben? Now, are you two coming or are you not?
满意了吗, Ben? 现在，你们两个来还是不来?

47
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:35,794
He does know us! He said "Ben", didn't you hear him?
他真认识我们! 他喊你 "Ben", 听到了吧?

48
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:37,463
Yeah, I heard.
是的, 我听到了

49
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:51,082
Are you coming, you two?
来不来，你俩?

50
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:52,136
Hello?
哈罗?

51
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:57,493
Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello?
哈罗? 有人吗? 哈罗?

52
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:02,250
Hello? Why don't they come?
哈罗? 他们怎么还不来?

53
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:08,774
Ah, so you've come at last. I'm from Earth. I'm the Examin...
啊, 你终于来了. 我从地球来的. 我是监察员...

54
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:43,441
"Earth Examiner. Accord every access. Vulcan. "
"地球监察员. 授予所有权限. Vulcan. "

55
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:53,071
Whoa, they're hot!
喔, 好热!

56
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:55,298
Hmm, do you think the air's like this everywhere?
唔, 是不是到处的空气都像这样?

57
00:06:55,553 --> 00:07:00,402
Nah - might be just round here.
Don't want too many lung full of it, I know that.
不 - 可能只是这一片才这样. 别使劲吸气, 我知道的.

57
00:06:70,553 --> 00:07:06,402
Here, when I was a kid, we used to live opposite a brewery.
You could take a walk and get tipsy all in one go!
我小的时候住在一家酒坊对面. 还没走完一趟人就醉了!

58
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,065
It's beautiful!
好美啊!

59
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:09,539
No, don't touch it, Polly!
别，别碰, Polly!

60
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:11,069
I wasn't going to.
我没打算碰.

61
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:13,440
No, it's quicksilver - it gets through the pores.
这是水银 - 会从这些气泡里面出来.

62
00:07:13,798 --> 00:07:18,643
Where is the Doctor, or whatever he is, got to?
博士要去哪儿啊？ - 就算他是博士吧

63
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:38,985
So the murdered man was the real Examiner?
所以被谋杀的人就是真的监察员?

64
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:41,242
Well, didn't you see who did it?
那么，你有没有看到是谁干的?

65
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,177
The Doctor got this button though.
博士, 这里多了颗纽扣.

66
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,913
Well, I think it's pretty dull around here.
I don't know why we don't just go back to the TARDIS.
我觉得这挺无聊的. 我不明白我们为什么不回到 TARDIS 去.

67
00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:52,238
Doctor, are you going to let them think you're the real Examiner?
博士，你是想让他们觉得你就是真正的监察员吗?

68
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:56,087
Well, won't that be dangerous?
嗯，那会不会比较危险?

69
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:59,959
Look, why don't you stop blowing that thing and talk to us properly?
看，你能不能不再吹那个，认真跟我们说说?

70
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:00,648
Ben!

71
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:01,882
Now don't you start - it's bad enough with him!
你现在别说话 - 跟他在一起就够糟的了!

72
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:02,879
Well, he hasn't done anything.
他什么也没做.

73
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,912
No, that's just the trouble!
He knows what happened back at the TARDIS,
不，那就是麻烦所在! 他知道那会儿 TARDIS 里发生了什么

73
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:09,912
yet will he tell us? Will he come out and say?
Will he admit to being the Doctor?
他会告诉我们吗? 他会站出来说? 他会承认他就是博士?

74
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,327
Come in!
请进!

75
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:20,991
I am Hensell - the Governor.

76
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,984
If Earth had seen fit to warn us you were coming...

77
00:08:24,195 --> 00:08:29,371
If Earth didn't warn you we were coming, Governor,
they must have had a very good reason. I wonder what it was?
如果地球没告诉你，总督，他们一定有一个很好理由. 我很好奇到底是什么?

78
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:35,254
Now look here - I run this Colony. I'm entitled to know
why you've come to Vulcan. What is your brief?
你看 - 我负责这块基地. 我有权知道你为什么到 Vulcan 来. 简单说说?

79
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,502
I am the Examiner.
我是监察员.

80
00:08:36,852 --> 00:08:38,134
Why are you here?
为什么来这儿?

81
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:43,049
To examine. And I intend to start my examination at once!
监察. 我现在就要开始检查!

82
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:49,250
Someone's leaked reports about these rebel groups
- that's it, isn't it?
有人密报说这里有人叛乱，是为了这个吧，是吗?

83
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:52,007
There is Lesterson's capsule.
应该是 Lesterson 的那个舱体.

84
00:08:52,206 --> 00:08:55,446
Internal affairs are my business, Bragen.
Please don't interfere!
内部事物归我管， Bragen. 请不要来干扰我们!

85
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,067
Please go on.
请继续.

86
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:02,817
The capsule. It was found in a mercury swamp.
It must have been here for centuries before the Earth colony arrived.
这个舱体，是在一个水银沼泽里发现的. 可能在那里已经几个世纪了, 比地球殖民者还早

87
00:09:02,957 --> 00:09:06,539
I felt it might be dangerous, it might contain bacteria.
我觉得它可能很危险, 它可能带有细菌.

88
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:09,606
I shall examine the capsule.
我应该检查一下这个舱体

89
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:34,159
Where did you get this?
你在哪里得到这个的?

90
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:36,093
It dropped from the capsule.
从舱体上掉下来的.

91
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,450
Dropped?
掉下来?

92
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:39,960
Yes, when it was being hauled into the laboratory.
是的, 把它拖进实验室的时候.

92
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:44,760
But, you can see! This metal could revolutionise space travel.
不过，你看! 这种金属可以会对我们的太空旅行技术产生革命性影响.

92
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:49,660
That's why I'm insisting that we open it.
Well, who knows what other marvels there may be inside?
这也是为什么我坚持要打开舱体. 谁知道里面还有什么其它神奇的东西?

93
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:52,262
But Lesterson, I didn't think you could open it?
不过 Lesterson, 我没想到你能打开它?

94
00:09:52,779 --> 00:10:00,931
Well, I have a theory. I'm convinced that the opening mechanism
on the other side is either here, or here.
我有一个理论. 我推断打开的方法是在两端，要么这边，要么这边.

95
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:02,880
Extermination...
终结!...

96
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:08,149
Now, my theory is that I can insert a laser ray in this ridge here.
我的理论是可以在这个背脊处注入激光束.

97
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:13,508
The ray spreads, fuses the opening device and gets us in.
光束散开, 触发开门设备，我们就可以进去了.

98
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:16,994
Examiner, I shall have to make it your responsibility.
监察员, 我觉得该你来决策了.

99
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:20,202
A laser? Why not? It shouldn't be too difficult.
激光? 没问题? 不会太难.

100
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,385
Well, we'll try the other side.
我们来试试另外一边.

101
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,903
Hmm, it's a bit... disappointing.
唔, 有一点... 让人失望.

102
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:53,492
Not really. This is just an entry bay, isn't it?
不会. 这只是门廊, 对吧?

103
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,808
Yes, I... I suppose so.
是的... 我觉得是.

104
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:57,660
Well, this doesn't get us very far does it?
那并没有让我们走多远是吧?

105
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:00,851
Ah, getting into the rest of the capsule will take time, Governor.
进到舱体其它部分就需要时间了，总督.

106
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,208
Well, can't you use that torch thing again?
That must be an opening door.
你不能再用一下那个光束吗？那肯定是一个门.

107
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,344
Well, I should have to measure it up
and find out where the lock mechanism is.
我得考察一下，看看锁机关在哪儿.

108
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,112
And I think we'll leave if for tonight.
我觉得今晚就到此为止吧.

109
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:08,923
Leave it?
到此为止?

110
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:11,112
Leave it for tonight? But what did we come here for?
就这样了? 那我们来这儿干什么?

111
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:12,730
That is my decision, Governor.
这是我的决定，总督.

112
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,113
But, good heavens above, man!
但是，苍天在上!

113
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:16,203
Two hundred years, you say, this has been buried?
两百年，你说它被埋了?

114
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,666
Oh, at least. Now, there must be something in the inner compartment.
哦，至少有. 里面的隔间里一定有什么东西.

115
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,490
We shall be able to find out where it came from originally.
我们应该可以搞明白它是从哪里来的.

116
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:24,335
It didn't come from this planet - Vulcan.
它并不是来自这个星球 - Vulcan.

117
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:27,151
Oh no, no, no. The metal is quite alien.
哦，不不不. 这个金属很外星.

118
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:33,171
Alien, yes. Very alien. Goodnight.
外星，是的. 非常外星. 晚安.

119
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,780
What's he up to now?
他这是怎么了?

120
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,864
Ben, we're not going to let him out of our sight.
Ben, 不要让他离开我们的视线.

121
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:50,045
Well, Lesterson, you got your way. Was it worth
sending for this Examiner? This idiotic Examiner?
好了，Lesterson, 你有路子. 不过你找来这监察员值得吗? 就这个愚蠢的家伙?

122
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:52,088
I didn't send for him. I thought you did.
不是我找来的. 我还以为是你呢.

123
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:55,690
Why don't you let me talk to the Examiner, Hensell?
I can find out what's he's here for.
你为什么不让我跟监察员说话，Hensell? 我能找出他来这里的原因.

124
00:11:55,863 --> 00:11:59,120
No, no, no, no, you keep away from him.
We'll leave him to work with Lesterson here.
不不不, 你离他远点. 我们让他跟 Lesterson 呆一起吧.

124
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:02,120
We've all got enough to do without having to worry about
some amateur critic from Earth interfering.
我们都有太多事情要做，负担不起来自地球的业余批评.

125
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:02,833
But with five minutes, I _...
但只要５分钟, 我 _...

126
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,397
You heard what I said, Quinn.
You won't mind keeping the Examiner busy, Lesterson?
你听到我的话了, Quinn. 你不介意让监察员忙得团团转吧, Lesterson?

126
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:11,397
我不介意你跟他做什么 ... 只要他的鼻子别到我的事情里面来到处嗅.
I don't mind what you do with him so long as you keep his nose...
out of our business.

127
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:12,441
Yes. All right.
好. 没问题.

128
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:14,352
All right. Well, we shall talk about it tomorrow.
就这样. 我们明早再讨论.

129
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:29,041
Ben!

130
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:30,359
What?

131
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:31,809
Shh! He's in the corridor.
嘘! 他在走廊里.

132
00:12:31,998 --> 00:12:32,569
Who is?
谁?

133
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:34,194
The Doctor, you clod! Come on - quick!
博士, 你个笨蛋! 过来 - 快!

134
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:41,863
He's going towards Lesterson's lab.
他往 Lesterson 的实验室去了.

135
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,795
Of course - to the space capsule!
当然 - 那个太空舱!

136
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:44,801
Come on.
来吧

137
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:50,411
Polly, Ben, come in and meet the Daleks.
Polly, Ben, 进来见见 Daleks.

138
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:51,501
What?

The Daleks.
Daleks.

140
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:13,236
You could have opened this before.
你以前就打开过这个.

141
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:15,261
These two pieces of metal are identical.
这两块金属是一样的

142
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,167
I knew I should find them here.
我就知道能在这里找到它们

143
00:14:18,722 --> 00:14:21,262
Ah, they look harmless, not very lively.
啊, 他们看起来是无害的, 并不活跃.

144
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:26,879
Two hundred years in a swamp and you wouldn't look very lively
either. Nothing could live through that, could it?
你想什么呢? 在沼泽里呆200年，你也看起来不活跃。没有什么东西能熬过来，是吧?

145
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,892
Live?
活的?

146
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:29,651
Nothing human, no.
不是人类, 不.

147
00:14:30,107 --> 00:14:31,519
Doctor, look!
博士，看!

148
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:34,174
What's the matter?
怎么回事?

149
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:40,257
Well, there were three Daleks in here!
What's happened to the other one?
这里本来有三个 Daleks 的! 另外一个发生了什么?

150

Doctor, look!
博士, 看！

151
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,612
A light. A torch outside.
要光. 去外面拿个电筒.

152
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:54,833
Did you see it?
你看见了吗?

153
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:55,936
Quickly Ben, quickly!
快点 Ben, 快!

154
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:57,054
What was it?

155
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:17,859
Can you answer me?
能回答我吗?

156
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:21,779
It was a sort of disembodied hand.
A sort of claw. It was horrible!
好像是某种脱离下来的肢体，某种爪子. 好吓人!

157
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,253
No. No, there's nothing.
不. 不, 什么也没有.
没.
不会.

158
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:43,260
You were right - there were three Daleks.
你是对的 - 之前是有三个 Daleks.

159
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:46,363
Do you know what it was?
你知道那是什么?

160
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,848
If there were three, who moved it?
如果之前有三个，谁移动了?

161
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,219
Don't ask me. Lesterson?
别问我. Lesterson?

162
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:01,584
But he hadn't opened the capsule.
但他还没有打开舱体啊.

163
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,805
Now he said he hadn't opened it.
Lets get our facts straight.
他“说”他还没有打开．我们直接去找真相吧.

164
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,705
Aha, excellent! Good thinking, good thinking.
啊哈, 太棒了! 好想法，好想法.

165
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:11,701
What, does that mean you think he's been inside?
什么, 那不是说你觉得他进去过?

166
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:14,132
Perhaps he's been experimenting on the Daleks? Ah.
也许他一直在试验 Daleks? 啊

167
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,688
But... but they're things I...
I mean they're dead. They must be!
但是... 但他们是... 我是说他们已经死了. 肯定是!

168
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,449
This light is dead. Now the watch!
这盏灯是死的吧，现在看看!

169
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:24,933
Do you mean these things just need power?
你是说这些东西只是需要能量?

170
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:29,948
Now, Lesterson's fanatic. The Governor's jealous of his own position.
嗯, Lesterson 太狂热了. 总督太在乎他自己的位置

170
00:16:30,218 --> 00:16:34,548
What does that suggest to you? Dunno. Hadn't thought about it.
这让你想起什么了吗? 不知道. 没想过这个.

170
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:38,548
That all is not well with this colony. Add to that one Dalek!
这个基地所有事情都不太好，现在又多出来个 Dalek!

171
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:41,164
Oh, blimey, you don't half make mountains, don't you? One Dalek?
噢, 天啊, you don't half make mountains, don't you? 就一个 Dalek?

172
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:44,633
Yes! All that is needed to wipe out this entire colony.
是的! 只要一个就可以彻底荡平整个基地了.

173
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:54,678
Examiner?

174
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:01,511
Bragen, don't you ever knock before you enter a room?
Bragen, 你进屋之前从不敲门吗?

175
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:06,362
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I was expecting to find the Examiner here - not you Quinn.
我很抱歉打扰了你. 我以为能在这里找到监察员，不是来找你的，Quinn.

176
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:07,629
Well, he's not here.

177
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:10,913
The Governor gave express instructions that you were
not to contact the Examiner
总督已经明确说过你不能跟监察员接触

177
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:15,013
I find you here. I'm sure you can offer some suitable explanation.
但我发现你在这里，相信你能提供一个合适的解释.

178
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:17,165
I can. But not to you.
我能. 但不是对你.

179
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:20,379
The Examiner is missing. He must be found immediately.
监察员不见了. 得马上找到他.

180
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:23,822
Doctor, look, if they're that dangerous,
what are you going to do about it?
博士，你看, 如果他们有那么危险的话，你打算拿他们怎么办?

181
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:29,990
Save my breath. Would Lesterson listen? Uh, uh. Lesterson listen...
让我喘口气. Lesterson 会听吗? 哦, 哦. Lesterson listen....

181
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:36,390
Exercises the tongue. Try it! Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen....
锻炼一下舌头. 试试 Lesterson listen...

182
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:40,678
Look, they think you're the Examiner, order them
to destroy the Daleks! Well, chuck your weight about.
看，他们认为你是监察员, 让他们把 Daleks 都销毁吧! 就这样，把你的权利都用上.

183
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:44,572
Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

184
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:46,327
Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...

185
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:47,867
What do you think you're doing in here?
你觉得你在干什么?

186
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:49,470
Listen, listen...

187
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,904
Who gave you permission?
谁给你的权限?

188
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,346
Read this! Aloud!
读读这个! 大声读!

189
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:56,379
Accord every access.
授予所有权限.

190
00:17:56,732 --> 00:18:02,005
Exactly! It doesn't say 'except your laboratory' anywhere,
does it? Unless it's in micro-print.
正确! 它并没说＂除了你的实验室＂，是吧? 除非使用小号字印的.

191
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:03,775
I should have been asked first!
我应该先问问的!

192
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,221
Where is the third Dalek?
第三个 Dalek 哪里去了?

193
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:07,776
I don't know what you're talking about!
我不知道你在说什么!

194
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:13,454
You opened up the capsule without permission.
You found the inner compartment containing three Daleks
你没经过允许就打开了舱体. 你发现了隔间里有三个 Daleks

194
00:18:13,028 --> 00:18:15,454
You took one of them away and you hid it!
你弄走了一个，藏了起来!

195
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:18,397
Hid it? What... what nonsense!
藏起来? 简直... 胡说八道!

196
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:20,209
May I ask what all this is about?
我能问问这是怎么回事吗?

197
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:25,613
We opened an inner compartment in the capsule,
and Lesterson had already been in there.
我们打开舱体里面的隔间时，Lesterson 早就进去过了.

198
00:18:25,865 --> 00:18:27,088
I don't deny that.
我不否认这个.

199
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,333
And he's nicked a Dalek!
他偷了一个 Dalek!

200
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:29,371
Dalek?

201
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:33,749
It's the name the Examiner has given to two metal creations
that I've discovered inside the capsule.
这是监察员给这个两个金属生物起的名字，我在舱体里面发现的那两个生物.

202
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:35,170
And they're dangerous. Evil.
他们很危险，很邪恶.

203
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:37,820
Lumps of metal! Quite inactive.
金属肿块而已! 非常不活跃.

204
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:40,722
That's what you think, mate. If you'd seen...
那是你的想法，伙计．如果你看过...

205
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:47,267
I consider it's my duty as a scientist to...
to examine and investigate these objects.
我想这是我作为一个科学家的指责，检查和调查这些东西．

205
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:52,767
Now please, all of you, keep out of my laboratory.
Keep your hands off my experiments!
现在请离开我的实验室，你们全部．别想染指我的实验!

206
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:58,345
Those 'lumps of metal' - Daleks - I want them broken up,
or melted down. Up, or down, I don't care which, but destroyed!
那些＂金属肿块＂ - Daleks - 我期望他们坏掉，溶掉．我不关心什么方法，但要毁掉．

207
00:18:58,518 --> 00:18:59,717
I refuse to allow it.
我拒绝．

208
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:05,196
I'm an Earth Examiner - I demand it.
我是地球监察员 - 我要求这样.

209
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:06,806
You're exceeding your authority.
这已经超过你的授权范围了.

210
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:10,605
Perhaps we should ask the Governor about that?
I wish to see him immediately!
或许我们该问问总督的意见？我要马上见他!

211
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,869
That might be difficult.
那可能比较困难.

212
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,754
But not impossible. Ben, Polly.
但不是不可能. Ben, Polly.

213
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:21,403
Could he stop the experiments?
他能够停掉这些实验不?

214
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:27,112
I don't know. It's none of your business.
You go and get Janley and then come back here.
我不知道. 这不关你们的事. 你去把 Janley 叫过来.

214
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:31,112
We haven't... haven't got any time to waste.
Now go on man, quickly, quickly!
我们没有... 没有时间浪费. 去吧，快，快!

215
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:59,041
I'd advise a little discretion in your investigations.
It's not a very good time, just now.
但我建议你调查的时候慎重一下. 现在不是一个好的时间点.

216
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:00,663
With all these disturbances...
当前这些风风雨雨...

217
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:01,630
Disturbances?
风风雨雨?

218
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:08,735
Yes, minor acts of sabotage, rebel cliques, secret newspapers,
nothing important you understand, but it keeps the Governor busy.
是的, 一些小的破坏活动, 结党叛乱, 秘密报纸, 没什么太重要的. 但也让总督闲不下来

218
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:12,935
I have no doubt he'll tell you about it himself
when I arrange your meeting with him.
我毫不怀疑他会自己跟你说的, 我安排一下你们的会见．

219
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:14,113
When will that be?
打算在什么时候?

220
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:20,251
Ah, he's going on a tour of the perimeter of the colony.
I'll... I'll find out if he can see you before he goes.
啊, 他先要对基地全面巡视一下... 我看看他去之前能不能见你一下.

221
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,621
Thank you.
谢谢你.

222
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:38,382
Ah, it's a...
啊, 这是个...

223
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:53,382
He won't stop me experimenting. There must be some way
]to bring you back to life - and I'm going to find it.
他可阻止不了我实验．一定有什么方法让你活过来 - 我要找到方法.

224
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:55,605
Here, I bet old Charlie Bragen did it!
我打赌是那个老Charlie Bragen 干得!

225
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:56,433
Charlie?
是叫 Charlie 吗?

226
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:58,048
Well Fred wouldn't suit him would it?
但是 Fred 这个名字不太适合他啊，是吧?

227
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:02,029
If he did do it, do you think it was his own idea?
I mean - he could have been under orders.
如果他没做过，你觉得那是他自己的想法吗? 我是说 - 他可能是收到了命令.

228
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:05,354
You mean from the Governor? Ah, I don't know.
What do you think, Doctor?
你说可能来自总督? 啊, 我不知道. 你怎么想，博士?

229
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:10,001
Oh, yes. Yes of course. Let's... let's consider this button for a moment.
哦，是的. 当然. 我们... 我们先来看一下这个纽扣.

229
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:15,601
It's the only clue we've got to the murderer of the Examiner.
The real Examiner.
这是我们手上关于监察员被害的唯一线索，那个真监察员.

230
00:21:15,936 --> 00:21:18,401
Hmm. And who asked for him to come?
唔. 谁要求他来这里的?

231
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:21,618
Hmm. Well, Lesterson's crackers about that capsule.
He wouldn't want anyone nosing about.
Lesterson对于那个舱体的疯狂举动. 他不想让任何人打听.

232
00:21:21,874 --> 00:21:24,002
Bragen said the Governor's been having trouble.
Bragen 说总督那边一直麻烦缠身.

233
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:26,344
Naw, rule him out. Governors are all the same, he wouldn't ask for help.
好，先排除他. 总督都是一样的，他不会请求援助.

233
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:29,344
If he sent the word it would look as if he couldn't do the job properly.
如果他发这样的信息，会让他看起来不能正确自己处理.

234
00:21:29,613 --> 00:21:30,354
Yes.
是的

235
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,522
Oh, well, I vote we go back to the TARDIS,
I've had enough of this dump.
我建议先回到 TARDIS, 我有点受够了.

236
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:38,209
Have you? What about the Daleks?
是吗? Daleks 怎么办?

237
00:21:38,482 --> 00:21:39,572
Well, they're dead.
他们是死的.

238
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,796
Well, what about that thing we saw in the capsule
- that was alive all right.
我们在舱体里面看到的那个东西是怎么一回事 - 那可是活的.

239
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:44,880
Well, can't explain that.
没法解释那个.

240
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:49,695
I can. And that's why we have to stay!
我能. 而且那就是为什么我们还不能走!

241
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:56,374
Ugly-looking brutes aren't they?
Hey, what's he want to muck about with them for?
他们很丑陋的畜生是吧? 嘿, 他到底瞎倒腾这些干什么呢?

241
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:58,374
Leave well alone, that's what I say.
别管这个了, 要我说.

242
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:04,307
You're a fine one to be a research assistant. Leave well alone?
There'll be no progress on this planet with people like you around.
你就适合做个助手．别理这个? 如果这个星球上都是你这样的人, 我们不会有任何进展.

243
00:22:04,517 --> 00:22:09,942
We're doing all right as we are. Or we were until your lot
came along stirring things up. You won't get away with it, you know.
我们现在就要干这个, 否则你们这些家伙就会把事情搅乱. 你们跑不掉, 你知道的.

243
00:22:10,117 --> 00:22:13,942
The Governor knows all about you rebels.
He'll smash the lot of you when he's ready.
总督对于你们叛乱的事情全知道, 当他准备好之后会碾碎你们.

244
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:15,098
Governor?
总督?

245
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:16,202
Yeah, the Governor!
对, 总督!

246
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,071
He couldn't smash...
他不可能碾碎...

247
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:24,254
Will you be quiet! Where do you both think you are?
This is a scientific laboratory. Kindly keep your politics out of it.
能不能安静一下! 你们俩以为自己是谁? 这是间科学实验室，请别把政治带进来.

247
00:22:24,494 --> 00:22:29,054
Come on, Resno. Man, get on with it. We haven't got all day.
快点, Resno. 伙计, 动起来. 我们没有那么多时间.

247
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:37,654
We've got to get this working before the Examiner stops us.
He's got some phobia about these.. these Daleks?
我们得在总督阻止我们之前搞定这个. 他有点害怕这些东西.. 这些 Daleks?

248
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:41,643
I know the misery they cause - the destruction.

249
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:46,912
Well? Where is the Governor? What did he say?
总督在哪儿? 他说了什么?
哦?

250
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:52,048
He sends his apologies Examiner. He can't see you tonight,
but he hopes to see you first thing in the morning.
他传达了歉意, 监察员．他今晚不能见你, 但期望明早第一个见你.

251
00:22:52,262 --> 00:22:55,574
Well, it might not wait that long, Char... ah, Bragen.
哦, 但也许不用等那么久, Charl ... 哦, Bragen.

252
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:56,909
It will have to.
还真早不了.

253
00:22:57,225 --> 00:22:58,092
Excuse me.
抱歉.

254
00:22:58,192 --> 00:22:58,815
Where are you going?
你要去哪儿?

255
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:00,181
To see the Governor, of course.
当然是去见总督.

256
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:06,498
I'm afraid that's not possible. Once his door is closed, no-one,
not even you, Examiner, is allowed into his room!
恐怕不可能．一旦他的门关上了, 没有人, 即便是你监察员, 也不允许进入他的房间!

257
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:11,098
Very well.
好吧.
很-好.

258
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:14,163
Thank you. Until the morning then.
谢谢. 那就明早吧.

259
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:18,346
What happens now?
这里发生了什么?

260
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:24,153
I shall radio Earth. I'll get Earth to back me.

261
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:26,727
Connecting now.
开始连接.

262
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:31,223
All connections responding.
所有连接正常.
所有连接正常.

263
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:33,441
Nothing at all?
完全没反应?

264
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:34,407
No.

265
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:39,395
It's moving!
开始动了!

266
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:49,772
Now, note this, Janley. Number one attachment with sucker
stick responding. Number two attachment not moving.
现在记下来, Janley. 一号附着物吸盘有反应. 二号附着物没动.

266
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:56,772
Number three attachment with lens responding.
Watch these meters, Resno.
三号附着物镜头有反应. 看看这些读数, Resno.

267
00:23:57,025 --> 00:23:57,841
Still responding.
还有反应.

268
00:23:58,114 --> 00:24:03,800
Now, it's reasonable to assume that this the sucker stick
acts like some kind of a hand.
现在, 有理由假定这个有吸盘的棍子有着手一样的功能.

269
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:09,197
It's all right - don't be alarmed.
We've only introduced temporary power.
没事 - 别大惊小怪. 我们只给了临时的能量.

269
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:14,197
We shall have to be able to open it up
before we could find how it works permanently.
我们得打开它才能彻底搞明白它是怎么工作的.

270
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:15,746
It's a bit frightening.
这东西有一点吓人.

271
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:21,856
Yes. Now, I cannot think what this short stubby arm is for.
是的. 现在我没法想出这个短臂是干什么的.

272
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:23,821
Could the lens attachment be an eye?
这些镜头会是眼睛吗?

273
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:33,407
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now it's quite possible that this, ah, Dalek...
Now there must be some kind of directing influence.
是的, 是的. 很有可能是． 啊, 这个叫做Dalek的东西... 肯定有某种directing influence.

273
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:42,407
There may even be a simplified brain. Positronic,
I shouldn't wonder. If only we could open it up!
这里甚至可能有一个简化的大脑. 正电子的, 我不会奇怪的. 要是我们能打开它就好了!

274
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:45,988
Now what?
现在怎么办?

275
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,544
Everything functioning here.
所有都可以工作了.

276
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:51,935
Yes. Well, perhaps the power is leaking away somewhere.
We'll... we'll try again.
是的, 也许某个地方有能量泄露. 我们再试试.

277
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,828
Look at the eye-stick!
看它的眼睛!

278
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:19,037
It's watching us!
它在看我们!

279
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:20,302
Don't be absurd.
荒谬.

280
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:21,443
It was. I saw it!
真的. 我看见了!

281
00:25:21,684 --> 00:25:27,921
You can't use the phrase 'watching us'. You'll have us
believing that th... the thing has intelligence next.
你不能说＂在看我们＂. 你这样会让我们觉得... 这东西好像有智力似的.

281
00:25:28,184 --> 00:25:29,721
Now, get on with your work, man!
继续干活去吧!

282
00:26:00,523 --> 00:26:01,209
I know you're there.
我就知道你在这里.

283
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,409
Examiner, thank goodness, it's you.
I've been trying to talk to you ever since you got here.
监察员, 谢天谢地, 是你啊. 你一到这里我就想来跟你谈谈.

284
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:10,108
What's happening here? You again.
这里发生了什么? 又是你.

285
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:11,350
What do you want?
你想要什么?
你想干什么?
你想要干什么?

286
00:26:11,556 --> 00:26:13,322
I found the operator unconscious.
我发现操作员没知觉了.

287
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:18,623
So did I! I was just looking at him, when I heard
someone move. It must have been you.
我也发现了! 我正看着他, 就听见有谁在走动了. 肯定是你.

288
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:20,338
And those?
那些是...?

289
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:23,922
I picked them up. What is all this?
我刚捡起来的. 这都是怎么了?

290
00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:25,635
The cables have been cut.
这些线缆被剪断了.

291
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:31,875
This is serious. It's not just our own communications.
We're cut off from Earth as well.
这很严重. 不仅仅是内部通讯出了问题了，我们跟地球的联系也被切断了.

292
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:33,609
The only people who'd want to do that are the rebels.
想干这个的只能是那些叛乱分子.

293
00:26:33,864 --> 00:26:36,596
Those muscle boys of yours had any brains,
they'd stop things like this.
你的那些四肢发达的小伙子要是有点脑子的话, 就能防止这些事情发生了.

294
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:41,681
And you say you picked these up? I suggest that
you were sabotaging the communications...
你说这个东西是你捡到的? 我觉得破坏通讯的也是你...

295
00:26:41,921 --> 00:26:42,496
That's a lie!
那是瞎说!

296
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:46,133
...having first attacked one of the engineers.
I'd detain the Governor on evidence like that.
...还攻击了其中一个工程师. 有这些证据，我得让总督过一会儿再走.

297
00:26:46,414 --> 00:26:48,652
I hope you're not thinking of detaining me, Bragen.
我期望你没打算让我过一会儿再走, Bragen.

298
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:52,490
I've no option. I could hardly let you run around loose after this, could I?
我没得选. 发生了这样的事, 我不可能再让你乱跑, 是吧?

299
00:26:53,024 --> 00:26:56,781
All right - you win this round, Bragen.
We'll see what it looks like in front of the Governor.
好吧 - 这轮你赢了. 我们看看到了总督面前怎么说.

300
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,897
All connections responding.
所有连接正常.

301
00:27:00,193 --> 00:27:00,760
Excellent.
很好.

302
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:01,739
It's working!
行了!

303
00:27:01,957 --> 00:27:07,947
Excellent. Film it, film it now, Resno.
And, note the readings, Janley.
很好. 录下来, 现在就录, Resno. 对了, 记一下数据, Janley.

304
00:27:11,592 --> 00:27:13,260
It seems to be interested in you, Resno.
看来它对你有兴趣, Resno.

305
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:16,245
What's the matter with you man?
你是怎么回事?

306
00:27:16,895 --> 00:27:21,255
I tell you it's intelligent. It's watching me, Lesterson.
Weighing me up! I can sense it!
我告诉你它是有智能的. 他在看着我, Lesterson. 在打量我! 我能感觉到!

307
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:22,400
Don't be a fool.
别傻了.

308
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,574
I don't like it I tell you.
I don't know what these things can do.
我不喜欢这样, 我跟你说．我不知道这些东西能做出什么事情来．

309
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:30,566
No, and we never shall know, shall we, unless we take film
of every reaction. Now get on with your work, man!
不, 我们永远不可能知道, 除非我们把它的每一个反应都拍下来. 继续你的工作, 伙计!

310
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:41,153
Resno!

311
00:27:47,956 --> 00:27:48,864
It's all right. He isn't dead.
没事．他没死.

312
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:49,925
What happened?
发生了什么?

313
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:51,516
Knocked out by the shock waves.
被冲击波震晕了.

314
00:27:53,616 --> 00:27:56,378
We must get him to the hospital. I'll go and get help.
我们必须带他去医院, 我去叫人来帮忙.

315
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:22,189
But we've got to defend Quinn.
我们要帮 Quinn 作证

316
00:28:22,582 --> 00:28:25,401
Yeah, I know. He's innocent until he's proved guilty. But he is guilty.
是的,  我知道． 他是无辜的,  至少在证明他有罪之前．但他有罪.

317
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:27,006
He's the Deputy Governor!
他是副总督!

318
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:33,978
So what? I had a headmaster once who got nicked for not paying his bus fare!
And then there's the motive, don't forget the motive.
那又怎样? 我那会儿有个小头目被撸下来, 就只因为没交公交车费! 而且他这还是有动机的, 别忘了动机.

319
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:35,346
Like what for instance?
比如说是什么?

320
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:39,165
Well, he's the Deputy Governor, right? Maybe he wants to be Governor.
首先, 他是副总督, 对吧? 也许他想当总督.

321
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:40,817
Oh, that's ridiculous!
哦, 这太荒谬了!

322
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,374
Well, the jacket button wasn't! And he was caught red-handed
in the Communications Room with a pair of pliers
那, 外衣纽扣总不荒谬吧! 而且他在通讯室里面被抓住时手里正拿着一把钳子

322
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,374
And don't tell me he was plucking his eye-brows either.
别跟我说他是拿那东西来剪眉毛的.

323
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:51,167
Look, there are some people you know are all right.
You just know by looking at them.
有些人你知道他们是没有问题的，你看见他们的样子就知道.

324
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,541
Good morning. The enquiry is about to begin.
I've been sent to escort you.
早上好. 质询马上要开始. 我被派来带你们过去.

我很抱歉没能早点见你，监察员。请坐。

325
00:28:05,595 --> 00:29:14,051
Well, Quinn, I don't like this anymore than you do.
What have you been up to?
Quinn, 我跟你一样不喜欢这个. 你都做什么了?

326
00:29:14,443 --> 00:29:16,036
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
什么也没有做.

327
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:20,220
Well, what about Bragen's report then? These are facts, Quinn.
Now, what have you got to say about it?
那， Bragen 的报告是怎么回事? 这些是事实证据, Quinn. 现在，你还有什么要说的?

328
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,417
Does the engineer say I hit him?
那个工程师说是我打了他?

329
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:23,967
How could he if he was hit from behind?
他是被人从后面袭击的，他能怎么说?

330
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:25,333
Then its only circumstantial evidence.
那就只有间接证据了.

331
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:31,289
The Examiner was also attacked in the mercury swamp.
We have a button from your jacket, found in the Examiner's hand.
监察员也在水银沼泽被人袭击了。这里有一颗你衣服上的纽扣，是在监察员手里找到的.

332
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:33,487
I can't explain that.
这个我没法解释.

333
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,748
I'm sure you can't!
我肯定你没法!

334
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,065
Examiner.

335
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:41,236
You mentioned to Bragen that these machines of Lesterson's...
What do you call them?
你向 Bragen 提及了 Lesterson 发现的那些机器... 你管他们叫什么来着?

336
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:43,298
I call them what they are - Daleks.
他们本来的名字 - Daleks

337
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:48,047
Ah, yes, yes, yes, Daleks. You say they could be a motive
for destroying our communications.

00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,109
I do.

339
00:29:49,473 --> 00:29:51,725
Lesterson, this is a special enquiry. Now please.

This won't wait. You won't be disappointed!

You heard what I said Lesterson!
你听到我说什么了 Lesterson!
Lesterson!
Lesterson!

342

Governor, I've just completed a... an experiment
which could revolutionise the whole colony. Bear with me.
总督，我已经完成了一项实验，可给基地带来革命. 听我多说两句.

343
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,929
Lesterson, what have you done? What have you done?
Lesterson, 你完成什么了？你完成什么了?

344
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:05,584
I'll show you. Janley, now!
我给你演示一下. Janley, 开始!

345
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:44,100
It recognised the Doctor. It recognised him.

346
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:46,342
What's the matter, Doctor? Are you all right?
你怎么啦，博士? 有什么不舒服吗?

347
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,882
The fools. The stupid fools.
蠢人. 愚蠢之极.

348
00:30:50,294 --> 00:30:52,902
You're scared! What can it do?
你害怕啦! 它能干什么?

349
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,531
Nothing yet.
目前还没有.

350
00:30:54,904 --> 00:30:58,314
It knew who you were! It sounds crazy, but it did.

351
00:30:58,574 --> 00:30:59,415
Knew who I was.
知道我过去是谁.

352
00:31:00,745 --> 00:31:02,082
The Dalek knows who you are.
Dalek 知道你现在是谁.

353
00:31:02,543 --> 00:31:04,287
This creation is called, I understand, a Dalek. 
这个生物叫做, 按我的理解, 叫做 Dalek. 现在看看

353
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:07,887
Now, look at it. I have merely given it electrical power.
But it is capable of storing it.)
现在看着, 我只不过给了一点电力, 但它能够储存它．FIXME

354
00:31:07,423 --> 00:31:17,957
Moreover, it responds to orders. Turn around. Move that chair.
它还能对命令做出响应. 转一圈. 移动那个椅子.

355
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:32,380
Stop. You see? Well, just think what this could do for our...
our mining program, our processing, packaging.
停. 看见了吧. 想想这能给我们的挖矿, 流水线, 打包工作带来什么.

355
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:38,380
Dozens of labour jobs, Governor.
It may even supply the end to all this Colony's problems.
无数的劳工啊, 总督. 它甚至可以终结这个基地的所有问题.

356
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:43,250
Yes, it will end the colony's problems, because it will end the colony!
是的, 它可以终结这个基地的所有问题, 因为它可以终结这个基地!

357
00:31:43,714 --> 00:31:48,249
I am your servant.
我-是-你的-仆人.

358
00:31:49,423 --> 00:31:56,144
It... it spoke! Janley, did you hear it? It can actually talk!
它... 它说话了! Janley, 你听到了吗? 它真的会说话!

359
00:31:56,482 --> 00:32:12,888
It can do many things, Lesterson.
But the thing it does most efficiently is exterminate human beings.
It destroys them, without mercy, without conscience.
It destroys them. Utterly. Completely. It destroys them.
它能做很多事情, Lesterson. 但它干得最有效率的事情是终结人的生命.

360
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:18,081
I am your servant. I am your servant....

361
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:17,098
I am your servant. I am your servant....

362
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:21,318
So Lesterson, they're even capable of speech!
Lesterson, 它们居然可以说话!

363
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,670
Yes. But then, why not? After all, they have a certain intelligence.
是的. 为什么不呢? 毕竟, 他们有一定的智力.

364
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:27,735
Yes I know, but...
是的我知道, 但是...

365
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,541
But is... is it... it is... an intelligence that we can control.
但是, 是不是... 我们可以控制住.

366
00:32:31,932 --> 00:32:34,922
So what you want is permission to continue your experiments?
你想的无非就是获准可以继续你的实验?

367
00:32:35,157 --> 00:32:39,900
Governor, think what it would mean if we were to set it to work in the mines. It could double our production overnight!
总督, 想想这意味着什么, 我们可以让他们去挖矿. 我们的生产力可以翻番了!

368
00:32:40,112 --> 00:32:42,095
Consider the effects it could have on our whole economy.
想想这可能给我们整体经济带来什么效果.

369
00:32:42,376 --> 00:32:49,457
Yes, and the effect of that on Earth... Yes. Yes, they could be very grateful.
是的, 还可以地球地球带来... 是的, 是的, 他们会很感激的.

370
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:53,278
I shall stop you. I will!
我该阻止你. 我会的!

371
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:55,905
All right Lesterson, permission granted.
好了 Lesterson, 授权你可以继续.

372
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,255
Permission? Permission for what?
授权? 授什么权?

373
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,261
To continue my work, Examiner.
继续我的工作啊, 监察员.

374
00:33:01,908 --> 00:33:05,803
But... But didn't you all hear what I said? The Daleks must be destroyed!
但是... 但是你没听见我说什么了吗? Daleks必须全部毁掉!

375
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,095
Ho, ho. Never!
吼, 吼. 绝不!

376
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:12,597
Very well. If not by my order - then by Earth's! Come Ben, Polly.
很好. 如果我的命令不好使 - 那地球的命令总可以了! 过来 Ben, Polly.

377
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:15,483
You're my servant, are you?
你是我的仆人, 是吗?

378
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,886
I... I am.
我... 是.

379
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:33,070
Very well. Immobilise yourself. Go on. I order it! Immediately!
很好. 关掉你自己. 快. 我命令! 马上!
继续.

380
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:38,620
Huh!
哈!

381
00:33:42,428 --> 00:33:43,527
Lesterson.

382
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,326
Why did you stop obeying? You were given an order.
你为什么不遵守? 你已经收到命令了.

383
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:50,550
He has gone.
他-已经-走了.

384
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:52,398
Then you obey only...
你只遵守...

385
00:33:52,597 --> 00:34:06,856
His order was wrong. I cannot serve human beings if I am immobilised. You gave me power. Your orders are right. I serve you.
他的-命令-是-错误的. 我-要是-关掉-自己-就-不能-服务于-人了.FIXME
你-给了-我-能量. 你的-命令-是-对的. 我-服务于-你.

386
00:34:06,982 --> 00:34:11,309
Lesterson. Lesterson, it reasons. Just how limited is its intelligence?
Lesterson. Lesterson, 他会分析. 你不是说它智力有限吗?

387
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:22,494
Now, there is no cause for... for concern, Governor. Just you wait until you see the amount of work it can do! And now, I'm really going to put you through your paces. Follow me, Dalek.
喔, 没理由担心这个, 总督. 你等着瞧它能做多少事情!
现在, 我要让你经历你自己的生活了. 跟我来, Dalek.

388
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:24,755
I obey.
我-服从.
我-服从
我-服从.
我-服从
我-服从
我-服从.

389
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:36,658
Excellent. excellent.
非常好. 非常好.

390
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,767
But I thought we were after the Daleks, not this control unit you've nicked!
我还以为我们在追查的是 Daleks, 而不是你在玩弄的这个控制盒!

391
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,878
Ah, yes!

392
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:48,127
He's a right little delinquent, isn't he?
他对这事不怎么上心, 是不?

393
00:34:48,412 --> 00:34:50,657
Doctor, what on Earth are you up to?
博士, 你到底在干什么?

394
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:52,423
Ooh!
哦!

395
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:55,926
Ah! Now we're really getting somewhere!
啊! 我们真有点进展了!

396
00:34:57,773 --> 00:35:01,109
Now, the Examiner was attacked, there can be no question of that.

397
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,916
And the button grabbed by the Examiner was missing from your suit.
被监察员抓到手的纽扣也是你衣服上不见的那个.

398
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:06,598
Yes, if you've got anything to add to that, you'd better say it now.
是的, 如果你还有什么补充, 你最好现在就说.

399
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:11,091
I didn't attack the man. I had no reason to. I was the one that sent for him!
我没有袭击他. 我没有理由. 他是我请求派来的!

400
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:13,921
You sent for him?!
你请求的?!

401
00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:19,216
It was necessary. Under the circumstances, I'd hardly be likely to sabotage the radio communications.
在现在这情况下, 必须这样做。我也不可能破坏电波通讯.

402
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,740
But... but why Quinn? Why?
不过... 为什么 Quinn? 为什么?
为什么?

403
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:23,225
Because of the rebels!
因为那些叛乱分子!

404
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:25,952
The rebels! They're nothing more than one or two fanatics.
叛乱分子! 只不过有一两个狂热分子.

405
00:35:26,185 --> 00:35:27,156
You know as well as I do that they...
你我都知道他们...

406
00:35:27,414 --> 00:35:31,372
Unless you're trying to create trouble here - to undermine the Governor's position.
除非你是想制造些事端 - 想挖总督的墙脚吧.

407
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:34,966
Bragen, you'd better explain that.
Bragen, 你最好解释一下.

408
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:42,380
If you're removed, who takes your place? The Deputy Governor, of course. And that's the real reason behind all this trouble, isn't it Quinn?
如果你被除掉了, 谁顶你的位子? 当然是副总督. 这就是所有问题的真正原因, 对吧 Quinn?

409
00:35:42,655 --> 00:35:43,226
Go on.

410
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:49,013
You attack the Examiner in the mercury swamp and blame it on the rebels. Then you sabotage the radio - blame that on the rebels too.
你在水银沼泽袭击了监察员, 嫁祸于叛乱分子. 然后又破坏了电台 - 也归咎于叛乱分子.

411
00:35:50,142 --> 00:35:51,552
Get him out of my sight!
把他带走!

412
00:35:51,877 --> 00:35:54,664
Hensell, before you listen to these preposterous allegations...
Hensell, 在你听取这些荒谬的指控之前...

413
00:36:01,138 --> 00:36:08,167
I chose Quinn myself. I trained him for the job. Why, in a few years time, he'd have had this seat!
Quinn 是我自己选的. 我培养他干这个工作. 为什么啊, 要不了几年时间, 他就能坐在这个位子上了啊!

414
00:36:08,495 --> 00:36:11,527
Sometimes Governor, a few years is a long time to wait.
总督, 有时候, 几年时间也嫌太长, 等不了啊.

415
00:36:15,678 --> 00:36:16,597
Oh, Bragen?
哦, Bragen?

416
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,731
Governor?

417
00:36:19,169 --> 00:36:25,373
You will assume Quinn's duties. As of now, you are Deputy Governor.
你接替 Quinn 的工作. 目前来说, 你是副总督.

418
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,381
Look Doctor, I don't want to appear dim, but how's this going to do the Daleks in?
看着, 博士, 我并不想看起来比较负能量, 但这跟 Daleks 有什么关系?

419
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:39,397
They think that Lesterson's the driving force, but I don't. The Daleks are using him.
他们认为是 Lesterson 有主导权, 但我觉得不是. Daleks 在利用他.

420
00:36:39,757 --> 00:36:40,631
But how?
那怎么办?

421
00:36:40,872 --> 00:36:49,913
Problem. Smash the Daleks, and the people here will lock us up or kill us. Let the Daleks go, and we'll all be exterminated.
有个问题. 砸碎 Daleks 的话, 这里的人会把我们锁起来或者干脆干掉我们 FIXME
任由 Daleks 乱来的话, 我们会被 exterminated（终结）.

422
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:53,644
We could just go back to the TARDIS. At least we'd be safe to think there.
我们可以回 TARDIS 去. 至少在那里是安全的.

423
00:36:54,062 --> 00:36:55,589
Oh yes, that's coming on.
哦, 是的, that's coming on.

424
00:36:55,705 --> 00:36:57,556
Oh, you talk to him, will you?
哦, 你会跟他说的, 是吗?

425
00:36:57,794 --> 00:37:00,704
Doctor look, if you told us what you were up to, perhaps we could help you.
博士, 如果你告诉我们你要干什么的话, 也许我们能帮上忙.

426
00:37:01,183 --> 00:37:11,349
Mustn't underestimate any of them. Lesterson's a first class scientist, first class. He opened the capsule. He realised that the Daleks could be reactivated.
千万不能低估他们中的任何一个. Lesterson 是个一流的科学家, 一流的FIXME
他打开了舱体, 还发现 Daleks 可以被重新激活.

427
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:19,947
Yeah, that could be the answer. Let's kidnap Lesterson, and hide him away for a bit. Well, it would stop him bringing the Daleks back to life, wouldn't it?
是, 那可能就是答案. 我们不如把 Lesterson 绑架了吧, 把他藏起来一阵子 FIXME
这样就可以阻止他救活那些 Daleks, 对吧?

428
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:22,461
I thought it was pretty bright.
我觉得这个主意真不错.

429
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:23,834
There we are.
这下可以了.

430
00:37:24,474 --> 00:37:25,491
What is it?
什么?
什么事?
这是什么?

431
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:33,371
What is it? It could be the answer to all our problems.
这是什么东西? 可能是我们所有问题的答案.

432
00:37:34,327 --> 00:37:38,022
Incredible! Well, let's move on to test fourteen.
难以置信! 好, 下面我们进行第14项测试.

433
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:40,009
I am ready.
我-准备-好了.

434
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:45,516
When sodium acts on ethyl alcohol, what is the resulting derivative?
把钠与酒精掺在一起, 会产生什么后果?

435
00:37:46,026 --> 00:37:52,019
Sodium ethoxide. C2 H5 ONa.

436
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:56,866
Just five seconds, Janley! Just the time it took to speak the answer.
只需要5秒, Janley! 而且这点时间都用来念答案了.

437
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,894
Right too.
又答对了.

438
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:07,823
But of course it's right! Look, can you imagine what kind of positronic brain this robot has, Janley? Think of the store of knowledge that it must carry.
当然是对的! 你能想象这个机器人用的是哪种正子脑吗, Janley?

439
00:38:07,977 --> 00:38:08,695
May I come in?
我可以进来吗?

440
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:09,883
What do you want?

441
00:38:10,113 --> 00:38:12,451
Oh, ah, just to see how you're getting on.
哦, 只是来看看你这里进展如何.

442
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:13,395
If you think...
如果你想要...

443
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:18,303
No, please! I'm... I'm not here to cause trouble. I... I'm just interested, that's all.
不, 别这样! 我... 不是来找麻烦的. ... 我只是很有兴趣, 仅此而已.

444
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:21,262
You've done nothing but meddle and interfere ever since you landed on Vulcan.
自你达到 Vulcan 以来, 除了干扰和干涉之外什么也没做过.

445
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:27,607
Well, I... I did give you permission to open up the capsule, now didn't I? Please, carry on.
这个... 是我给了权限打开舱体, 是吧? 现在请继续.

446
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,177
And you won't try to stop me?
你不打算阻止我?

447
00:38:30,523 --> 00:38:40,599
Stop you? No, of course not. We get off on the wrong foot, Lesterson, but... but I'm a reasonable man and... and I've been thinking, perhaps I was hasty.
阻止你? 不, 当然不. 咱们俩一开始就不怎么对付, Lesterson,
不过... 我是一个讲理的人... 我在想, 也许是我太鲁莽了.

448
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:44,017
Well, if you... if you... if you really want to call a truce.
好吧, 如果... 如果你真想要休战.

449
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:47,524
A truce? My dear fellow, I... I'd like to be friends!
休战? 亲爱的家伙, ... 我期望可以成为朋友!

450
00:38:48,063 --> 00:38:51,969
Yes. Yes. Very well, you may stay.
好. 好. 很好, 你可以呆着.

451
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:54,861
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

452
00:38:56,102 --> 00:39:00,399
Laboratory. Yes.
这里是实验室. 是.

453
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,911
All right, I can come now. Right.
好的, 我可以过来. 好.
好.
好的.

454
00:39:11,122 --> 00:39:14,555
I just have to slip out for a few minutes, Lesterson, alright?
我得出去几分钟, Lesterson, 可以吧?

455
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:19,101
Ah, yes, yes. Um, very well then. Examiner, shall we test its knowledge of physics?
啊, 可以, 可以. 唔, 那么, 监察员, 我们开始测试一下他的物理知识?

456
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:22,451
Oh, oh, splendid, splendid. Ah, huh, please, please, carry on.
哦, 太好了, 啊, 请开始吧.

457
00:39:22,732 --> 00:39:26,551
Thank you. D... what is the First Law of Thermodynamics?
谢谢你... 热力学第一定律是什么?

458
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:51,002
When heat is transformed into any other kind of energy or vice versa, the total quantity of energy remains invariable. That is to say, the quantity of heat which disappears is equivalent to the quantity of other kind of energy produced...
当-热能-转换成-其它-能, 或者-反过来, 能量-总和-保持-不变.
也-就是-说, 消失的-热能-和-新产生的-其它-类型的-能-在量上-是-相同的...

459
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,970
Fool! What do you think you're doing?
笨蛋! 你以为你在干什么?

460
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:55,309
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!...
啊!...

461
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:57,135
I'm saving your life!
我在救你的命!

462
00:39:57,955 --> 00:39:59,308
Get out! Get out!
出去! 出去!

463
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,791
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... I have, ah, sustained no damage.
啊!... 啊!... 啊!... 我-扛住-了, 啊, 没有-受损.
啊!... 啊!... 啊!... 啊!... 啊!... 啊!...

464
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:14,175
You were able to get away then?
你甩开他们了?

465
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:17,209
Yes. Lesterson's with the Examiner. And Hensell?
是的. Lesterson 和监察员在一起. Hensell 呢?

466
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:20,291
At a meeting of production managers. He left me in control.
在和产品经理们开会. 现在我说了算.

467
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:23,209
We could take over the colony now.
现在我们可以接管这个基地了.

468
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:30,004
No. No it has to be absolutely right. I don't want to take over a colony full of rebels do I, Janley?
不. 必须做到万无一失. 我可不想接管一个满是叛乱分子的基地, Janley?

469
00:40:30,244 --> 00:40:32,672
Well, I don't know. You're making me help them.
我也不清楚. 是你让我帮助他们.

470
00:40:32,983 --> 00:40:43,726
Only to stir them up to create enough trouble to get rid of Hensell, and then... and then we crush them. The whole colony will be grateful, and I'll be Governor.
把他们搅乱, 多制造些问题, 就可以把 Hensell 搞下去了. 然后我们再镇压他们.
这样我们就是基地的功臣, 我就是总督了.

471
00:40:46,216 --> 00:40:47,614
Is that the gun you told me of?
这就是你跟我说过的那种枪?

472
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:50,419
Can you persuade the rebels this will help them?
你能说服那些叛乱分子, 说这对他们很有用吗?

473
00:40:50,693 --> 00:40:53,620
Yes, Valmar thinks he can work in a switch to turn it on and off.
是的, Valmar 认为他可以做一个开关.

474
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:55,012
How powerful is it?
这有多厉害?

475
00:40:55,385 --> 00:41:02,161
It killed Resno, Lesterson's assistant, and Lesterson believes that Resno's simply shaken up - taking a few days off.
它杀死了 Resno, Lesterson 的助手. Lesterson 还以为 Resno 只是晕倒了, 需要休息几天而已.

476
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:03,347
And the body?
尸体呢?

477
00:41:03,835 --> 00:41:16,841
In the mercury swamp. Lesterson was the indirect cause of Resno's death. It's a good hold over him if he makes trouble. I'll give this to Valmar then?
扔进水银沼泽了. 其实是 Lesterson 害死了他.
这是个不错的把柄, 不怕他不听话了. 那我把这个交给 Valmar 去了?

478
00:41:16,905 --> 00:41:17,478
Yes.

479
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:19,020
When do we move?

I thought Quinn was the danger.

Uh, not any more. The Examiner is no fool. No, there has to be something else.
哦, 不再是了. 那个监察员不是傻子. 不对, 这里还得搞点事儿.

483
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:37,525
Well?

00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:40,122
Well, he's not in the laboratory, Lesterson's by himself.
他不在实验室里, 只有 Lesterson 一个人.

485
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,839

嗯. 他肯定从别的路走了. 把你一个人留在这里行吗? 我打算回休息室去.

Well, do you know where he is?

Umm...
唔...

00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,456
Oh, you'll find it easy enough. Look. Around, then to your right, in the next block.
哦, 你会发现很简单的.  拐过去, 在你的右手边, 下一个区就是.

Doctor? Anyone here?

哦!
她说了她回这里来的. 她认识路, 也不会乱转, 我知道她不会的. 噢!

I'm talking about Polly.

Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!

505

不不不! 她四处逛逛而已, 这里有好多东西可以看. 她对这些很感兴趣. 我喜欢这一点.

506
00:43:05,439 --> 00:43:05,939
Come on.

Where are we going?

去报告. 如果我们要傻等, 我可不想! 我们去报告!

509
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:20,510

还好. 我总算及时阻止了那个傻蛋监察员.

510
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:23,693
I am your servant.

00:43:28,928 --> 00:43:31,771
What does this machine do?
这台-机器-是做-什么-的?

你看, 很神奇的. 你有着人类一样的兴趣和好奇心.

513
00:43:37,368 --> 00:43:46,953
A Dalek is bet... is not the same as a human. If I am to help, I must know everything.
Dalek-比人类...跟人类-不太-一样. 如果-要我-帮忙, 我得-知道-所有-事情.

514

00:43:50,874 --> 00:43:54,174
It computes meteorite storms as they approach our weather satellites.

00:43:54,522 --> 00:43:56,414
How accurate is it?

518
00:43:56,776 --> 00:44:01,785
About, ah, seventy percent. It helps to cut down on our satellite losses.
大约70％. 它对于降低卫星损失很有帮助.

519
00:44:01,898 --> 00:44:07,602
Daleks can build pu... computers with one hundred percent accuracy.

00:44:07,997 --> 00:44:09,370
One hundred percent?

521
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:16,670
If you provide materials and our own power unit, a computer will be built.
如果-你能-提供-材料, 并给-我们-提供-能量, 计算机-将会-造好.

522
00:44:17,122 --> 00:44:21,703

Then, you will get the materials?

I'll go and speak to the Governor at once.

Huh, huh. Oh, that's marvellous!

00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:08,455
You agreed we'd go and see Bragen.
你同意我们去找 Bragen 的.

528
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:09,893
Hmm? Power.

00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,956
Come on then!
快点啊!

530
00:45:12,557 --> 00:45:14,925
Now the energy intake for Daleks should be the cube...
Daleks 的能量入口应该是那个方块...

531
00:45:16,536 --> 00:45:17,428
Lesterson!

532
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:18,075
Eh?
哦?
嗯?
嗯?
呃?

533
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:21,454
He just went past. That means we can get into his laboratory again.

534
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:22,518
But we're looking for...

00:45:23,085 --> 00:45:24,371
Oh, come along, Ben. Come along.

What are you doing here?

Entry is restricted.
入口-被-禁了.

541
00:45:40,948 --> 00:45:42,156
That is an order.

542
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:45,651
A Dalek order. Short circuit the generator, Ben.
Dalek 的命令. 去把生成器弄短路了, Ben.

00:45:46,028 --> 00:45:51,529
Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Stand back!
啊!... 啊!!... 靠后站!

544
00:45:51,757 --> 00:45:55,675
Don't be frightened of it Ben. It's not armed. I'm going to see what it was doing in there.
别怕它 Ben. 它没有武器了. 我倒要看看他打算在这里做什么.

545
00:46:05,612 --> 00:46:09,887
Ben, let's get out of here!
Ben, 我们快出去!

546
00:46:10,914 --> 00:46:12,877
Fool. Lesterson must have reactivated them.
蠢啊. Lesterson 一定重新激活他们了.

547
00:46:13,085 --> 00:46:17,041
Yes. When I say run, Run!

00:46:23,253 --> 00:46:29,661
I have sent the human being for materials.
我-已经-让人类-去-准备-材料了.

549
00:46:29,903 --> 00:46:31,016
And power?
还有-能量?

550
00:46:31,412 --> 00:46:39,109
Yes. Power we can turn into static, then we will conquer.
是. 我们-能把-能量-转换为-静电, 然后-我们-就可-征服.

551
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:47,525
We will conquer... We will conquer... We will conquer...
我们-将要-征服... 我们-将要-征服... 我们-将要-征服...

552
00:46:47,759 --> 00:46:52,750
But if you didn't do it Lesterson, then the Dalek must have used your power supply and reactivated the others itself.
但是如果不是你干的 Lesterson, 那么 Dalek 肯定是自己用你提供的电源激活了其它几个

553
00:46:52,965 --> 00:46:54,671
I was going to do that anyway.
我正要去激活它们呢.

554
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:57,186
Are you off your head, mate? Those two are armed!
你脑子秀逗了, 伙计? 他们是带武器的!

555
00:46:57,671 --> 00:47:02,056
Then we turn off the electricity, disarm them, and then everything is safe again.
那我们关掉电力供应, 解除他们的武装, 不就万事大吉了.

556
00:47:02,328 --> 00:47:03,506
I've already explained to you.
我已经跟你解释过了.

557
00:47:03,741 --> 00:47:11,192

停止这些争论吧, 你俩都别说了, 我受够了.

But they must be destroyed!
但他们必须被销毁掉!

559
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:19,816
Bragen, I'm making a tour of the perimeter. I put you in direct charge here. See that Lesterson gets everything he wants, will you?
Bragen, 我要下去巡视了, 在此期间这里你说了算
确保 Lesterson 这里想要什么就给他什么, 好吧?

560
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:25,004
I shall need a permanent guard on my laboratory, Bragen.
我实验室还需要一个保安, Bragen.

561
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:31,787
Don't worry about the Examiner. I think I can keep him quiet.
别担心监察员. 我想我能让他保持安静.

562
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:40,716
Greed and ambition, that's all it is. Wait till they find out what their precious production figures have cost them!
贪婪, 野心勃勃, 那就是它们的本性. 等着吧, 看看他们美妙的产品图能带给他们什么代价!

563
00:47:40,951 --> 00:47:42,145
Oh, I want to see you.
哦, 我正要去找你呢.

564

What about?

00:47:44,508 --> 00:47:46,507
Well it's Polly, she's missing. We can't find her anywhere.
是 Polly, 她失踪. 我们在哪儿都找不到她.

566
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:50,470
I'll tell one of my men to make enquiries. It shouldn't take long to find her.

00:47:50,806 --> 00:47:51,624
Ah, thanks.
多谢了.

568
00:47:52,574 --> 00:48:02,461
Examiner, some of my men have found a body in the mercury swamp. It was the body of a middle-aged man.
监察员, 我的几个手下在水银沼泽里发现了一具尸体, 是一个中年人的.

569
00:48:03,074 --> 00:48:04,451
What is that to do with me?
这跟我有什么关系吗?

570
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:08,177
You're the Examiner - or maybe you're not.
你是监察员啊 - 除非你不是.

571
00:48:14,443 --> 00:48:16,440
Just exactly what do you mean by that?
你这么说是什么意思?

572
00:48:17,066 --> 00:48:20,087
Who are you? Quinn's friends? Come to stir up rebellion?
你是谁? Quinn 的朋友? 是来制造骚乱?

573
00:48:20,873 --> 00:48:24,331
There's only one possible way that you could know I'm not the Examiner.
如果你认为我不是监察员, 那只有一种可能.

574
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,526
Yeah, by knowing what the real Examiner looked like!
是的, 那就是知道真正的监察员长什么样!

575
00:48:27,868 --> 00:48:36,394
Exactly, Ben. Exactly! Only two people knew of his arrival on this planet. Myself and his murderer.
很对, Ben. 很对! 只有两个人知道他抵达这个星球时的情形：我和杀他的人.

576
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:37,724
That's enough!
够了!

577
00:48:38,017 --> 00:48:40,304
Is it? Doctor, we've got to tell the Governor.
是这样? 博士, 我们去告诉总督.

578
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:46,999
Do you think he'll believe you? I'll soon convince him that you murdered the man yourself. You stole the Examiner's badge.
你觉得他会相信你? 我很快就可以让他相信是你杀了那个人, 还偷了那个人的徽章.

579
00:48:48,107 --> 00:48:54,577
Then why don't you arrest us? Because there's a doubt isn't there? Because it might, it just might, go against you.
那你为什么不逮捕我们? 因为这里还有疑问, 对不? 因为有可能不往你想的方向发展.

580
00:48:54,867 --> 00:49:02,653
All right, all right, so neither of us wants to make a move. But you leave Lesterson alone - and the Daleks!
好吧, 好吧, 我们谁也不想先动. 但你们离 Lesterson 远点 - 还有 Daleks!

581
00:49:09,156 --> 00:49:11,356
He'd make a right Father Christmas, wouldn't he?
他要做一个圣诞老人, 对不

582
00:49:11,605 --> 00:49:15,402
Oh, I'd rather fight a hundred of his sort than just one Dalek.
哦, 我宁可跟一百个他这种人斗, 也不想碰到一个 Dalek.

583
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,042
Listen to this. "The girl is safe. She will remain so as long as you leave the Daleks alone".
听听. "女孩儿很安全. 只要你们远离 Daleks, 她就是安全的".

584
00:49:34,461 --> 00:49:36,585
And did you disarm the other two?
你解除了另外两个的武器?

585
00:49:37,136 --> 00:49:43,036
Yes. We are your servants. We do not need guns.

是的-我们-是-你们的-仆人.

I'm very glad. I knew the Examiner was wrong about you.

587
00:49:47,387 --> 00:49:49,435
Did you get our materials?

588
00:49:49,731 --> 00:49:52,251
Yes. Everything you need you can have.
是的. 你们想要什么都行.

589
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,848
And a power plant?
还有-一个-电厂?

590
00:49:54,921 --> 00:49:56,007
Everything.
都行.

591
00:50:05,384 --> 00:50:08,722
We will get our power.

592
00:50:09,156 --> 00:50:18,423
We will get our power. We will get our power. We will get our power. We will...
593
00:50:27,043 --> 00:50:33,224
Turn back the power supply.

593
00:50:33,496 --> 00:50:38,024
I will, I will. But I want you to remember that I control you.
我会的，但我要你们记住，是我控制你们

594
00:50:38,522 --> 00:50:43,478
We are your servants.

595
00:50:43,871 --> 00:50:56,846
I know. Remember it. I gave you each a special charge to bring you back to life. Any further power you need must come from this generator. And I control it. Is that clear?
我知道，记住这点：我给了你们每个充了电，这才让你们复活了
你们还需要电力的话，都得靠这个发电机来. 由我来控制它，明白了吗?

596
00:50:57,163 --> 00:50:59,659
We obey.
我们-服从

597
00:51:12,348 --> 00:51:13,659

To await your orders, master.

It is ready.
已经-好了

Isn't that finished yet?
还没完成吗?

00:51:54,026 --> 00:51:54,901
Nearly.
快了

605
00:51:55,022 --> 00:51:58,060
About time. This work should have been completed long before this.

607
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:00,721
Well, it isn't good enough!
是，但还不够!

608
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:02,704
Then get someone else, Bragen.
那你找其他人吧, Bragen.

609
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:07,222
Be careful! I shall be watching you, Valmar, after this - now get out!
小心点! 我会盯着你, Valmar, 从现在开始 - 现在给我出去!

610
00:52:11,217 --> 00:52:12,591
What does this intrusion mean?
这样闯进来是什么意思?

611
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,114
I'm sorry, Bragen. I tried to stop them.
抱歉, Bragen. 我没能拦住他们

612
00:52:15,372 --> 00:52:24,397
Intrusion? It's no intrusion. We're just returning the various calls that you made. This guard tried to tell us you were busy. You're not a bit, are you?
硬闯进来? 不是硬闯. 你不是要见我们吗，我们就来了
这个保安跟我们说你一直都忙，但你一点也不忙，是不?

613
00:52:24,751 --> 00:52:25,844
All right - I'll see them.
好了，我见他们

614
00:52:26,205 --> 00:52:32,831
Oh, what a nice new uniform. Very smart, very smart. I would like a hat like that.
喔, 新制服很不错啊. 很醒目. 很醒目. 我想要一顶类似的帽子.

615
00:52:33,286 --> 00:52:34,321
Well, what do you want?
你们想要干什么

616
00:52:34,591 --> 00:52:36,984
Some joker has kidnapped Polly and sent us this note.
某些小丑绑架了 Polly ，送来了这张字条

617
00:52:37,264 --> 00:52:37,936
Yes.

618
00:52:38,232 --> 00:52:40,062
Well, we want to know what you're doing to find her.
我们想知道你打算怎样找她

619
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:43,145
Now that the communications are restored we can start a search.
现在通讯已经恢复了，我们可以展开搜索

620
00:52:43,482 --> 00:52:47,054
Yeah, I can just imagine what kind of job you'll make of that. Haven't you heard anything yet?
好，我能想象你将会怎样做. 你没有听说什么吗?

621
00:52:47,268 --> 00:52:48,710
The planet is a large one.
这个星球很大

622
00:52:53,364 --> 00:52:56,901
So! They've given you the run of the colony, have they?
他们已经让你来运作整个基地，是吧

623
00:52:57,383 --> 00:53:07,060
We obey. Do I bring liquid for your visitors?
我们-服从. 需要-给你的-客人-准备-饮料吗?

624
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:09,607
No. They won't be staying much longer.
不必了. 他们不会呆多久.

625
00:53:19,754 --> 00:53:22,460
Look, Doctor, if he's not going to help us, we'll have to search for Polly ourselves.
看, 博士, 如果他不打算帮我们, 我们就得自己去找寻 Polly 了.

626
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:25,537
Sound advice. Why don't you, Doctor?
好主意, 为什么不去呢, 博士?

627
00:53:25,878 --> 00:53:28,672
Ah, ah, Examiner.
哦, 是监察员.

628
00:53:29,603 --> 00:53:33,353
I wonder how much longer they'll be able to move around on these floors?
我很好奇他们怎么能够在这些地板上转来转去?

629
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:34,117
Eh?

630
00:53:34,207 --> 00:53:40,737
Static you see. They need a constant supply of static from the floor, some sort of electrical field.
静电你看. 他们需要地板持续提供静电, 某种电力场.

631
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,731
Doctor. Why should he...?
博士, 为什么他会...?

632
00:54:03,812 --> 00:54:04,591
It's madness!
这太疯狂了!

633
00:54:04,956 --> 00:54:05,562
What is?
什么?

634
00:54:05,794 --> 00:54:08,661
Letting them run around like this.
允许他们像这样乱跑.

635
00:54:09,669 --> 00:54:13,893
Hey, wait a minute! Bragen had one acting as a servant, and we've just left him!
嘿, 等一下! Bragen 已经有一个做仆人的了, 我们刚离开那里!

636
00:54:14,575 --> 00:54:19,533
One Dalek in Bragen's office - three Daleks just gone down the corridors. That makes four!
一个 Dalek 在 Bragen 的办公室 - 三个 Daleks 刚走过了走廊. 总共就是四个!

637
00:54:20,426 --> 00:54:21,845
Where did the fourth one come from?
第四个哪里来的?

638
00:54:22,831 --> 00:54:29,535
Well, Lesterson can't have been making them. Perhaps there were more in the capsule than we thought?
Lesterson 不可能在制造它们.  说不定舱体里面还有一些, 而我们不知道?

639
00:54:30,486 --> 00:54:31,098
Janley?

640
00:54:31,825 --> 00:54:32,437
What is it?

641
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:35,613
The Daleks. They've given me another list of materials they need.
那些 Daleks. 他们又给了一份清单, 说它们需要这些材料.

642
00:54:35,846 --> 00:54:38,839
Let me see. We've got all those things?
我看看. 我们有这些东西吗?

643
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:47,417
Yes, but why these quantities, Janley? Why? How can they have used up all the materials I gave them? What is it? D... why, it's only a matter of a few hours ago.
有, 不过为什么要这么多, Janley? 他们怎么可能已经用完我给他们的材料了?
到底是什么情况? ... 才过了几个小时而已.

644
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:49,080
They're building new things for us.
他们在为我们建设新东西.

645
00:54:49,274 --> 00:54:54,626
Yes, well I don't want them to do anything without consulting me. What is it they do inside there?
是的, 我不想他们做事之前不问我的意见. 他们到底在那里面做什么?

646
00:54:54,869 --> 00:54:56,235
You're worrying too much.
你担心得过头了.

647
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:09,744
Look Janley, say what you like, but I'm beginning to believe that the Examiner is right about the Daleks. Their original thinking terrifies me. If we can control them, fine. But if not...
Janley 你说说你的看法. 不过我开始觉得监察员对 Daleks 的看法是对的
他们的想法吓着我了。如果我们能控制住他们, 那还好. 但如果不能...

648
00:55:11,472 --> 00:55:11,982
Yes?
怎样?
嗯?
怎么了?

649
00:55:13,401 --> 00:55:22,534
Then I shall have them destroyed. It's too dangerous. The Examiner knows something about them that we don't. I'm going to ask his advice.
那我就要把他们销毁. 这太危险了
监察员知道一些我们不知道的事情. 我要去问问他的建议.

650
00:55:23,322 --> 00:55:26,387
I wouldn't bring the Examiner into it if I were you.
如果我是你的话, 我不会把监察员扯进来.

651
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,144
And why not?
为什么不呢?

652
00:55:27,644 --> 00:55:29,960
You want him to find out about Resno?
你想让他发现 Resno 的事吗?

653
00:55:30,466 --> 00:55:32,880
Oh, a little accident. How is he? Is he better?
哦, 一点小事故. 他怎样了? 好些了吗?

654
00:55:33,089 --> 00:55:33,809
He's dead.
他死了.

655
00:55:36,221 --> 00:55:39,085
What are you talking about? You told me he was...
你在说什么呢? 你告诉我说他只是...

656
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:41,342
You're busy with the experiments on the Daleks.
你当时在忙着搞 Daleks 的实验.

657
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:47,729
But you should have told me. But... but the body - it'll have to be reported.
但你应该告诉我啊. 不过... 尸体怎么办 - 这事得上报.

658
00:55:48,074 --> 00:55:50,497
Don't worry, no one will find the body.
别担心, 没人会发现尸体.

659
00:55:51,946 --> 00:55:56,174
Oh Janley, you've done a terrible thing.
哦 Janley, 你干了一件很糟糕的事情.

660
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,660
The experiments on the Daleks were more important.
Daleks 的实验更加重要.

661
00:55:59,044 --> 00:56:01,948
More important than human life? No. No, I won't accept that.
比人命更重要? 不, 不, 我不会接受这个.

662
00:56:03,513 --> 00:56:13,282
You will. You must! Your carelessness was the cause of Resno's death. You murdered him. It's only your word against mine.
你会的. 你必须! 是你的粗心大意导致了 Resno 的死亡. 是你杀死了他.
除了我的证词, 你找不到别人证明

663
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:17,987
I won't be blackmailed by you!
我不会被你勒索的!

664
00:56:18,398 --> 00:56:23,085
All I want is for you to go on as you are. Scientific discovery can't stop dead, Lesterson.
我想要的只是你继续干你的事. 科学发现不应该在死亡面前停步, Lesterson.

665
00:56:24,526 --> 00:56:26,754
I told the guard that no-one was to be allowed in.
我告诉过保安没人可以进来.

666
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,710
"Accord every access" remember?
"授予一切权限" 记得吗?

667
00:56:28,935 --> 00:56:30,145
We're looking for Polly.
我们正在找寻 Polly.

668
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:32,350
Well, she isn't here, and I haven't seen her.
这样啊, 她并不在这里, 我也没看见过她.

669
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:33,567
Well, she's been kidnapped.
她被绑架了.

670
00:56:33,806 --> 00:56:35,203
Oh, it sounds a little unlikely.
哦, 听起来不太可能啊.

671
00:56:35,383 --> 00:56:37,541
Oh it does, does it? Well, we've got this note which tells us so.
很可能, 对不? 看, 我们还收到了这样字条, 上面是这样说的.

672
00:56:37,678 --> 00:56:40,408
I'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about it.
我很抱歉, 这事我什么也不知道.

673
00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:42,300
Lesterson?

674
00:56:42,584 --> 00:56:43,067
Yes?

675
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:46,699
You haven't been building Daleks, have you?
你没在建造 Daleks 吧, 有吗?

676
00:56:46,891 --> 00:56:49,894
Building? No I wouldn't know how to begin.
建造? 不, 我都不知道怎么开始.

677
00:56:50,132 --> 00:56:52,325
And there were only three in the capsule?
舱体里面当时只有三个?

678
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:53,162
Yes.

679
00:56:54,764 --> 00:56:59,813
Well we've just seen four. One in the Governor's office and three in the corridor!
但我们刚才看见了四个. 一个在总督的办公室, 三个在走廊!

680
00:57:01,467 --> 00:57:02,899
But that's not possible!
但那是不可能的啊!

681
00:57:03,277 --> 00:57:07,334
There's only one explanation. The Daleks are reproducing themselves!
这只有一个解释. Daleks 正在自我复制!

682
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,830
These things are machines. How could they reproduce?
他们只是机器而已, 怎么能自我复制呢?

683
00:57:10,124 --> 00:57:18,677
Machines! What makes you think they're just machines. The Daleks are brilliant engineers. Nothing is beyond them given the right materials.
机器! 凭什么你认为他们只是机器.
Daleks 是非常卓越的工程师, 只要有足够的材料, 没谁比他们厉害.

684
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:20,745
What?

685
00:57:21,979 --> 00:57:24,197
I said nothing is beyond them given the right materials.
我说只要有足够的材料, 没谁比他们厉害.

686
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:25,184
Oh...
哦...
哦...
噢...

687
00:57:25,419 --> 00:57:26,610
Lesterson, what's the matter?
Lesterson, 怎么回事?

688
00:57:26,928 --> 00:57:27,358
Oh...

689
00:57:28,702 --> 00:57:30,679
Leave him alone. He's just been overworking, that's all.
让他一个人呆会儿. 他劳累过度了, 仅此而已.

690
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,756
Well, he looks bad.
嗯, 他看来比较糟糕.

691
00:57:31,957 --> 00:57:38,060
Will you both go away. Guard! It's you - badgering him with questions. You've done nothing but hound him ever since you arrived on Vulcan.
保安!
你俩能不能离开. 保安! 就是你 - 拿些问题来纠缠他
自从你到 Vulcan 来, 除了干扰他你什么事情都没干.

692
00:57:38,731 --> 00:57:40,648
Bragen's orders were that no one was to be admitted.
Bragen 的命令是不让任何人进来.

693
00:57:40,976 --> 00:57:42,188
Yes, but I thought that the... the Examiner.
是的, 但是我觉得 ... 监察员....

694
00:57:42,414 --> 00:57:44,822
He attacked Lesterson. Get them out of here. Both of them.
他攻击了 Lesterson. 把他赶出去. 把他们俩.

695
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,089
He did not attack Lesterson.
他没有攻击 Lesterson.

696
00:57:46,444 --> 00:57:47,246
Out, do you hear?!
出去, 听见了吗?!

697
00:57:49,593 --> 00:57:50,655
All right, all right.
好吧, 好吧.

698
00:57:56,874 --> 00:58:01,346
Janley here. Tell Valmar to come over to the lab right away. Good.
我是 Janley. 告诉 Valmar 马上到实验室来一趟. 好

699
00:58:03,788 --> 00:58:06,453
Well, we're still no nearer finding Polly. What are we hanging about here for?
我们还是没有找到 Polly. 在这里闲着做什么呢?

700
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:09,549
Ben, I've found a message in code.
Ben, 我在文字里看到了一个消息.

701
00:58:09,827 --> 00:58:10,989
Oh, I can't do crosswords.
哦, 我不会做填字游戏.

702
00:58:12,634 --> 00:58:22,932
Meeting tonight, 2000 hours. R O C K E T - Rocket. R O O M - Room. P. Rocket Room P!
今晚会议, 晚上 20:00. R O C K E T - Rocket. R O O M - Room. P.  火箭室 P !

703
00:58:30,445 --> 00:58:36,235
It's the rebels way of calling a meeting. Only tonight we're going to be there - early.
这是叛乱分子召集会议的方法, 今晚我们得去那里 - 得早到.

704
00:58:36,853 --> 00:58:39,539
Yeah, maybe we're nearer finding Polly than I thought.
嘢, 也许能有线索找到 Polly.

705
00:58:59,256 --> 00:59:12,760
Now, we're going to demonstrate something. You section leaders can pass on what you've seen. So far, we've been concerned with testing the strength of the Governor with a few acts of sabotage. But now, we're ready to take over.
现在, 我们要展示一点东西. 你们这些区域头目可以把你们看见的事情回去传达一下
到目前为止, 我们还只是进行了几次破坏活动, 主要是为了试试总督的力量
但现在, 我们准备要夺权了.

706
00:59:13,311 --> 00:59:18,719
What is that thing? I've seen them moving about, but all we've been told is that it's a machine Lesterson discovered.
这是什么东西? 我看他们来回转, 但只是告诉我们说是 Lesterson 发现的一种机器.

707
00:59:18,974 --> 00:59:19,693
Valmar?

708
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:29,933
Well, Lesterson removed the armaments of the Daleks he discovered. I've rearmed this one, but with a controlling device. We can regulate the fire power and turn it off and on whenever we choose.
看, 这些 Daleks 是 Lesterson 发现的, 他移除了他们的的武器装备
我又重新给这个装上了, 但多接了一个控制器.
我们可以调节枪的火力, 甚至选择是否关闭.

709
00:59:31,017 --> 00:59:32,390
Shall we have the demonstration now?
我们可以演示了吗?

710
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:40,918
This screen is two inch thick tungsten steel. Right, Valmar.
这个屏幕是两英寸厚的钨锰合金. 开始吧, Valmar.
Valmar.

711
00:59:42,742 --> 00:59:45,007
Fire at the screen.
对着屏幕开火.

712
00:59:49,064 --> 00:59:51,918
Quiet! You must keep quiet. We're too vulnerable here.
安静! 你们必须保持安静. 你们太容易被发现了.
安静!

713
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:54,013
But, you can't control a thing like that. It'll turn on us!
但是你控制不住这样的东西, 它会攻击我们的!

714
00:59:54,182 --> 00:59:55,031
No it won't.
不, 它不会的.

715
00:59:55,769 --> 00:59:56,818
Now, what about the girl?
现在说下, 那女孩怎么办?

716
00:59:58,016 --> 00:59:59,720
We've got her safely locked up. Never fear.
我们把她锁起来了, 不用担心

717
00:59:59,957 --> 01:00:01,206
I think the best thing for us to do is...
我觉得我们最好是...

718
01:00:01,353 --> 01:00:02,781
Hear that? Maybe they'll say were she is.
听到了吗? 说不定他们会说出把她藏哪儿了

719
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:04,686
Who's there?
谁?

720
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:06,856
You stay there, I'll distract them. Find out where Polly is.
你待在这里, 我去引开他们. 找出 Polly 在哪里

721
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:07,647
No!
不!
不!

722
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:08,579
Help! Help!
救命! 救命!

723
01:00:08,895 --> 01:00:11,353
The guards will have heard that! Come on we've got to get out of here!

724
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:14,019
You might as well come out. We know you're there.
你最好也出来吧. 我们知道你在那儿

725
01:00:24,341 --> 01:00:25,331
Bragen!

726
01:00:25,587 --> 01:00:28,377
Of course. Who else is fitted to be leader of the rebels?
当然. 否则还有谁适合当这些人的领导?

727
01:00:28,624 --> 01:00:30,660
No doubt you want to be leader of the Daleks too.
毫无疑问你也相当 Daleks 的领导.

728
01:00:30,866 --> 01:00:32,385
I am the leader of the Daleks.
我的确是 Daleks 的领导

729
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:34,824
Well see if you can stop this one from killing me.
看看你能不能阻止这家伙杀我

730
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:44,409
Stop! You heard me, that's an order. Turn away. Fetch the guard.
停止! 你听到了, 这是命令. 转身, 去吧保安叫来

731
01:00:47,036 --> 01:00:50,554
I obey.

732
01:00:56,297 --> 01:01:02,468
You hope to have it both ways, Bragen. But how will you look in front of the Governor, when I explain your dual role to him?
你还真会两条腿走路啊, Bragen.
不过到了总督面前你会变成什么样子, 我会向他揭示你的双重身份的

733
01:01:02,689 --> 01:01:04,699
The Governor will hardly listen to an impostor.
总督不太可能相信一个冒名顶替者的话

734
01:01:05,095 --> 01:01:08,118
An impostor? How do you propose to prove that?
冒名顶替者? 你打算怎么证明这个?

735
01:01:08,629 --> 01:01:12,339
My guards are now going to produce the body of the real Examiner from the mercury swamp.

737
01:01:13,901 --> 01:01:15,039
The one you pretended to be.
被你假冒的那个

738
01:01:15,287 --> 01:01:18,920
Murder's a far worse crime than impersonation.
谋杀罪比冒名顶替严重多了

739
01:01:19,146 --> 01:01:24,619
Yes, but you can't prove I'm a murderer, while I can prove that you're an impostor.
是的, 但你没法证明我是个杀人犯, 而我却可以证明你是假冒的.

740
01:01:32,033 --> 01:01:33,390
Ah... Oh...
啊... 噢...

741
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,282

01:01:57,478 --> 01:02:07,385
They're conspiring together! Oh, why didn't I realise? The Examiner was right. They are evil!
他们在一起密谋什么! 噢, 我居然没发现?
监察员是对的, 他们是邪恶的!

745
01:02:19,165 --> 01:02:24,786
There are four. They can't be reproducing!

762
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:26,982
I started this, opening the capsule!
是我挑起的, 打开了太空舱!

763
01:06:27,225 --> 01:06:27,909
Lesterson!

764

Don't try to stop me!
别想阻止我!

765
01:06:29,387 --> 01:06:30,265
What happened?

01:06:34,182 --> 01:06:44,877
They forget that I control them! I gave them life back again, and now I've taken it away! Finished! Stopped it!
它们忘记了是该由我控制! 我重新给了它们生命复活了它们

767
01:06:45,387 --> 01:06:46,318
The Daleks...
那些 Daleks...

768
01:06:47,153 --> 01:07:01,114

770
01:07:02,534 --> 01:07:12,898

是的, 告诉每一个人我的事. 我还是要...我要... 抹掉这些 Daleks!

773
01:07:35,853 --> 01:07:40,132
How did you get there?! I cut off the power!
你怎么过来的?! 我已经把电源切断了!

774
01:07:40,368 --> 01:07:45,793
We can store power. We will soon have our own.

775
01:07:47,135 --> 01:07:48,147

每次-不要-三个-以上-Daleks-同时-出现-被人-看到

782
01:08:15,632 --> 01:08:16,861
I obey.

783
01:08:17,602 --> 01:08:26,003
We are not ready yet to teach these human beings the law of the Daleks.
我们-还没-打算-教导-这些-人类-学习-Daleks-的法律

784
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:36,566
Well, Bragen - these trips are becoming more and more demanding.
唉, Bragen - 这一趟趟的似乎越来越吃力了

785
01:08:36,995 --> 01:08:38,177
I didn't expect you, Governor.
没想到你会出现, 总督

786
01:08:38,424 --> 01:08:42,378
Ah, I had as much as I could stand. Well? What's been happening here?
啊, 再往外跑我就有点受不了了. 怎么样? 这里发生了什么?

787
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:43,934
One moment.
等一下.
等会儿.

788
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:45,571
I asked you a question, man.
我问你问题呢, 伙计.

I heard you.
我听见了.

01:08:47,328 --> 01:08:51,983
Look, your work can wait. You can hand over to me tomorrow. I want to hear about the Examiner.
嘿, 你的工作可以先放放. 明天转交回我就行了. 我想听听监察员的情况.

791
01:08:52,784 --> 01:09:00,082
He's an impostor, Governor. Possibly a murderer as well. We have just discovered the body of the real Examiner in the mercury swamp.
他是个假冒的, 总督. 还很可能是个谋杀犯
我们刚在水银沼泽里面发现了真监察员的尸体.

792
01:09:01,764 --> 01:09:04,396
I hope you're sure of your facts, Bragen.
我期望你说的情况都是事实, Bragen.

793
01:09:04,624 --> 01:09:05,330
Quite sure.
相当确定.

794
01:09:06,181 --> 01:09:09,074
This could have far-reaching consequences.
这可能会有长远的后果.

795
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:13,537
As far as I am concerned, there's nothing more to be said. So if there's nothing further...
就我所知, 这没什么需要补充的了. 如果没有其它事情...

796
01:09:13,718 --> 01:09:18,646
Nothing further! Who the devil do you think you're talking to? Stand up when you're speaking to me man!
没有其它! 你以为你在跟谁说话? 跟我说话的时候站起来!

797
01:09:19,877 --> 01:09:22,145
I prefer to remain seated.
我更愿意继续坐着.

798
01:09:22,417 --> 01:09:26,196
Do you now?! We'll soon see about that. Guards!

799
01:09:27,117 --> 01:09:28,677
Take this man out of my office.
把这个人带出我的办公室.

800
01:09:30,055 --> 01:09:32,179
Did you hear what I said? That's an order!
你们没有听见我说的吗? 这是命令!

801
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:35,398
You forget, my dear Hensell. They're not your guards - they're mine.
你忘记了, 我亲爱的 Hensell. 他们不是你的保安 - 他们是我的.

802
01:09:35,556 --> 01:09:36,580
I am the Governor!
我是总督!

803
01:09:36,863 --> 01:09:41,472
No. Not now. I am.
不. 现在不是了. 我才是.

804
01:09:42,002 --> 01:09:48,887
Oh, I see. Your guards, eh? Yes, Quinn warned me about your guards, but we all took them too lightly, didn't we?
哦, 我明白了. 你的保安, 呃? 是了, Quinn 警告过我关于你的保安的事情

805
01:09:49,074 --> 01:09:52,018
When the people hear that I am being kept a prisoner in my own capital...

806
01:09:52,253 --> 01:09:54,786
The people will do exactly as they are told, Hensell.
他们只会按照我们告诉他们的情况做出反应, Hensell.

807
01:09:56,564 --> 01:10:00,543
It will, of course, be easier for them if you co-operate with us.
当然, 如果你与我们合作的话, 事情会更容易一点.

808
01:10:10,518 --> 01:10:12,777
You're the last man I expected to see here.
你是我最没想到会在这里见到的人

809
01:10:13,081 --> 01:10:17,592
Well your imprisonment hasn't been entirely wasted. It's brought your enemy out into...
你被关起来倒不是完全没好处, 至少你的敌人露面...

810
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,798
Bragen? I've known that all along.
Bragen 是吧? 我一直都知道的.

811
01:10:19,973 --> 01:10:22,975
Yes. But, ah, did you know that he was the leader of the rebels?
是的. 但是你知道吗, 他是叛乱分子的头目

812
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:24,873
Hmm. Work's by sound, does it?
唔. 靠声音驱动的, 是吧?

813
01:10:31,386 --> 01:10:34,837
Wait there. Guards, dismissed.
等着. 保安, 你们可以出去了.

814
01:10:39,596 --> 01:10:43,905
So Bragen, you want my co-operation, do you?
怎样, Bragen, 你需要我的合作, 对吧?

815
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:48,936
It would save bloodshed. I might even let you keep the title of Governor.
这样能少流些血. 我甚至可以让你继续留着总督的头衔.

816
01:10:49,596 --> 01:10:56,608
Might you now?! I'll tell you what you will do. You'll order your guards to disarm and place yourself under arrest immediately!
你会吗?! 我来告诉你你将会做什么. 你让你的保安都解除武装, 立即逮捕你自己!

817
01:10:57,172 --> 01:11:01,843
So you reject my offer? I thought it a generous one in the circumstances.
这么说你拒绝我的提议? 我还觉得在当前情形下这是个挺慷慨的提议呢.

818
01:11:02,059 --> 01:11:04,610
What circumstances?
当前什么情形?

819
01:11:04,836 --> 01:11:05,545
Look at this.
看这里.
看看这个.

820
01:11:06,797 --> 01:11:07,774
What is it?

821
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:10,322
The reason that the colony is now mine.
这就是为什么这个基地现在是我的.

822
01:11:14,014 --> 01:11:17,504
Is it a weapon of some kind?
这是某种武器?

823
01:11:17,721 --> 01:11:22,268
I'll arrange a demonstration for you. Do you still refuse my offer?
我给你安排一个演示吧. 你还是拒绝我的提议吗?

824
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:25,254
I will not be intimidated.
我不会妥协的.

825
01:11:25,556 --> 01:11:32,299
Of course not. In character to the last, Hensell. Kill him!
当然不. 执迷不悟啊, Hensell. 杀了他!

826
01:11:43,251 --> 01:11:48,183
Why do human beings kill human beings?
为什么-人类-杀死-人类?

827
01:11:48,502 --> 01:11:49,438
Get on with your work!
去干你的活去!

828
01:11:49,551 --> 01:11:52,118
Yes, master. I obey.
是的-主人  我-服从.

829
01:11:52,354 --> 01:12:02,624
Yes, obey me! From now on, I will have complete obedience from everyone!
是的, 服从我! 从现在开始, 我要每个人都要绝对服从!

830
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:13,077
I'll have to check the cable circuit now. Otherwise, it's just as you asked for.
现在我还得检查一下线缆回路. 否则的话, it's just as you asked for.

831
01:12:14,245 --> 01:12:15,231
Very well.

832
01:12:15,518 --> 01:12:19,309
Why can't you carry on with the power you're drawing from the colony? Why go to all this trouble?
为什么你们不直接利用你从基地抽取到的能量呢? 费这个劲做什么?

833
01:12:19,553 --> 01:12:31,916
Until now, we have had to recharge from the colony supply. With static power, the Daleks will be twice as useful.
到目前-为止, 我们-还是-要用-基地-电力-充电
采用-静电, Daleks-将会-加倍-有用.

834
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:32,854
Valmar, quick!
Valmar, 快点!

835
01:12:33,188 --> 01:12:33,687
What's the matter?

836
01:12:33,866 --> 01:12:34,397
The Governor's back.
总督回来了.

837
01:12:34,626 --> 01:12:35,280

838

What for?
为什么?

841
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:40,540
I am your servant.

842
01:12:41,302 --> 01:12:41,786
Come on.

843
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:55,326
An electrical circuit of their own supplying static electricity! I wonder how much longer we've got?
他们自己的静电供电线路! 我好奇我们还有多少时间?

844
01:12:56,323 --> 01:12:59,098
I didn't realise they'd have a circuit of their own.

Well done! Who was the man who went outside just now?

Valmar. He's been working for the Daleks.

On their static power supply.

850
01:13:24,598 --> 01:13:25,591
Doctor, they've got Ben.
Doctor, 他们抓了 Ben.

851
01:13:25,728 --> 01:13:31,287
Yes, I know. He ran away so that I could... Oh well, it's a long story, but don't worry. That boy can take care of himself!
是的, 我知道. 他跑出来是为了让我... 噢, 这就说来话长了

852
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:33,007
Did you hear that? That won't help.

857

Have they escaped?

Yes, return to capsule and report.
是的-回到-舱内-然后-报告.

859
01:13:57,005 --> 01:13:58,446
I obey.

860
01:14:14,018 --> 01:14:20,349
We are to wait here until the human beings fight among themselves.

终结！
终结！ 终结！ 终结！

863
01:14:44,174 --> 01:14:47,533
But why? Why was he killed?

01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:48,624
I can answer that.
我能回答这个.

865
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:54,558
He wanted to destroy the Daleks, so one of them killed him. Now, I'm declaring martial law.
他想要销毁 Daleks, 所以其中一个就杀死了他.

866

The Daleks will do as I tell them.

868
01:15:01,344 --> 01:15:03,159

Take them away.

I thought they obeyed us?

886
01:16:24,303 --> 01:16:25,702
What do we do now, Doctor?
我们现在怎么办, Doctor?

887
01:16:27,135 --> 01:16:28,269
This way.
这边走.

888
01:16:32,315 --> 01:16:36,229
They will be exterminated.
他们-会被-毁灭.

889
01:16:36,444 --> 01:16:40,393
We've won. The revolution's over. I'll pass the word to Valmar, Kebble and the rest.
我们已经赢了. 革命已经结束了. 我将传话给 Valmar, Kebble 和其他人.

890
01:16:40,585 --> 01:16:44,032
Wait. The revolution is not quite over yet.
等等. 革命还没完全结束.

891
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:49,879
What more can we do? Hensell's dead, you're the new Governor. The battle's over.
我们还要做什么? Hensell 已经死了, 你成了新总督. 战斗也结束了.

892
01:16:50,086 --> 01:16:56,618

不完全. 你提到了 Kebble, Valmar 等一群人. 他们必须要处理掉.

I don't understand.
我不明白.

896
01:17:02,665 --> 01:17:19,706
Do you think I can ever be secure in that chair while that rabble are still loose? They rebelled against Hensell yesterday. Tomorrow it'll be my turn. Well, let them rebel. Tell them the guards have taken control. Let them attack, and then we can crush them, utterly!
如果这群闹事的人放任自流的话, 你觉得我可能是安全的吗?
他们昨天反叛的是 Hensell, 明天就可能轮到我了. 算了, 让他们闹事吧.
跟他们说保安已经掌握控制权了, 让他们进攻, 然后我们就可以镇压他们, 一举歼灭!

897
01:17:21,131 --> 01:17:23,488
You say "we".
你说了＂我们＂.

是的. 我们一路走了这么久, 你和我. 你现在要回那边去吗?

What have you brought me in here for?
你把我带来这里做什么?

903
01:17:50,769 --> 01:17:51,508

Whose side are you on anyway?

01:17:55,635 --> 01:17:57,922
I thought I was going to be on the winning side.

What changed your mind?
怎么改变主意了?

907
01:17:59,195 --> 01:18:03,982
Bragen. The colony's become too small for him. He wants us out of the way now.
Bragen. 这个基地对他来说太小了. 他现在不想要任何人挡他的道.

908
01:18:04,176 --> 01:18:06,945
Yeah, well it often happens that way, mate, when you follow blokes like him.
是的, 这种事最后经常是这样, 伙计, 当你跟着他这样的家伙.

Look, I'm going to try and get your friends here, if I can. So wait here.
看, 我要去试着把你的朋友们找来, 尽我所能. 你等在这里.

910
01:18:18,206 --> 01:18:36,529
People of Vulcan. This is your new Governor talking to you. I have to announce that Governor Hensell has been murdered by the rebels. I have taken control temporarily, until order is restored. People living on the perimeter and in the interior can stay calm. We know who the murderers are.
我已经暂时获得了控制权, 直到秩序恢复. 住在卫星城和内城的群众请保持冷静

911
01:18:36,867 --> 01:18:43,581
I shall keep you informed of events as soon as I am able, so listen for the signal to watch your communication sets. That is all.

912
01:18:45,426 --> 01:18:46,764
Ah! There you are.
啊! 你在这里啊.

913
01:18:46,829 --> 01:18:47,612

01:18:47,785 --> 01:18:48,583
Polly - you okay?
Polly - 你还好吧?

915
01:18:48,769 --> 01:18:49,328
Oh, yes.

916
01:18:49,536 --> 01:18:50,490
Did Valmar find you, then?
Valmar 去找你们了, 碰到了吗?

917
01:18:50,644 --> 01:18:51,291
Valmar? No.
Valmar? 没有.

918
01:18:51,456 --> 01:18:52,921
What's this about Valmar?
又有 Valmar 什么事?

919
01:18:53,138 --> 01:18:56,309
Well it seems Bragen's gone power-mad. He wants the rebels to revolt, then he can finish them off.
是这样, 看起来 Bragen 已经疯狂了. 他故意让叛乱分子起来闹事, 然后他好再把他们消灭掉.

920
01:18:56,534 --> 01:19:00,364
The Daleks won't care who they fight. They'll exterminate every human being on this planet.
Daleks 不会在乎跟谁打. 他们会毁灭这个星球上的每一个人.

921
01:19:00,627 --> 01:19:03,348
Doctor, please let's go back to the TARDIS.
Doctor, 求你了, 我们回到 TARDIS 去吧.

923
01:19:05,385 --> 01:19:06,588
Well, wait a minute, Doctor!
喂, 等一下, 博士!

924
01:19:07,558 --> 01:19:08,781
All right. All right.
好吧, 好吧. All right.

925
01:19:09,653 --> 01:19:14,398
Orders received. Daleks commence extermination.

Down everyone!

01:19:37,275 --> 01:19:38,458
Don't come any nearer.

What do you mean?
你什么意思?

930
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:45,980
I overheard your conversation with Bragen. But you can't stand up to the Daleks, so your plan will come to nothing.
我无意中听到你跟 Bragen 的谈话
但你们是没法站起来对抗 Daleks的, 因此你们的计划将会落空.

931
01:19:46,413 --> 01:19:47,665
Not my plan - Bragen's.
不是我的计划 - 是 Bragen 的.

932
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:48,680
But that's the same thing.

01:19:48,854 --> 01:19:49,483
Not any more.
不再是了.

934
01:19:49,665 --> 01:19:51,676
You expect me to believe that?
你期望我能相信?

935
01:19:52,161 --> 01:19:59,518
I came here to do exactly what you've done. Let Bragen see what the Daleks are like. He doesn't know how strong they are.
让 Bragen 看看 Daleks 到底是怎样的东西. 他不知道它们有多强悍.

936
01:19:59,771 --> 01:20:00,795
He's got to be stopped.
必须得有人阻止他.

937
01:20:00,808 --> 01:20:05,967
You will lead us to the middle of your party of human beings.

938
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:06,762

We will fight for you.

Believe me, Val, it's the only way to save all our lives.
相信我, Val, 这是救我们命的唯一方法.

941
01:20:13,955 --> 01:20:16,469
Did you know that the Daleks are duplicating?
你知道那些 Daleks 在自我复制吗?

942
01:20:16,674 --> 01:20:17,408
Yes.

943
01:20:17,573 --> 01:20:20,113
But we are your friends.

944
01:20:20,368 --> 01:20:22,531
We will serve you.

Take us to the centre of your group.

946
01:20:26,298 --> 01:20:27,442
Can we trust them?
我们能信任他们吗?

947
01:20:27,618 --> 01:20:33,778
We must! The guards have orders to wipe us out. We must use the Daleks. Come on.
必须得! 保安们已经收到命令要把我们彻底消灭. 我们必须得利用 Daleks. 快来.

948
01:20:44,808 --> 01:20:45,347

Ah!... Ah!... What's happening?
啊!... 啊!... 发生了什么?

953
01:20:52,925 --> 01:20:56,995
The Daleks. They're teeming all over the corridors. We've got to get back to Lesterson's lab.
Daleks. 他们在走廊集结, 都快挤满了. 我们得回到 Lesterson 的实验室去.

954
01:21:11,304 --> 01:21:24,005
This is Governor Bragen speaking. A group of rebels is attempting to take over the colony. It is the duty of all loyal citizens to help the guards resist. Stay in your homes. Order will be restored. Listen to my bulletins.
现在是总督 Bragen 讲话. 一组叛乱分子试图占领基地

The rebels are using the Daleks against our people!
叛乱分子正在利用 Daleks 反击我们的人!

956
01:21:27,478 --> 01:21:31,604
Well, get back and fight! Why do you come running to me? What do you think your guns are for?
那就回去战斗啊! 你跑到我这里来干什么? 你觉得你们的枪是干什么用的?

01:21:31,759 --> 01:21:32,862
Well, the guns don't work against them!

Get back and fight them!
回去, 打他们!

01:21:40,892 --> 01:21:42,062

No! No! Over there! They're our people!

You've killed our own people!

We have to dismantle the gun, that's all.

968
01:22:03,963 --> 01:22:05,280

Doctor, it's stupid to hide in here!

Ah!...

977
01:22:42,999 --> 01:22:50,769
You must be absolutely quiet. They know everything that's going on. Everything! They even know what you're thinking.
你们必须绝对安静. 它们知道当前的所有事情, 所有! 它们甚至知道你在想什么.

978
01:22:51,044 --> 01:22:52,949
Where do they get their power from, Lesterson?
他们的能量从哪里来的, Lesterson?

979
01:22:53,152 --> 01:23:01,343
Ah, I tried to turn the power off. But they were miles ahead of me. Marvellous creatures. You have to admire them.
啊, 我试过去切断电源, 但离我太远了. 神奇的生物啊, 你不得不佩服他们.

But we've got to stop them!
但我们要去阻止它们!

981
01:23:03,259 --> 01:23:16,809
Oh, it's too late for that. They're the new species, you see. Taking over from homo sapiens. Man's had his day. Finished now.
哦, 干这事儿太晚了. 它们是一个新的种族, 明白不.
开始从智人手中接管世界了. 人类终有这一天, 都结束了.

01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:29,139
The static circuit is nearly complete.
静电-线路-就快-完成.

01:23:29,787 --> 01:23:33,708
Soon we can abandon the power we are using.

The humans are being exterminated.

你听到了吗? 它们要开始使用它们自己的能量!

986
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:56,628

01:23:57,738 --> 01:23:58,707

01:24:13,604 --> 01:24:14,539
Take it easy, Polly.
别怕, Polly.

989
01:24:14,772 --> 01:24:18,491
Can't we do anything?! They're murdering everybody, one by one!
我们不能做点什么吗?! 他们在谋杀所有人, 一个接一个!

990
01:24:18,706 --> 01:24:21,320
You've done all this. Why did you give them power in the first place?
都是你造成的. 一开始你为什么要给它们提供能量?

991
01:24:21,731 --> 01:24:36,513
Well, I could control it, you see. And then Janley got one of her men - Valmar, I think it was, yes - and he rigged up a secret cable. It's carrying power directly from the colony's supply.
哦, 我当时可以控制住的, 你看. 然后 Janley 找了她们的一个人
- Valmar, 好像是这个名字 - 他安装了一个秘密线缆.
那个线缆直接由基地电厂提供电力.

992
01:24:37,213 --> 01:24:40,502
Where? Where is it, Lesterson?
哪儿? 在哪儿, Lesterson?

993
01:24:40,792 --> 01:24:49,349
Valmar's the only one who can answer that. Or the Daleks of course. They know everything. Yes, you should ask the Daleks.
Valmar 是唯一能回答这个问题的人. 当然 Daleks 也能
它们知道所有事情, 是的, 你问 Daleks 也可以.

994
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:52,271
Then we must find Valmar.
那么我们必须找到 Valmar.

995
01:24:52,385 --> 01:24:54,752
No! You stay here and look after Polly.
不! 你留在这里照顾 Polly.

996
01:24:54,963 --> 01:24:55,861
I'll go.
我过去（过来，快点！啊----）

997
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:32,906
You'll have to leave her now, Valmar.
你必须舍她而去了, Valmar.

998
01:25:36,242 --> 01:25:54,680

三分队? 噢, 为什么他们不回话? 我是总督. 为什么他们不回话?

999
01:26:40,221 --> 01:26:54,954
This is Bragen speaking. I'm speaking to the Daleks. Daleks, listen to me. I am the Governor. You must work for me. Do not trust the rebels. I will give you whatever you want. But immobilise your guns. This is the Governor speaking.
这里是 Bragen. 我现在同 Daleks 讲话.

我会给予你们想要的任何东西. 但请立即放下武器. 这里是总督在讲话.

1000
01:26:56,283 --> 01:26:58,018
He's nuts, trying to talk to the Daleks.
他是个蠢蛋, 居然想跟 Daleks 谈条件.

1001
01:26:59,533 --> 01:27:01,369
Lesterson, what's in that cupboard?
Lesterson, 这个柜子里面是什么?

1002
01:27:01,893 --> 01:27:03,459
Nothing. I think It's quite empty.

1003
01:27:03,639 --> 01:27:05,225
Well, come on, Polly, we'll be safe in there, love.
正好, 来吧, Polly, 我们躲在这里面比较安全, 很好.

Do you hear me, Daleks?! You will obey my orders!
你们听到我的话了没, Daleks?! 你们必须服从我的命令!

1006
01:27:12,569 --> 01:27:13,746
Ah! Guards!
啊! 保安!

1007

都死了! Daleks 杀死了他们. 你在内城里还有几个保安小队. 他们到这里要多久?

1008
01:27:19,394 --> 01:27:20,215
That depends.

1009
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:21,574
Well, get them!

1010

Well, they will be intercepted by the Daleks.
但他们也会被 Daleks 拦截住.

1011
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:26,572
Exactly! It will draw them away from here and give the Doctor a chance to deal with them.
正是! 这会把它们从这里引开, 给博士去寻找对付它们的机会.

1012
01:27:26,761 --> 01:27:28,901
I refuse to allow my guards to be sacrificed.
我拒绝让我的保安们去做牺牲.

1013
01:27:29,053 --> 01:27:33,556
In that case the Daleks will destroy everything on this colony.

1014
01:27:37,003 --> 01:27:44,578
Guards. This is Bragen speaking. All units will report immediately to the capital. Be prepared to face the rebel Daleks.
保安. 我是 Bragen. 所有小组马上到首府报告

很好, 因为我们要进去. 快来 Valmar. _.

Of course I do!

01:28:06,967 --> 01:28:09,398
Well, why can't you just take all the plugs out and cut the power off?
嗯, 为什么你不直接把插头都拔掉, 这样不就都切断了?

1025
01:28:09,543 --> 01:28:11,323
Because I prefer to do it my way!
因为我更喜欢按我的方法来!

1026
01:28:11,902 --> 01:28:12,944
Look out!
小心!

1027
01:28:19,772 --> 01:28:25,918
Static power is being stored. We can dismantle the human electric system.
静电-能量-已经-储存. 我们-可以-拆除-人类-电力-系统.

We do not need humans now.
我们-不-需要-人类-现在

What happened to it?
它怎么了?

1042
01:30:43,931 --> 01:30:44,940

It seems that your friend, the Examiner, was successful after all.
看来你的朋友, 那个监察员, 获得了最终胜利.

You'll obey me, or...

你的日子已经结束了, Bragen. 现在没人再服从你了.

You know you did!

1061

You used the power from the colony's electric supply - overfed it - and blew up their temporary static circuit. Well didn't you?
你用光了基地供电系统的电力 - 让它们过载了 - 炸掉了它们的临时静电电路. 干得不错啊?

1062

Did I do all that?
是我干的吗?

1063

你是阻止了 Daleks, 但你就没想到你对这个基地造成的损害吗?

1064
01:31:55,113 --> 01:31:56,487
Oh. There was a blow back, was there?
哦. There was a blow back, was there?
