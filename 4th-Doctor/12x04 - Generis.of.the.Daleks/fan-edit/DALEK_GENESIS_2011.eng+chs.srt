There's centuries between these two weapons.
这两种武器相差了好几个世纪

What's that on his jacket?
他外套上是什么东西?

5
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:57,595
Radiation detector and a gas mask.
The two things don't go together, do they?
辐射探测器和防毒面具, 这两个东西凑不到一起吧, 不是吗?

00:00:57,687 --> 00:01:00,804
It's like finding remains of a stone age man

-Same mixture of ancient and modern, though.
-Yes.
-但还是原始与先进技术混杂在一起  -是啊

That's why I think this war
has being going on for a very long time.
这就是为什么我认为 这场战争已经持续很久了

19
00:01:56,587 --> 00:02:00,546
They probably started out with the most modern
equipment but no longer have the resources.
他们或许最开始配备着最先进的装备

20
00:02:00,627 --> 00:02:03,744
-Have to make do.
-War of attrition, eh? Only backwards.
-只能凑合着用了 -消耗战 只能倒退

21
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:06,295
At this rate, they're going to finish up with
bows and arrows.
照这样下去 他们最终就只剩下弓箭能用了

22
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:08,264
Well, it would explain the mixture of equipment.
呃 这样就解释了装备的混杂

23
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:09,706

Some kind of service tunnel, I suppose.
我想大概是某种作业巷道

27
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,059
It might even lead into the dome.

Let's see where the trench leads.
