1
00:33:04,052 --> 00:33:07,727
Doctor, please, don't tell... Doctor!

2
00:33:07,812 --> 00:33:09,484
All right, all right!

3
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:11,403
Just leave them alone.

4
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:15,764
Dalek invasion of the Earth in the year 2000

5
00:33:15,852 --> 00:33:19,401
was foiled because of an attempt by the Daleks
to mine the core of the planet.

6
00:33:19,492 --> 00:33:21,562
<i>-The magnetic properties of the Earth...</i>
-Mars...

7
00:33:21,652 --> 00:33:25,645
the Daleks were defeated
by a virus that attacked the insulation

8
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:28,485
on the cables in their electrical systems.

9
00:33:29,692 --> 00:33:32,889
...in the space year 1 7,000,

10
00:33:32,972 --> 00:33:36,089
was halted by the intervention
of a fleet of war rockets

11
00:33:36,172 --> 00:33:38,242
from the planet Hyperon.

12
00:33:39,652 --> 00:33:42,166
The rockets were made of a metal

13
00:33:42,252 --> 00:33:45,449
that was completely resistant to Dalek firepower.

14
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:49,045
The Dalek Task Force was completely destroyed.

15
00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:54,289
<i>It seems an opportune moment</i>
<i>to end this session. Nyder.</i>

16
00:33:58,932 --> 00:34:02,368
<i>Release the prisoners.</i>
<i>Take them to the detention area.</i>

17
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:09,448
<i>Interrogation will continue later.</i>
<i>And I must thank you, Doctor.</i>

18
00:34:09,532 --> 00:34:11,568
<i>What you have told me will be invaluable.</i>

19
00:34:11,652 --> 00:34:14,564
<i>All the information, this foreknowledge,</i>

20
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:17,849
<i>will be programmed into the Dalek memory banks.</i>
<i>Take them away.</i>

21
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:26,371
<i>Doctor, stay a moment.</i>

22
00:34:27,212 --> 00:34:28,804
<i>Sit down.</i>

23
00:34:29,372 --> 00:34:32,921
<i>Let us talk together now,</i>
<i>not as prisoner and captor,</i>

24
00:34:33,012 --> 00:34:35,207
<i>but as men of science.</i>

25
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:37,601
<i>There is so much I wish to know.</i>

26
00:34:38,172 --> 00:34:40,970
<i>-Nyder, take charge of the tape.</i>
-Immediately, Davros.

27
00:34:41,052 --> 00:34:44,886
<i>It will be your responsibility</i>
<i>and remember, it is priceless.</i>

28
00:34:44,972 --> 00:34:47,088
<i>Its value beyond computation.</i>

29
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:04,924
-Thank you.
-Who are you?

30
00:35:05,012 --> 00:35:06,764
-My name's Gharman.
-Gharman?

31
00:35:06,852 --> 00:35:10,447
Until a few hours ago,
I was head of the Military Elite Scientific Corps.

32
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:13,968
And now you're a prisoner like us?
What happened?

33
00:35:15,252 --> 00:35:16,367
Wait.

34
00:35:18,972 --> 00:35:21,440
I was trying to organise
a movement against Davros.

35
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:23,409
He found out.

36
00:35:23,492 --> 00:35:25,244
Now, what's happening out there?

37
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:28,529
Has there been any attempt
to take away control from Davros?

38
00:35:28,612 --> 00:35:30,125
Not that we know of.

39
00:35:41,012 --> 00:35:43,810
Halt! State your business.

40
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:45,884
I wish to question the prisoners.

41
00:35:45,972 --> 00:35:47,849
Nobody is allowed
to communicate with the prisoners

42
00:35:47,932 --> 00:35:50,685
unless they have a pass signed by Davros.

43
00:35:52,252 --> 00:35:53,890
Stay where you are!

44
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,570
I...seem to have mislaid it.

45
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,530
I'll come back later.

46
00:36:08,212 --> 00:36:10,885
<i>Now future errors will be eradicated.</i>

47
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:12,883
<i>Defeats will become victories.</i>

48
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:15,770
<i>You have changed</i>
<i>the future of the universe, Doctor.</i>

49
00:36:15,852 --> 00:36:18,047
I have betrayed the future.

50
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:20,965
Davros, for the last time,
consider what you're doing.

51
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:22,770
Stop the development of the Daleks.

52
00:36:22,852 --> 00:36:25,969
<i>Impossible. It is beyond my control.</i>

53
00:36:26,052 --> 00:36:30,330
<i>The workshops are already fully automated</i>
<i>to produce the Dalek machines.</i>

54
00:36:30,412 --> 00:36:34,121
It's not the machines.
It's the minds of the creatures inside them.

55
00:36:34,212 --> 00:36:37,249
Minds that you created. They are totally evil.

56
00:36:37,332 --> 00:36:38,970
<i>Evil? No.</i>

57
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:41,602
<i>No, I will not accept that.</i>

58
00:36:42,052 --> 00:36:44,725
<i>They are conditioned simply to survive.</i>

59
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:48,442
<i>They can survive only by becoming</i>
<i>the dominant species.</i>

60
00:36:48,572 --> 00:36:50,722
<i>When all other life forms are suppressed,</i>

61
00:36:50,812 --> 00:36:54,043
<i>when the Daleks are the supreme rulers</i>
<i>of the universe,</i>

62
00:36:54,132 --> 00:36:57,090
<i>then you will have peace.</i>

63
00:36:57,812 --> 00:36:59,484
<i>Wars will end.</i>

64
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:03,883
<i>They are the power not of evil, but of good!</i>

65
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:09,205
Davros, if you had created
a virus in your laboratory,

66
00:37:09,332 --> 00:37:12,881
something contagious and infectious
that killed on contact,

67
00:37:12,972 --> 00:37:16,044
a virus that would destroy all other forms of life,

68
00:37:16,132 --> 00:37:17,850
would you allow its use?

69
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:20,446
<i>-It is an interesting conjecture.</i>
-Would you do it?

70
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,727
<i>The only living thing,</i>

71
00:37:23,372 --> 00:37:25,806
<i>a microscopic organism,</i>

72
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:27,962
<i>reigning supreme.</i>

73
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:31,850
<i>-A fascinating idea.</i>
-But would you do it?

74
00:37:33,012 --> 00:37:34,411
<i>Yes.</i>

75
00:37:35,652 --> 00:37:37,051
<i>Yes.</i>

76
00:37:38,252 --> 00:37:40,607
<i>To hold in my hand</i>

77
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,684
<i>a capsule that contains such power,</i>

78
00:37:44,572 --> 00:37:49,282
<i>to know that life and death</i>
<i>on such a scale was my choice.</i>

79
00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:53,208
<i>To know that the tiny pressure on my thumb,</i>

80
00:37:53,692 --> 00:37:57,651
<i>enough to break the glass, would end everything.</i>

81
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:00,291
<i>Yes.</i>

82
00:38:01,332 --> 00:38:03,004
<i>I would do it.</i>

83
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:07,048
<i>That power would set me up above the gods.</i>

84
00:38:07,132 --> 00:38:11,171
<i>And through the Daleks, I shall have that power!</i>

85
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:22,926
<i>-Release me.</i>
-No, Davros.

86
00:38:24,212 --> 00:38:26,680
<i>-Don't touch that switch.</i>
-Why not?

87
00:38:27,412 --> 00:38:30,085
<i>It controls my life support systems.</i>

88
00:38:30,452 --> 00:38:33,171
<i>I could not survive 30 seconds without them.</i>

89
00:38:33,252 --> 00:38:35,686
Order the destruction of the incubator section.

90
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,728
<i>Destroy the Daleks? Never.</i>

91
00:38:39,772 --> 00:38:41,410
(ALARM BEEPING)

92
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:47,930
I mean it, Davros.

93
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:52,164
Next time I press that switch, it stays pressed.
Now give the order!

94
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:56,601
<i>Even if I do this, there will be no escape for you.</i>

95
00:38:56,692 --> 00:38:59,570
I'll take that chance. Now give the order.

96
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:02,682
<i>Press the communicator switch.</i>

97
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:07,528
<i>This is Davros.</i>

98
00:39:07,772 --> 00:39:10,844
<i>Elite unit 7 will go to the incubator room.</i>

99
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:15,280
<i>All survival maintenance systems</i>
<i>are to be closed down.</i>

100
00:39:15,732 --> 00:39:19,645
<i>The Dalek creatures are to be destroyed.</i>

101
00:39:20,332 --> 00:39:23,290
Tell them the order cannot be countermanded.

102
00:39:24,012 --> 00:39:26,048
<i>This order cannot...</i>

103
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,444
<i>This is Davros. This is Davros.</i>

104
00:39:30,532 --> 00:39:33,729
<i>My last order is cancelled. Repeat, cancelled.</i>

105
00:39:33,812 --> 00:39:35,768
<i>No action is to be taken.</i>

106
00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:38,727
What do you want done with this?

107
00:39:38,892 --> 00:39:41,531
<i>For the moment, he must be kept alive.</i>

108
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,524
<i>He has knowledge that is vital to our future.</i>

109
00:39:44,612 --> 00:39:49,083
<i>And I will drain</i>
<i>every last detail of it from his mind.</i>

110
00:39:49,172 --> 00:39:51,003
<i>And then,</i>

111
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:54,209
<i>he will learn the true meaning of pain.</i>

112
00:39:54,612 --> 00:39:56,603
I will take him to the detention room.

113
00:39:57,412 --> 00:40:00,449
<i>The dissidents. What progress are they making?</i>

114
00:40:02,292 --> 00:40:04,522
Feeling against you is rising.

115
00:40:05,092 --> 00:40:08,243
Many of the scientific corps
are openly speaking against you.

116
00:40:08,332 --> 00:40:10,209
Even some of the military are joining them.

117
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:11,805
<i>As I expected.</i>

118
00:40:13,252 --> 00:40:16,210
<i>-They will take action soon?</i>
-Almost certainly.

119
00:40:16,732 --> 00:40:19,041
They outnumber those of us who are loyal.

120
00:40:19,132 --> 00:40:23,967
Davros, why don't you let me take
a squad of Elite men I can trust?

121
00:40:24,692 --> 00:40:27,525
In an hour, I could wipe out their leaders.

122
00:40:27,612 --> 00:40:29,842
<i>You think like a soldier, Nyder.</i>

123
00:40:29,932 --> 00:40:32,002
<i>Rebellion is an idea in the mind.</i>

124
00:40:32,092 --> 00:40:36,165
<i>Suppress it and it hides away and festers.</i>

125
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,968
<i>No. My way is best.</i>

126
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:41,051
As you wish.

127
00:40:42,012 --> 00:40:43,411
On your feet!

128
00:40:46,092 --> 00:40:47,320
Open up.

129
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:57,169
Not exactly as planned, Sarah.

130
00:40:57,732 --> 00:40:59,290
Doctor.

131
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:04,489
-He's a bit groggy but he'll be all right.
-Come on, Kavell, we've a lot to do.

132
00:41:04,572 --> 00:41:07,291
What about the guards?
Suppose they won't come over to our side?

133
00:41:07,372 --> 00:41:10,762
They'll be disarmed and held in custody
until we've presented our ultimatum to Davros.

134
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:14,322
No, wait, wait. Davros knows what you're planning.

135
00:41:14,412 --> 00:41:16,323
I heard him talking to Nyder.

136
00:41:16,412 --> 00:41:19,245
If he knows,
why hasn't he taken action against us?

137
00:41:19,332 --> 00:41:21,084
Perhaps because he knows it's futile.

138
00:41:21,172 --> 00:41:23,766
-There are too many of us.
-No, no, it's not that.

139
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:27,003
I don't know what he's got prepared for you
but believe me, he's ready.

140
00:41:27,092 --> 00:41:29,287
Even so, there'll still be too many for him.

141
00:41:29,372 --> 00:41:31,522
Just be careful. Be careful.

142
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:35,287
I think we can take care of things.
Thanks for the warning.

143
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:40,569
-No point in telling you to rest, I suppose.
-No, there isn't.

144
00:41:40,652 --> 00:41:42,244
We've got to recover that time ring.

145
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:46,086
Because without it, we'll never get off this planet.
But where is it?

146
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:48,367
It's on the desk in the main laboratory.

147
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:53,085
And there's that tape recording that Nyder took.
We've got to get it back at all costs.

148
00:41:53,172 --> 00:41:55,732
It would make the Daleks invincible. Come on.

149
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:06,369
Davros, they're taking over. We must act quickly.

150
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,804
In another hour, they could be totally in control.

151
00:42:09,892 --> 00:42:12,042
Do you hear me, Davros?

152
00:42:12,132 --> 00:42:15,124
I have a dozen crack men hiding in section 9.

153
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:17,762
Let me order them into action.

154
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:20,249
-Davros?
<i>-I hear you.</i>

155
00:42:20,652 --> 00:42:23,086
Then what are we going to do?

156
00:42:23,172 --> 00:42:27,324
<i>I want you to find their leaders</i>
<i>and hand over your weapons to them.</i>

157
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:28,606
Surrender?

158
00:42:28,692 --> 00:42:32,605
<i>Order all members of the Elite guards</i>
<i>still at liberty to do the same.</i>

159
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,162
Do you know what you're saying?

160
00:42:42,212 --> 00:42:44,646
<i>I know precisely what I am saying.</i>

161
00:42:45,092 --> 00:42:47,731
<i>Now, I will command and you will obey!</i>

162
00:42:48,972 --> 00:42:51,361
<i>You will do as I order!</i>

163
00:42:54,612 --> 00:42:59,606
<i>You will inform the rebel leaders</i>
<i>that I have given these orders to avoid bloodshed.</i>

164
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:04,769
<i>Tell them I submit</i>
<i>and will listen to their demands.</i>

165
00:43:04,852 --> 00:43:07,764
<i>-That is all.</i>
-Then we are admitting that we're beaten.

166
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:09,570
<i>That is what they will believe.</i>

167
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:13,000
You mean that...

168
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:18,007
<i>You and they will find out exactly what I mean</i>
<i>all in good time.</i>

169
00:43:18,732 --> 00:43:20,404
<i>Now carry out my orders.</i>

(WHISPERING) Useful.

172
00:44:04,452 --> 00:44:05,487
Ah.

173
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:08,848
This is something rather more useful.

174
00:44:08,932 --> 00:44:10,923
-They're explosives, aren't they?
-Yes.

175
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:13,728
Explosives and detonators.

176
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,884
It seems almost providential.

177
00:44:15,972 --> 00:44:17,963
Why? What are you going to use them for?

178
00:44:18,052 --> 00:44:20,486
The Time Lord gave me three options.

179
00:44:20,572 --> 00:44:22,881
There's only one still open.

180
00:44:22,972 --> 00:44:24,883
-Genocide.
-Genocide?

181
00:44:24,972 --> 00:44:28,567
Yes. I'm going to kill everything
in the incubation room.

182
00:44:29,172 --> 00:44:31,925
I'm going to destroy the Daleks forever.

183
00:44:41,252 --> 00:44:43,208
Where is Davros?

184
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:46,443
-You said that Davros had agreed to meet us here.
-He'll be here.

185
00:44:59,092 --> 00:45:00,844
<i>You have something to say to me?</i>

186
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:04,004
Davros, we wish to make our views plain to you
concerning our work here.

187
00:45:04,092 --> 00:45:07,880
<i>With what authority do you speak?</i>
<i>With whose backing?</i>

188
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:11,851
We speak for virtually all the Elite scientific corps
and many of the military.

189
00:45:11,932 --> 00:45:13,809
We represent the majority.

190
00:45:13,892 --> 00:45:15,803
<i>Very well. Continue.</i>

191
00:45:17,332 --> 00:45:19,288
Nobody disputes that in the past,

192
00:45:19,372 --> 00:45:22,648
under your guidance, we've made
incredible progress in many fields of science.

193
00:45:22,732 --> 00:45:25,849
<i>You did not come here to flatter me.</i>
<i>You came to offer an ultimatum.</i>

194
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:28,446
<i>Confine yourself to the terms of that ultimatum.</i>

195
00:45:28,532 --> 00:45:29,965
Very well.

196
00:45:30,052 --> 00:45:31,724
The initial concept of the Dalek

197
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,372
was to build a life support system
and a travel machine

198
00:45:34,452 --> 00:45:37,444
for the creature that we know
our race will ultimately evolve into.

199
00:45:37,532 --> 00:45:39,090
<i>You disapprove of that?</i>

200
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:41,970
No, but we believe that concept
has been perverted.

201
00:45:42,052 --> 00:45:45,601
You have tampered
with the genetic structuring of the creature

202
00:45:45,692 --> 00:45:48,206
to create a ruthless power for evil.

203
00:45:48,692 --> 00:45:51,126
We cannot permit this to continue.

204
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:54,007
<i>Then what do you suggest?</i>

205
00:45:55,212 --> 00:45:58,488
All work on Dalek projects is to cease immediately.

206
00:45:58,572 --> 00:46:01,405
The creatures that have been conditioned
and programmed are to be destroyed.

207
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,687
If these terms are met, we will then be proud

208
00:46:03,772 --> 00:46:06,923
to work under your guidance
on the rebuilding of our society.

209
00:46:07,012 --> 00:46:09,048
<i>And if I refuse?</i>

210
00:46:09,132 --> 00:46:11,885
If you refuse, you will be placed under arrest.

211
00:46:11,972 --> 00:46:15,089
The Daleks will be destroyed
and our work here will then continue

212
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:18,289
under a new, democratically elected leader.

213
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:25,244
<i>Have you finished?</i>

214
00:46:27,692 --> 00:46:29,045
Well?

215
00:46:29,692 --> 00:46:33,844
<i>You might at least do me the courtesy</i>
<i>of giving me time to consider.</i>

216
00:46:47,412 --> 00:46:49,004
(SQUEAKING)

217
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,603
The Daleks are in there.

218
00:46:59,132 --> 00:47:00,884
The flesh and blood part of them.

219
00:47:00,972 --> 00:47:02,564
Indeed they are flesh and blood.

220
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:04,324
Some of them can move about.

221
00:47:04,412 --> 00:47:06,323
Well, how do I see?

222
00:47:06,412 --> 00:47:08,050
Press the button.

223
00:47:15,972 --> 00:47:17,644
-Here we go.
-Harry.

224
00:47:20,452 --> 00:47:22,647
You're not going in there, are you?

225
00:47:22,732 --> 00:47:25,451
They're harmless enough, I think. Just unpleasant.

226
00:47:25,532 --> 00:47:28,410
-You don't want me to come in, do you, Doctor?
-There's no need, Harry.

227
00:47:28,492 --> 00:47:31,689
It just remains to put the charges
where they'll do the most damage.

228
00:47:31,772 --> 00:47:34,809
It shouldn't take me more
than a couple of minutes.

229
00:47:42,932 --> 00:47:44,809
<i>I have made my decision.</i>

230
00:47:47,052 --> 00:47:49,008
<i>I accept your ultimatum.</i>

231
00:47:50,172 --> 00:47:52,686
<i>-On one condition.</i>
-Go on.

232
00:47:52,812 --> 00:47:56,851
<i>That you allow me to speak to a full meeting</i>
<i>of the Elite, both scientific and military.</i>

233
00:47:56,932 --> 00:47:58,684
<i>Anyone you elect may speak against me.</i>

234
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:01,127
<i>When this is done, a vote will be taken.</i>

235
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,362
<i>I will abide by the decision of the majority.</i>

236
00:48:03,452 --> 00:48:07,240
You already know the decision of the majority.
You will lose, Davros.

237
00:48:07,332 --> 00:48:10,130
<i>With such confidence,</i>
<i>you can hardly deny my request.</i>

238
00:48:10,212 --> 00:48:13,841
<i>It was you who introduced the word ''democracy''.</i>

239
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,809
Do we accept his proposition?

240
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,803
Very well, it's agreed.

241
00:48:17,892 --> 00:48:20,929
<i>The meeting will take place in one hour from now.</i>
<i>Arrange it.</i>

242
00:48:21,012 --> 00:48:22,684
<i>You may go.</i>

243
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:33,602
<i>Ours is the victory, Nyder. We have won.</i>

244
00:48:57,332 --> 00:48:58,811
What's taking him so long?

245
00:48:58,892 --> 00:49:00,723
It's a very delicate operation, Sarah.

246
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,370
Still, he should've finished by now.

247
00:49:03,332 --> 00:49:04,526
Doctor?

248
00:49:06,332 --> 00:49:08,004
Doctor, are you all right?

249
01:26:40,812 --> 01:26:43,007
(DOCTOR WHO THEME)

250
01:27:13,132 --> 01:27:14,804
Don't tell him, Doctor!

251
01:27:17,372 --> 01:27:21,650
<i>Now, you will tell me the reason</i>
<i>for every Dalek defeat.</i>

252
01:27:22,212 --> 01:27:24,168
<i>With that knowledge, I will program them.</i>

253
01:27:24,252 --> 01:27:27,562
<i>With that knowledge, they will know</i>
<i>their errors and how to avoid them.</i>

254
01:27:27,652 --> 01:27:30,450
<i>With that knowledge, there will be no defeats!</i>

255
01:27:30,532 --> 01:27:32,204
<i>We will begin!</i>

256
01:27:33,492 --> 01:27:35,084
Davros...

257
01:27:35,172 --> 01:27:38,847
if I tell you what you want to know,
I betray millions of people in the future.

258
01:27:38,932 --> 01:27:40,445
I can't do that.

259
01:27:40,532 --> 01:27:43,365
<i>But you can. You will tell me!</i>

260
01:27:43,652 --> 01:27:46,166
<i>You will tell me!</i>

261
01:27:46,612 --> 01:27:48,921
<i>You will tell me!</i>

262
01:30:19,252 --> 01:30:21,049
I don't understand.

263
01:30:23,172 --> 01:30:24,844
You see,

264
01:30:24,932 --> 01:30:29,050
Davros tricked me into giving him the names
of the group who were plotting against him.

265
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:32,283
Have there not been
mass arrests by now? Executions?

266
01:30:32,372 --> 01:30:34,488
Well, it all seemed pretty quiet out there.

267
01:30:34,572 --> 01:30:37,291
But Davros knows that
we're planning action against him.

268
01:30:37,372 --> 01:30:39,044
Why hasn't he moved to stop it? Why?

269
01:30:39,132 --> 01:30:41,441
Perhaps that'd be too obvious. Even for Davros.

270
01:30:41,532 --> 01:30:45,081
Well, if that's true,
he's being too clever for his own good.

271
01:30:45,172 --> 01:30:48,562
Every moment he delays,
our movement grows in strength.

272
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:50,688
-Oh, I hope you're right.
-I know I am.

273
01:30:50,772 --> 01:30:53,206
Many of us believe
that production of the Daleks must end.

274
01:30:53,292 --> 01:30:55,886
I believe now that we are in the majority.

275
01:30:55,972 --> 01:30:58,281
If we act soon, we can break his power.

276
01:30:58,372 --> 01:31:02,160
We're not in much of a position
to act at the moment, are we?

277
01:31:02,932 --> 01:31:05,924
If only I could get word to them. Now!

278
01:36:26,972 --> 01:36:31,124
<i>All Dalek units! All Dalek units!</i>

279
01:36:45,652 --> 01:36:49,964
<i>Davros has commanded</i>
<i>all Dalek units to disengage</i>

280
01:36:50,052 --> 01:36:53,124
<i>and return to the bunker immediately.</i>

281
01:36:53,412 --> 01:36:54,891
<i>I obey.</i>

282
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:07,846
Shh! There's something moving out there.

283
01:37:14,292 --> 01:37:16,487
The whole of the Thal city is burning.

284
01:37:16,572 --> 01:37:19,848
The Daleks are moving through it,
section by section,

285
01:37:19,932 --> 01:37:21,843
hunting down the survivors.

286
01:37:21,932 --> 01:37:23,729
Then there's no one left?

287
01:37:23,812 --> 01:37:27,725
No, I covered a fairly large area and found no one.

288
01:37:29,292 --> 01:37:32,409
-No one living that is.
-So we're on our own.

289
01:37:32,492 --> 01:37:34,528
You're still gonna attack
the main entrance, aren't you?

290
01:37:34,612 --> 01:37:36,045
There's no point in delaying any longer.

291
01:37:36,132 --> 01:37:38,168
We'll move more safely
under the cover of darkness.

292
01:37:38,252 --> 01:37:39,924
Come on, get ready. We're moving out.

293
01:39:05,132 --> 01:39:06,565
Ready?

294
01:39:06,652 --> 01:39:11,203
Now remember,
we resort to violence only if there's no other way.

295
01:39:13,652 --> 01:39:16,450
Stay perfectly still. Take their weapons.

296
01:39:47,412 --> 01:39:48,640
No!

297
01:39:51,492 --> 01:39:55,087
That was stupid. A stupid waste of life.

298
01:39:55,372 --> 01:39:58,762
Our intention has always been
to make a bloodless revolution.

299
01:39:58,852 --> 01:40:01,082
There's been enough of killing and violence.

300
01:40:01,172 --> 01:40:04,767
All right, take him away
and lock him up with the others.

301
01:40:16,092 --> 01:40:18,048
Start passing these out to our people.

302
01:40:19,612 --> 01:40:20,806
Gharman.

303
01:40:21,332 --> 01:40:23,846
Gharman, they're coming over
to our side in droves.

304
01:40:23,932 --> 01:40:27,163
-We've the backing of a good 80% now.
-Good. Good.

305
01:40:27,252 --> 01:40:30,608
-What about the hard-core Davros people?
-They've all been rounded up.

306
01:40:30,692 --> 01:40:33,331
We're winning, Gharman. We're winning.

307
01:40:33,892 --> 01:40:35,883
Then let's finish it off.

308
01:47:24,492 --> 01:47:28,007
<i>They talk of democracy, freedom, fairness.</i>

309
01:47:28,732 --> 01:47:30,962
<i>Those are the creeds of cowards.</i>

310
01:47:31,052 --> 01:47:35,204
<i>The ones who will listen to a thousand viewpoints</i>
<i>and try to satisfy them all.</i>

311
01:47:35,292 --> 01:47:38,967
<i>Achievement comes through absolute power.</i>

312
01:47:39,052 --> 01:47:41,885
<i>And power through strength.</i>

313
01:47:42,332 --> 01:47:43,924
<i>They have lost!</i>

314
01:47:52,452 --> 01:47:55,842
The entrance to the bunker
is just beyond the next rise.

315
01:47:55,932 --> 01:47:58,366
That's where they must be heading.
