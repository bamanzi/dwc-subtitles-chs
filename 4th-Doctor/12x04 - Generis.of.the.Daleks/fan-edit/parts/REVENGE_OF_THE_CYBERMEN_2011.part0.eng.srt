01:02:36,367 --> 01:02:39,040
Thank heaven for that. We've made it.

3
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,446
-Haven't we?
-Of course we've made it.

4
01:02:41,527 --> 01:02:42,676
Did you think we wouldn't?

5
01:02:42,767 --> 01:02:44,917
Well, in these past few weeks, yes.

6
01:02:45,007 --> 01:02:45,996
-Quite frequently.
-There is really nothing

7
01:02:46,087 --> 01:02:50,603
that could go wrong with the time ring,
except the molecular short circuit.

8
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:52,200
-Doctor.
-Yes?

9
01:02:52,647 --> 01:02:54,558
The Tardis isn't here.

10
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:58,207
Well, it probably hasn't arrived yet.
We're a little early.

11
01:02:58,287 --> 01:02:59,402
Hasn't arrived yet?

12
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:02,399
No, you see, the Tardis is drifting back
through time, Harry.

13
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,239
We'll just have to wait
for it to turn up.

(CHUCKLES)

15
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:06,800

did you want this ring thing?

16

-What, that?
-Yes.

17
01:03:08,007 --> 01:03:09,884
-No.
-Oh, well, I'd rather like to have it.

18
01:03:09,967 --> 01:03:14,245
-Well, you take good care of it, Harry.
-Of course I will. Thank you.

You knew that was gonna happen,
didn't you?

21
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:33,404
-He's dead. Been dead some time.
-How long?

22
01:03:33,807 --> 01:03:35,399
A week or two, I'd say.

23

Yes, exactly, and no sign of injury.

26
01:03:41,447 --> 01:03:43,005
Nothing to indicate the cause of death.

27
01:03:43,087 --> 01:03:47,046
Well, he was just sitting against
the door as though he'd collapsed.

28
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:49,880
He wouldn't have been there
for two weeks unless...

29
01:03:49,967 --> 01:03:51,320
Unless what?

30
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:54,604
Unless there was something
seriously wrong here.

01:03:55,047 --> 01:03:56,366

No, Lester,
this beacon's job is finished.

72
01:06:34,807 --> 01:06:37,082
Nerva beacon
has a 30-year-assignment.

73
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:39,635
And it will be that long
before the last inward bound ship

74
01:06:39,727 --> 01:06:41,922
has this new asteroid on its star chart.

75
01:06:42,007 --> 01:06:45,761
Until then, there's a constant danger
of space collision.

some good friends among them, and yet
a thing like that is still alive.

80
01:07:00,007 --> 01:07:03,079
It's probably because he locked himself
in that cabin of his

81
01:07:03,167 --> 01:07:05,442

83
01:07:07,207 --> 01:07:11,246
It's only these last few days
he's dared poke his nose outside.

84
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,160
Is it jammed?

85
01:07:49,807 --> 01:07:53,243
-The control's locked.
-You mean we can't get any further?

86
01:07:53,327 --> 01:07:55,124
Those poor fellows couldn't.

87
01:07:55,207 --> 01:07:58,517
They were trapped in the after end
and left to die.

88
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:01,804
Whatever did it
might be on the other side of this door.

89
01:08:01,887 --> 01:08:02,876
There might be a way of opening it.

90
01:08:02,967 --> 01:08:04,798
Look, are you sure
we're in the right place, Doctor?

91
01:08:04,887 --> 01:08:06,718
I mean, this doesn't look like our ark.

01:08:06,807 --> 01:08:08,877
Well, of course it doesn't.
This is a different point in time.

93

-How can you tell?
-Some of that equipment.

94
01:08:12,207 --> 01:08:13,435
This is probably a beacon,

space freighters.

-Thousands of years before, Harry.

Well, I am not even going
to think about it,

I'll only get a headache.

100
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:26,806
All you have to remember
is that this is where we parted company

Oh, nobody knows.

124
01:09:50,127 --> 01:09:52,118
It was first detected in our system
50 years ago

-and it was captured by Jupiter.
-So there could be life on it?

Impossible.

An asteroid that size? Drifting
in the vacuum between star systems?

Nothing could have lived
under those conditions.

Every time that someone goes down
that transom

139
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:26,758

Do you feel kinship?

171
01:12:19,207 --> 01:12:21,402
No, no, it's simply
that there are so many things

172
01:12:21,487 --> 01:12:22,556
which might go wrong.

173
01:12:22,647 --> 01:12:25,684
Of course, it's a big plan,
but it will work.

174
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:28,358
You and I together, Magrik,
we'll make it work.

175
01:12:28,447 --> 01:12:30,756
Yes, but can we trust our agent?

176
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:34,886
We can trust in his greed.
Gold buys humans.

177
01:12:35,367 --> 01:12:38,643
And we have more gold here on Voga
than in the rest of the known galaxy.

178
01:12:38,727 --> 01:12:40,763
But he has not communicated.

179
01:12:40,847 --> 01:12:41,916
Better he should not at this time.

180
01:12:42,007 --> 01:12:44,282
The Cybermen may be monitoring
our radio frequencies.

181
01:12:44,367 --> 01:12:45,766
(COUGHING)

182
01:12:46,447 --> 01:12:49,644
The mention of Cybermen
fills me with dread.

183
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:51,236
You feel fear, Magrik,

184
01:12:51,327 --> 01:12:55,206
because you've lived for too long
in this underground darkness.

185
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:59,724
When I lead our people into the light,
all those ancient fears will fall away.

186
01:12:59,807 --> 01:13:00,796
The light.

187
01:13:00,887 --> 01:13:02,206
(COUGHS)

188
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:05,557

The rivets have been taken out.

191
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:46,564
But from the outside, sir,
but that's impossible,

192
01:13:46,647 --> 01:13:47,841
they're blind-headed.

193
01:13:47,927 --> 01:13:50,202
They could have been loosened
with a sonic vibrator.

194
01:13:50,287 --> 01:13:52,755
Well, in that case, Warner is right.
Somebody has come through.

195
01:13:52,847 --> 01:13:55,361
Right, then we'll have to check
every section, come on.

196
01:14:24,607 --> 01:14:28,156
-We just left here.
-No, this is the forward control room.

197
01:14:28,247 --> 01:14:30,363
Well, the Tardis doesn't seem
to be here either, does it?

198
01:14:30,447 --> 01:14:33,007
No, but the time ring is designed
with a slight safety margin.

199
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,440
We can expect it to arrive soon.

200
01:14:34,687 --> 01:14:36,279
HARRY: Doctor, do you expect me
to believe that

201
01:14:36,367 --> 01:14:40,042
that old police box
is going to materialise out of nothing?

202
01:14:44,447 --> 01:14:45,516
Right, put your hands up.

203
01:14:45,607 --> 01:14:47,643
I said get your hands up!

204
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,403
Now who are you? How did you get here?

205
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:53,160
I'm the Doctor,
this is Sarah Jane Smith,

206
01:14:53,247 --> 01:14:55,636
Harry Sullivan. We're travellers.

207
01:14:56,927 --> 01:14:59,316
-You'd better step in here, Commander.
-What is it?

208
01:14:59,407 --> 01:15:00,965
See for yourself.

209
01:15:01,047 --> 01:15:02,480
Watch them.

210
01:15:03,687 --> 01:15:05,245
LESTER: All of you. Come on, move.

211
01:15:08,567 --> 01:15:10,364
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

212
01:15:18,967 --> 01:15:21,117
-What are you going to do?
-Get back, he's got the plague.

213
01:15:21,207 --> 01:15:22,356
This is the only way to deal with it.

214
01:15:22,447 --> 01:15:25,598
-The man's sick. He needs treatment.
-There is no treatment.

215
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,121
All we can try to do
is stop the infection spreading.

216
01:15:28,207 --> 01:15:31,643
-Sorry, gentlemen, I can't allow it.
-You can't allow it?

217
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:34,764
My colleague is a doctor of medicine,
and I'm a doctor of many things.

218
01:15:34,847 --> 01:15:36,166
-If we could examine...
-Commander!

219
01:15:36,247 --> 01:15:38,078
I'm afraid you'll have to kill
these people, too.

220
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:40,203
They've brought the plague in here.

221
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:42,323
Who's the homicidal maniac?

222
01:15:42,407 --> 01:15:44,398
You say you're doctors.
Did Earth Centre send you?

223
01:15:44,487 --> 01:15:46,159
Yes, we're from Earth,
we want to help you.

224
01:15:46,247 --> 01:15:47,600
Help us?

225
01:15:47,687 --> 01:15:49,518
Don't you realise you brought
the infection through

226
01:15:49,607 --> 01:15:52,405
-from the aft section?
-Oh, don't be ridiculous.

227
01:15:52,487 --> 01:15:55,285
How could we have brought it through
when he's infected and we aren't?

228
01:15:55,367 --> 01:15:57,005
It's quite impossible,
we've had no contact with him.

229
01:15:57,087 --> 01:15:59,396
I don't believe you've got
the plague here, Commander.

230
01:15:59,487 --> 01:16:01,364
According to our own medical team,
we have.

231
01:16:01,447 --> 01:16:02,766
Did they identify it?

232
01:16:02,847 --> 01:16:04,997
They didn't have time.
They were among the first victims.

233
01:16:05,087 --> 01:16:07,965
Well, now you've got a new medical team.

234
01:16:08,327 --> 01:16:09,965
Well, Commander?

(WARNER BREATHING RAGGEDLY)

236
01:16:13,407 --> 01:16:14,886
-All right, you can examine him.
-Thank you.

237
01:16:14,967 --> 01:16:18,198
But not here. It will have to be done
in the crew quarters.

238
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:20,084
The control room
must be kept operational.

239
01:16:20,167 --> 01:16:22,522
Oh, yes, at all costs.

240
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:27,280
Lester, help the doctors with him,
I'll take over the console.

241
01:16:29,647 --> 01:16:32,605
Once the infection develops,
they've got a few minutes to live.

242
01:16:32,687 --> 01:16:34,245
I'll help you.

<i>-A third?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

253
01:17:37,927 --> 01:17:39,804
<i>One, it scratches metal.</i>

254
01:17:39,887 --> 01:17:41,605
<i>Two, it attacks its victims so suddenly</i>

255
01:17:41,687 --> 01:17:44,440
<i>that they become unconscious</i>
<i>before they can even raise the alarm.</i>

<i>-And three...</i>
<i>-Go on.</i>

<i>It removes tape from radio logs.</i>

258

to lose one space crew

275

than take the chance of carrying
an extraterrestrial disease

haven't got it on their charts yet.

-What's it called?
-Neo Phobos originally,

288
01:19:07,167 --> 01:19:09,601
but Kellman's renamed it Voga.

289
01:19:09,687 --> 01:19:10,881
Voga.

290
01:19:12,327 --> 01:19:13,726
Of course.

01:19:14,287 --> 01:19:15,640
Has he been down there?

-Cybermen.

Cybermen died out centuries ago.

They disappeared after their attack
on Voga at the end of the Cyber War.

Not the same thing
as dying out, Commander.
