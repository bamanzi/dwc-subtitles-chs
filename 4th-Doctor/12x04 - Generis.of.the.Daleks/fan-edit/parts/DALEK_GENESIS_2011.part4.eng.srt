he helped you to destroy his own race.

<i>Nevertheless, someone has</i>

172
01:11:56,047 --> 01:12:00,484
<i>and his treachery has resulted</i>
<i>in the total extermination of our people.</i>

173
01:14:12,407 --> 01:14:16,116
<i>The action you take today</i>
<i>is a beginning of a journey</i>

174
01:14:16,207 --> 01:14:18,641
<i>that will take the Daleks to their destiny</i>

175
01:14:18,727 --> 01:14:22,436
<i>of universal and absolute supremacy!</i>

176
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:26,920
<i>You have been conditioned</i>
<i>and programmed to complete a task!</i>

177
01:14:27,167 --> 01:14:30,762
<i>You will now carry out that program.</i>

178
01:14:30,887 --> 01:14:32,639
DALEKS: <i>We obey.</i>

179
01:14:38,727 --> 01:14:42,276
1 ,000 years of war and now it's ended.

180
01:14:42,367 --> 01:14:45,245
Listen. The people, they know already.

181
01:14:45,327 --> 01:14:47,636
Gentlemen, there's a great deal to be done.

182
01:14:47,727 --> 01:14:49,524
I must speak to the people.

183
01:14:49,607 --> 01:14:51,279
There must be a victory parade.

184
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:53,517
And as for him, he must be punished.

185
01:14:53,727 --> 01:14:57,606
No. Let us now show
that whilst we were ruthless in war,

186
01:14:57,727 --> 01:14:59,957
we are generous in victory.

187
01:15:00,047 --> 01:15:02,766
Let all prisoners be freed,
charges against them dropped.

188
01:15:02,847 --> 01:15:04,963
Issue that statement at once.

189
01:16:07,047 --> 01:16:09,242
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

190
01:16:26,647 --> 01:16:28,922
<i>That outlines the chromosomal variations</i>

191
01:16:29,007 --> 01:16:31,396
<i>to be introduced into the embryo Daleks.</i>

192
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:33,637
<i>It is to be implemented at once, Gharman.</i>

193
01:16:33,727 --> 01:16:38,437
-Davros, this will create enormous mental defects.
<i>-Not defects, improvements!</i>

194
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:43,203
It'll mean creatures without conscience.
No sense of right or wrong. No pity.

195
01:16:43,287 --> 01:16:47,041
-They'll be without feeling or emotion.
<i>-Correct!</i>

196
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:49,078
<i>Now see that my orders are carried out.</i>

197
01:16:49,167 --> 01:16:51,601
-But you...
<i>-Without question, Gharman!</i>

198
01:18:28,127 --> 01:18:30,766
DAVROS: <i>The beginning, only the beginning!</i>

199
01:18:30,847 --> 01:18:33,600
<i>From this moment, all other research must cease.</i>

200
01:18:33,687 --> 01:18:37,521
<i>Absolute priority is to be given</i>
<i>to the building of my Dalek force!</i>

201
01:18:37,647 --> 01:18:42,437
<i>Nothing, absolutely nothing,</i>
<i>must delay this glorious project!</i>

202
01:21:23,127 --> 01:21:24,924
I wonder if you'd have a look at this.

203
01:21:25,007 --> 01:21:28,204
I'm having a problem
with the dimensional thought circuit.

204
01:21:31,607 --> 01:21:33,802
We must stop the Daleks, Kavell.

205
01:21:35,807 --> 01:21:39,846
I don't want to get involved.
You saw what happened to Ronson.

206
01:21:40,847 --> 01:21:45,318
Davros wouldn't hesitate to have us killed
if he suspected we were plotting against him.

207
01:21:45,407 --> 01:21:47,967
Then we must make our plans
so he won't suspect anything.

208
01:21:48,047 --> 01:21:50,959
-Elite troops will stay loyal to him.
-That's not important!

209
01:21:51,047 --> 01:21:54,676
If the whole of the scientific corps
act against Davros, he can't proceed.

210
01:21:54,767 --> 01:21:58,043
We can then demand
that the Dalek project is halted.

211
01:21:58,127 --> 01:22:01,358
His whole concept is monstrous.
It's evil and immoral.

212
01:22:02,727 --> 01:22:05,082
What do you want me to do?

213
01:22:05,167 --> 01:22:06,395
Spread the word.

214
01:22:06,487 --> 01:22:10,799
Convince those who waver how vital it is
that the whole Dalek project be ended.

215
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:14,279
I'll do what I can.

216
01:23:44,487 --> 01:23:46,239
Gharman, I must talk to you.

217
01:23:46,847 --> 01:23:48,724
-It's of vital importance.
-Not now.

218
01:23:48,807 --> 01:23:50,240
Then soon!

219
01:23:50,327 --> 01:23:53,842
-And somewhere we can talk in private.
-What's this about, Nyder?

220
01:23:56,127 --> 01:23:59,437
You know that I have served Davros
faithfully for many years.

221
01:23:59,527 --> 01:24:02,041
I've never questioned anything he has done.

222
01:24:02,967 --> 01:24:05,322
But he has become a megalomaniac.

223
01:24:06,407 --> 01:24:10,195
He's ready to sacrifice everything and everyone,

224
01:24:10,687 --> 01:24:12,279
including us...

225
01:24:13,327 --> 01:24:16,319
just so that the Dalek project can be completed.

226
01:24:18,247 --> 01:24:20,317
You're not alone in your fears.

227
01:24:21,287 --> 01:24:22,800
Where can we meet in safety?

228
01:24:22,887 --> 01:24:25,879
The only place Davros never goes
is the lower level.

229
01:24:26,007 --> 01:24:28,805
Well, there's the detention room down there.

230
01:24:29,887 --> 01:24:31,036
Good.

231
01:24:31,487 --> 01:24:33,717
I'll meet you there as soon as I can.

232
01:24:39,087 --> 01:24:40,884
DOCTOR: Not much further.

233
01:24:41,327 --> 01:24:44,763
The entrance to the ventilation duct
must be just through here.

234
01:24:47,487 --> 01:24:50,001
HARRY: You sure, Doctor? It doesn't look familiar.

235
01:24:52,647 --> 01:24:54,683
DOCTOR: Look out, Harry!

(SARAH SCREAMING)

237
01:24:57,407 --> 01:24:58,840
Jump!

238
01:25:05,647 --> 01:25:07,239
I'll never eat oysters again.

239
01:25:07,327 --> 01:25:10,956
-They're not very fast.
-It's obviously why Davros discarded them.

240
01:25:11,047 --> 01:25:12,560
Come on, we're there.

241
01:26:04,967 --> 01:26:06,082
Nyder?

242
01:26:14,407 --> 01:26:16,443
I had to be sure it was you.

243
01:26:18,447 --> 01:26:21,200
We'll make this as quick as we can.
I don't want to be missed.

244
01:26:21,287 --> 01:26:22,879
What are we going to do?

245
01:26:22,967 --> 01:26:25,959
Look, a number of the scientists believe as we do.

246
01:26:26,047 --> 01:26:30,040
When we have enough strength on our side,
we'll then give to Davros an ultimatum.

247
01:26:30,127 --> 01:26:31,765
What ultimatum do you suggest?

248
01:26:31,847 --> 01:26:34,281
That we will only continue
with the work on the Daleks

249
01:26:34,367 --> 01:26:37,086
if he restores the brain cells, the conscience.

250
01:26:38,327 --> 01:26:42,559
The creature must have a moral sense,
a judgement of right and wrong.

251
01:26:42,927 --> 01:26:46,602
In fact, all the qualities that we believe
are essential in ourselves.

252
01:26:46,687 --> 01:26:49,201
And if he doesn't accept that ultimatum?

253
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:52,916
Then we will destroy all the work
that has been done. Everything.

254
01:26:53,447 --> 01:26:56,245
It'll be as though the Dalek were never created.

255
01:26:56,407 --> 01:26:59,843
Right, I'll try and get some
of the military Elite on our side.

256
01:27:00,327 --> 01:27:03,478
-Who can you count on?
-Kavell, Frenton, Parran.

257
01:27:03,567 --> 01:27:06,206
There'll be more soon, I'm sure of it.

258
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:07,606
Thank you.

259
01:27:09,287 --> 01:27:11,164
That's what I wanted to know.

260
01:27:14,767 --> 01:27:19,158
<i>That information will prove most helpful.</i>

261
01:27:29,567 --> 01:27:30,966
<i>A pity.</i>

262
01:27:31,927 --> 01:27:34,725
<i>He has a good scientific mind.</i>

263
01:27:35,527 --> 01:27:37,199
-Shall I kill him?
<i>-No.</i>

264
01:27:37,767 --> 01:27:41,840
<i>A little surgery on the brain</i>
<i>will remove these stupid emotions</i>

266
01:27:45,847 --> 01:27:48,315
-And the other plotters?
<i>-The same for them.</i>

267
01:27:48,407 --> 01:27:50,875
<i>But we must move carefully,</i>

268
01:27:51,607 --> 01:27:53,882
<i>not force their hands.</i>

269
01:27:53,967 --> 01:27:58,119
<i>Let us learn who are our allies</i>
<i>and who are our enemies.</i>

270
01:27:59,247 --> 01:28:03,001
<i>Leave Gharman here, safely locked away.</i>

It's coming from over there.

274
01:28:26,047 --> 01:28:27,685
There's somebody in the ventilator shaft.

275
01:31:09,327 --> 01:31:13,525
-We don't have much of a fighting force.
-I'm afraid my people won't be much help.

276
01:31:13,647 --> 01:31:15,319
They don't like fighting.

277
01:31:15,407 --> 01:31:19,002
At least we have weapons
and a fair amount of explosives, too.

278
01:31:19,087 --> 01:31:21,078
Are you going to attack
the main entrance to the bunker?

279
01:31:21,167 --> 01:31:23,965
As long as there are people inside
risking their lives to destroy the Daleks,

280
01:31:24,047 --> 01:31:26,481
-that's the least we can do.
-When will you attack?

281
01:31:26,567 --> 01:31:29,161
As soon as we've rested
and picked up any stragglers.

282
01:31:29,247 --> 01:31:30,919
But they need your help now.

283
01:31:31,007 --> 01:31:33,919
We must wait until we have
the strongest possible force.

284
01:31:34,007 --> 01:31:35,804
Then we'll attack.
