1
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:29,277
Sit down.

2
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:30,843
Thank you.

3
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,114
You're not with the military, I assume?

4
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:39,480
-I'm with the science division.
-Oh, good, good.

5
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:42,761
Then perhaps we can talk without interruption
from rifle butts.

6
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:44,482
That depends.

7
00:03:44,564 --> 00:03:47,636
If you don't answer my questions,
I shall hand you back to the military.

8
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:50,079
They take a pride in loosening tongues.

9
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:53,514
Now, where did you get these things?

10
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:55,196
Oh, here and there.

11
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:58,515
If I didn't know better, I should have to assume

12
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:01,482
that these were made
by some intelligence on another planet.

13
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:03,839
If you didn't know better.

14
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:07,200
It is an established scientific fact
that in the seven galaxies

15
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:10,196
only Skaro is capable of supporting intelligent life.

16
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:14,994
It is also an established scientific fact
that there are more than seven galaxies.

17
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:17,032
-Indeed.
-Yes.

18
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,160
When you passed through our security scan

19
00:04:19,244 --> 00:04:22,839
our instruments ran a complete check
on your blood and chemical make-up,

20
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:25,313
encephalographic patterns and so on.

21
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:29,716
Physiological compositions,
and so if you are from another planet...

22
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:35,763
-You were saying...
-There's nothing.

23
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:39,917
Nothing conforms to any known life on this planet.

24
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:43,395
Apart from external appearances.

25
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:46,476
You can't always judge from external appearances.

26
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:50,036
Who are you?

27
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,354
-Where are you from?
-It's a long story.

28
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:56,715
Then tell me.

29
00:04:57,524 --> 00:05:01,995
Do you have any inkling of the theory
of space dimension correlated to relative time?

30
00:05:02,284 --> 00:05:04,240
(ALARM RINGING)

31
00:05:05,924 --> 00:05:09,234
(OVER INTERCOM) <i>Davros wishes</i>
<i>all members of the Elite scientific corps</i>

32
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:11,792
<i>to assemble in the main laboratory immediately.</i>

33
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:13,602
Our session will have to wait.

34
00:05:13,684 --> 00:05:15,800
-Davros is coming.
-Your chief scientist?

35
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:17,602
He's our supreme commander.

36
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,276
When he calls a full meeting like this,

37
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:22,003
he obviously has something
of the greatest importance to tell us.

38
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:25,963
-Well, I shall be delighted to meet him.
-Stand up and keep quiet.

39
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:36,915
<i>If I may have your attention.</i>

40
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,803
<i>For some time</i>

41
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:42,876
<i>I have been experimenting</i>
<i>with the Mark III project.</i>

42
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,914
<i>Details of modifications</i>
<i>will be distributed later, however...</i>

43
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:50,474
<i>I am anxious that you should see immediately</i>

44
00:05:50,604 --> 00:05:53,072
<i>the remarkable results that I have achieved.</i>

45
00:05:54,204 --> 00:05:56,001
<i>And to that end</i>

46
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:58,803
<i>I have arranged this demonstration.</i>

47
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:15,001
-A Dalek.
-What?

48
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:18,315
A Dalek, very primitive but undeniably a Dalek.

49
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:21,521
You're mistaken. It's a Mark III travel machine.

50
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:24,116
-If you say so.
-DAVROS: <i>Halt.</i>

51
00:06:25,324 --> 00:06:27,440
<i>Turn left, move forward.</i>

52
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:31,440
That's magnificent. He's perfected voice control.

53
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:33,477
<i>Turn right.</i>

54
00:06:35,164 --> 00:06:37,553
<i>Move forward and circle left.</i>

55
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:42,276
<i>You will agree, I think,</i>
<i>that voice control represents</i>

56
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:45,515
<i>an enormous step forward, however,</i>

57
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:48,994
<i>the best is yet to come. Nyder.</i>

58
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:14,193
<i>Our machine is now equipped</i>
<i>with a weapon for self-defence.</i>

59
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:20,075
<i>Now, I am going to turn the machine over</i>
<i>to total self-control.</i>

60
00:07:20,164 --> 00:07:22,439
<i>It will be entirely independent</i>

61
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:24,913
<i>of all outside influences.</i>

62
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:30,920
<i>A living, thinking, self-supporting creature.</i>

63
00:07:41,884 --> 00:07:43,761
DAVROS: <i>Brilliant.</i>

64
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:47,393
<i>Brilliant! It has detected the non-conformity.</i>

65
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:50,681
DALEK: <i>Aliens. I must exterminate.</i>

66
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:52,914
<i>-Exterminate.</i>
-No.

67
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:58,474
<i>You dare to interfere!</i>

68
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:02,239
<i>You have the audacity to interrupt</i>
<i>one of my experiments.</i>

69
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:05,873
<i>-But it would have destroyed him.</i>
<i>-So you think the saving of a worthless life</i>

70
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:08,432
<i>more important than the progress we have made?</i>

71
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:11,402
<i>My creature showed a natural desire,</i>

72
00:08:11,484 --> 00:08:15,397
<i>an instinct to destroy and you interceded.</i>

73
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:18,157
<i>You will be punished for this!</i>

74
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:20,394
Davros, I'm sorry.

75
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:23,874
But I believe these prisoners,
they could be extremely valuable.

76
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:28,323
By all means, when I finish my questions,
let the machine do what it likes with them but...

77
00:08:28,404 --> 00:08:30,634
I do need to interrogate them further.

78
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:34,003
<i>You will be punished for insubordination.</i>

79
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:38,441
<i>In the meantime, you may question the prisoners</i>
<i>until first light.</i>

80
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:42,517
<i>After that, they will be used to resume</i>
<i>the experiment.</i>

81
00:08:42,884 --> 00:08:44,795
<i>This meeting is ended.</i>

82
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:57,001
-Thank you, I am obliged to you.
-I was merely doing my duty.

83
00:08:57,084 --> 00:09:00,872
I believe that you have knowledge
which could be of the greatest assistance to us.

84
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:04,476
But if you don't cooperate,

85
00:09:04,564 --> 00:09:07,795
then it is certain that Davros will use you
as an experiment

86
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:09,602
with his machine in a few hours' time.

87
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:13,438
The prisoners are to be taken to the cells,
you can continue questioning them there.

88
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:15,196
Davros orders it.

89
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:37,243
-You all right?
-Looks like I might be.

90
00:09:37,324 --> 00:09:38,803
What happened?

91
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:42,039
They took down reams of notes.

92
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,922
Every bit of scientific gobbledegook
I could think of.

93
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:47,199
Technical jargon that even I didn't understand.

94
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:49,798
-That'll keep their experts tied up for weeks.
-Yes.

95
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:52,603
And I learnt a great deal more from them
than they did from me.

96
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:54,117
-About this bunker?
-Yes.

97
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:57,037
-It is underground, isn't it?
-Yes, bomb-proof.

98
00:09:57,124 --> 00:10:01,276
Impregnable from attack from the outside and
about three or four miles from the Kaled dome.

99
00:10:01,364 --> 00:10:03,082
What are they doing down here?

100
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:06,361
Years ago, the Kaled government
decided to form an elite group.

101
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:08,196
The best scientific brains in every field.

102
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:09,876
-A sort of think tank.
-Yes.

103
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:12,478
But over the years the Elite has become
more and more powerful

104
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:15,032
and now they can demand whatever they like.

105
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:16,876
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

106
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:19,797
-Open up.
-Perhaps this is the tea.

107
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:25,114
There's no need to wait, I am armed.

108
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:34,673
I'm sorry if they hurt you.

109
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:37,401
I lack the courage to interfere.

110
00:10:37,484 --> 00:10:41,079
But you did save me from becoming
the very first victim of a Dalek. Thank you.

111
00:10:41,164 --> 00:10:45,316
Yes, now you used that word earlier.
It had never been heard before.

112
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:48,996
And yet only an hour ago,
Davros announced that henceforth

113
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:52,918
his Mark III travel machine would be
referred to as a Dalek.

114
00:10:54,164 --> 00:10:56,314
Now how could you have known that?

115
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:58,679
Well, I have an advantage in terms of time.

116
00:10:58,764 --> 00:11:01,358
You see, we've come here at this time
because of future concern

117
00:11:01,444 --> 00:11:03,241
about the development of the Dalek.

118
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:06,122
I think you're concerned, too, aren't you?

119
00:11:07,724 --> 00:11:10,079
(WHISPERING) I think he's going to bite.

120
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:15,837
Yes, I am concerned and there are a few others
who think the same as I.

121
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:18,802
-But we're powerless.
-Then let us help you.

122
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:21,275
You see, we believe that

123
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:24,993
Davros has changed the direction of our research
into something which is...

124
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,040
immoral, evil.

125
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:31,324
You see, the Elite was formed

126
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:33,918
to produce weapons that would end this war.

127
00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:37,792
We soon saw that this was futile
and changed the direction of our research into...

128
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:40,114
into the survival of our race.

129
00:11:40,644 --> 00:11:44,523
But our chemical weapons had already
started to produce genetic mutations.

130
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,640
And the mutations were banished
out into the wastelands.

131
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:48,635
-Yes.
-The mutos.

132
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:53,563
Now Davros, he believed that there was
no way to reverse this trend

133
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:56,158
and so he started experiments

134
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:58,917
to establish our final mutational form.

135
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:02,315
He took living cells,

136
00:12:02,404 --> 00:12:04,964
treated them with chemicals and produced

137
00:12:05,044 --> 00:12:06,875
the ultimate creature.

138
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:10,916
Come with me.

139
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:29,596
Now this is what the Kaleds will become.

140
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,642
(GROWLING)

141
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:50,562
That is our future.

142
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:56,476
Go on, Ronson.

143
00:12:56,564 --> 00:13:00,842
Well, knowing our ultimate form,
Davros had to devise a travel machine.

144
00:13:00,924 --> 00:13:03,358
-The Dalek.
-Now he's trying to change that into a weapon.

145
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:05,241
And he's succeeding.

146
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:08,122
He's created a monster,
utterly devoid of conscience.

147
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,196
-And you want to stop him?
-Well, I must.

148
00:13:11,284 --> 00:13:15,357
There are a few in the Kaled government
who still have the power to act.

149
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:18,880
If they knew the truth,
they would end Davros' power,

150
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,273
close down this bunker, finish the only...

151
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:23,082
Then go to them, Ronson, go to them.

152
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:27,203
But I'm not allowed in the city.
Security here is absolute.

153
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:30,640
Then help us to escape. Give us the names
of the men who have the power.

154
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:32,919
Could you get us out of here?

155
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:34,801
There is a way.

156
00:13:34,884 --> 00:13:37,159
Through one of the secondary ducts
in the ventilation system

157
00:13:37,244 --> 00:13:39,235
that leads to a cave at the edge of the wasteland.

158
00:13:39,324 --> 00:13:42,873
-Well?
-The entrance is barred.

159
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:45,398
And there's something else.

160
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:48,442
Davros' early experiments were with animals.

161
00:13:48,804 --> 00:13:52,001
Some of the things that he created were horrific.

162
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:55,760
And they're still alive.

163
00:13:56,284 --> 00:14:00,277
And I have an uneasy feeling
you're going to tell me they're in that cave.

164
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:05,436
These are the people you should try to contact.

165
00:14:05,524 --> 00:14:06,752
Righto.

166
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:08,675
Look, if anything at all should happen...

167
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:12,200
-Don't worry, we won't let it fall into wrong hands.
-Quick.

168
01:14:26,204 --> 01:14:27,432
Come on.

169
01:14:43,524 --> 01:14:45,674
Here's where it comes out into the cave.

170
01:14:45,764 --> 01:14:47,800
(GROWLING)

171
01:14:47,884 --> 01:14:50,876
-What was that?
-Probably one of Davros' pets.

172
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:53,041
That's the alarm.
They'll be after us in a minute. Come on!

They're coming up after us.
You must keep moving. You must.

175
01:16:40,604 --> 01:16:43,437
I can't. I can't move.

176
01:16:43,924 --> 01:16:45,437
Come on. You must.

You will announce your name,

01:54:42,924 --> 01:54:45,313
and passed to Ronson for full interrogation.

189
01:54:45,404 --> 01:54:46,962
Yes, sir.

190
01:54:48,964 --> 01:54:50,443
Prisoner's belongings.

191
01:54:56,324 --> 01:54:58,713
Good, now he's gone, any chance of a cup of tea?

192
01:54:58,804 --> 01:54:59,953
What?

193
01:55:00,044 --> 01:55:02,512
Or coffee. My friend and I have had
a very trying experience.

194
01:55:02,604 --> 01:55:05,164
-Haven't we had a trying experience?
-Very trying, Doctor.

195
01:55:05,244 --> 01:55:07,963
Step into the security scan.

196
01:55:08,044 --> 01:55:09,796
What, no tea?

197
01:55:10,604 --> 01:55:14,392
Let me point out to you
that you have no rights whatsoever.

198
01:55:14,764 --> 01:55:17,915
I have full authority to torture
and kill any prisoner

199

who does not comply absolutely with my orders.

200
01:55:22,484 --> 01:55:25,635
That is your first and last warning.

201
01:55:26,204 --> 01:55:27,876
No tea, Harry.

You can't have that.

210
01:56:17,044 --> 01:56:19,683
That bracelet could have
no possible use as a weapon.

211
01:56:19,764 --> 01:56:22,722
It remains with the other confiscated items.

212
01:56:26,964 --> 01:56:28,795
Let's not make a fuss, Doctor.

213
01:56:28,884 --> 01:56:32,035
The time ring is our only hope
of getting back to the Tardis.

214
01:56:32,124 --> 01:56:35,958
Recovering it has got to be our number one
priority. Do you understand, Harry? It's vital.

215
01:56:36,044 --> 01:56:38,877
Yes, I know it's vital
but we don't want them to know that, do we?

216
01:56:38,964 --> 01:56:43,242
The prisoners are to be given into the custody
of Senior Researcher Ronson.

217
01:56:44,484 --> 01:56:45,837
Here...

218
01:56:46,364 --> 01:56:48,275
take this with you.

219
01:56:52,004 --> 01:56:53,153
Move.

220
01:56:57,044 --> 01:56:59,000
She's beautiful.

221
01:56:59,084 --> 01:57:00,403
No deformities.

222
01:57:01,084 --> 01:57:02,437
No imperfections.

223
01:57:08,124 --> 01:57:09,682
She is a norm.

224
01:57:10,124 --> 01:57:12,399
All norms are our enemies.

225
01:57:12,484 --> 01:57:15,123
Kill her now for what she's done to our kind.

226
01:57:15,204 --> 01:57:16,683
No, why?

227
01:57:16,764 --> 01:57:18,834
Why must we always destroy beauty?

228
01:57:18,924 --> 01:57:21,313
Why kill another creature
because it is not in our image?

229
01:57:21,404 --> 01:57:25,192
Kill her! It is the law. All norms must die.

230
01:57:25,364 --> 01:57:27,241
They are our enemies.

231
01:57:28,044 --> 01:57:30,114
And if you won't,

232
01:57:30,204 --> 01:57:32,081

233

There's something over there.

234
01:57:38,484 --> 01:57:40,918
It's a patrol, very close.

235
01:57:41,004 --> 01:57:42,722
Let's get away from here.

236
01:57:42,804 --> 01:57:46,001
No, they're too near. If you move, they'll see you.

237
01:57:46,084 --> 01:57:47,642
They're coming this way.

238
01:57:47,724 --> 01:57:50,682
-I'm going, come on.
-No, I tell you they'll see you.

239
01:57:52,524 --> 01:57:54,913
Halt. Stay where you are.

240
01:57:55,884 --> 01:57:58,159
Stand where you are and don't move.

(GUN FIRING)

242
01:58:07,324 --> 01:58:10,999
Ah, it's only a muto.
What a waste of good ammunition.

243
01:58:12,644 --> 01:58:14,760
There's a couple more of them.

244
01:58:15,564 --> 01:58:19,239
Hold it, if they are not too badly mutated,
we might be able to use them.

245
01:58:19,324 --> 01:58:21,884
They still need expendable labour
for the rocket loader.

246
01:58:26,244 --> 01:58:27,802
This one looks all right.

247
01:58:27,884 --> 01:58:30,079
Got all it needs to carry and walk.

248
01:58:31,204 --> 01:58:33,479
There's no reason why this one shouldn't work.

249
01:58:33,604 --> 01:58:35,356
Why, it's almost a norm.

250
01:58:35,444 --> 01:58:37,116
Come on, get up. Up.

251
01:58:37,844 --> 01:58:41,393
-Kill it off, it's too slow.
-No, it's all right. I'll help her.

252
01:58:42,364 --> 01:58:44,036
Then move and move quietly.

253
01:58:44,124 --> 01:58:46,001
There are Kaled patrols out tonight.

254
02:05:04,044 --> 02:05:05,955
Where are we?

255
02:05:06,044 --> 02:05:07,841
We're inside the Thal dome.

256
02:05:09,244 --> 02:05:11,519
We should be lucky to be alive.

257
02:05:11,604 --> 02:05:15,517
-The Thals normally kill on sight.
-Then why the change? Why bring us here?

258
02:05:16,924 --> 02:05:19,836
Perhaps they need slave workers for some project.

259
02:05:19,924 --> 02:05:21,755
The muto is right.

260
02:05:21,844 --> 02:05:24,199
The work they're making us do kills...

261
02:05:24,284 --> 02:05:26,752
with the same certainty
as a bullet between the eyes.

262
02:05:26,844 --> 02:05:29,881
-What work?
-The Thals have built a rocket.

263
02:05:30,284 --> 02:05:33,356
They've used up all their manpower and resources.

264
02:05:33,444 --> 02:05:36,914
They are gambling that it is going
to bring them victory in one blow.

265
02:05:37,004 --> 02:05:39,313
And if they can make the launch successfully,

266
02:05:39,404 --> 02:05:41,759
I don't see how they're going to fail.

267
02:05:41,844 --> 02:05:46,122
My race, the whole of the Kaled people,
will be wiped out in seconds.

268
02:05:47,044 --> 02:05:52,323
Perhaps we should be happy to welcome
such a weapon if it ends a thousand years of war.

269
02:05:52,484 --> 02:05:55,840
-You won't be when you find out what it is.
-Well, what is it?

270
02:05:56,484 --> 02:06:00,955
The nose cone of the rocket
is being packed with distronic explosive.

271
02:06:01,044 --> 02:06:03,399
-We have to put it in position.
-So?

272
02:06:03,484 --> 02:06:06,999
To reduce weight,
they're using no protective shielding.

273
02:06:07,284 --> 02:06:11,357
Every load we carry exposes us
to distronic toxaemia.

274
02:06:11,764 --> 02:06:15,074
After a few hours' exposure, we'll all be dead.

275
02:06:17,084 --> 02:06:19,882
We'd better think of something, hadn't we?

276
02:06:24,044 --> 02:06:25,443
Now what's happening?

277
02:06:25,524 --> 02:06:28,322
The rest period's over. We start loading again.

278
02:06:28,404 --> 02:06:31,953
I've have already done one load
since I was captured.

279
02:06:35,044 --> 02:06:37,239
All right, don't pu...sh.

280
03:11:00,044 --> 03:11:01,397
You've got troubles.

281
03:11:15,364 --> 03:11:17,719
We have to do something now.

282
03:11:18,524 --> 03:11:22,961
If we work another shift, we won't have
the strength to take any kind of action.

283
03:11:23,044 --> 03:11:25,399
Action? What do you mean?

284
03:11:25,484 --> 03:11:28,044
I mean we've got to get out of here.

285
03:11:28,484 --> 03:11:30,440
-It's not possible.
-Why?

286
03:11:30,884 --> 03:11:34,638
The guards are not expecting trouble from
a group of exhausted slave workers.

287
03:11:34,724 --> 03:11:38,194
So we get out into the rocket silo. Where then?

288
03:11:38,284 --> 03:11:41,037
The only other exit goes out through
a command point.

289
03:11:41,124 --> 03:11:43,922
And that's going to be crawling with Thal troops.

290
03:11:44,004 --> 03:11:45,995
There is another way.

291
03:11:46,084 --> 03:11:47,836
-Where?
-Straight up.

292
03:11:48,364 --> 03:11:51,754
The scaffolding. It goes right up
to the nose cone of the rocket.

293
03:11:51,844 --> 03:11:55,075
Now, if we could get up there,
then there's a chance

294
03:11:55,164 --> 03:11:58,201
we could get out onto the surface of the dome.

295
03:11:58,964 --> 03:12:01,558
It wouldn't be too difficult getting down again.

296
03:12:01,644 --> 03:12:04,033
The angle of the dome is quite gentle.

297
03:12:04,124 --> 03:12:05,876
That scaffolding!

298
03:12:05,964 --> 03:12:08,683
-I mean, it's so high.
-It's the only way.

299
03:12:08,764 --> 03:12:10,561
It's our only chance.

300
03:12:10,644 --> 03:12:13,204
I'd rather die taking a chance like that

301
03:12:13,284 --> 03:12:16,242
than rot away in here with distronic toxaemia.

302
03:12:19,644 --> 03:12:22,442
Okay, I'll pass the word to the others.
