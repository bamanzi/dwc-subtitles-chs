1
00:51:05,367 --> 00:51:07,642
Leela?

2
00:51:10,087 --> 00:51:12,476
Leela, are you all right?

3
00:51:12,647 --> 00:51:15,400
Oh, thank you, Doctor!

4
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:18,882
- Yes, I'm all right. Just bruised.
- You were lucky.

5
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:23,563
I deserve death. I had the chance
to kill our enemy and I failed.

6
00:51:23,727 --> 00:51:27,800
- Which enemy?
- The yellow one calls him ''lord''.

7
00:51:27,967 --> 00:51:31,926
He lives in a cage beneath
the theatre. Come, I will show you.

8
00:51:32,087 --> 00:51:33,878
(SCREECHING ROAR)

9
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:38,199
This gun takes about half an hour
to load. Let's go this way.

10
00:51:39,687 --> 00:51:42,838
Casey, I'm about to repair
for half a foot of port.

11
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:45,919
- Mrs Samuelson in yet?
- I've not seen her.

12
00:51:46,087 --> 00:51:49,318
Tell her I want the girls' frillies smartening up.

13
00:51:49,487 --> 00:51:53,241
Last night, one of 'em had
a Jacob's ladder as long as my arm!

14
00:51:53,407 --> 00:51:56,126
- You tell her!
- Yes, Mr Jago.

15
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:59,761
Oh! Mr Chang! Back again already?

16
00:51:59,927 --> 00:52:02,839
I shall have to start charging you rent, what?

17
00:52:03,007 --> 00:52:06,317
There is much to prepare
before the performance.

18
00:52:06,487 --> 00:52:10,275
Of course, Mr Chang, yes.
The art that conceals, eh?

19
00:52:10,447 --> 00:52:15,157
- Tell me, er... Last night...
- Last night?

20
00:52:15,327 --> 00:52:19,479
I'm working too hard - too much
in the old brainbox, that's a fact.

21
00:52:19,647 --> 00:52:23,959
We discussed a new contract,
but I've quite forgotten how we left matters.

22
00:52:24,127 --> 00:52:26,925
I'm considering your new offer.

23
00:52:27,087 --> 00:52:29,647
Ah, I see... Splendid.

24
00:52:29,807 --> 00:52:32,367
Generous offer?

25
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:34,722
Very reasonable.

26
00:52:36,087 --> 00:52:40,842
Tonight, incidentally,
I shall be appearing without Mr Sin.

27
00:52:41,007 --> 00:52:43,999
Why is that? Just making a change?

28
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:47,125
Mr Sin is indisposed.

29
00:52:47,287 --> 00:52:50,359
(LAUGHING) Oh, very droll!

30
00:52:50,527 --> 00:52:54,520
I shall treasure that exceedingly
humorous jest, Mr Chang!

31
00:52:55,687 --> 00:52:58,155
Oh, Mr Chang!

32
00:52:58,327 --> 00:53:02,559
I suppose the little fellow's
got a touch of woodworm, what?

33
00:53:04,927 --> 00:53:07,316
- Say that again!
- Hmm?

34
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:10,001
- Say that again!
- She was dead!

35
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:15,605
Her skin was dry like old leaves.
It was something the machine did to her.

36
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:20,887
Like old leaves? Sounds like
organic distillation - the life essence.

37
00:53:21,047 --> 00:53:23,038
That's what he called it.

38
00:53:23,207 --> 00:53:26,916
- He seemed to know all about it.
- He doesn't! He's a madman!

39
00:53:27,087 --> 00:53:32,036
- Here we are! Your outfit, my dear.
- Oh, thank you, Professor!

40
00:53:32,207 --> 00:53:36,758
No, no, not here! Mrs Hudson's upstairs.
She'll help you change.

41
00:53:37,927 --> 00:53:40,316
Hope it's suitable!

42
00:53:41,967 --> 00:53:44,925
- Dashed embarrassing business, eh?
- Hmm?

43
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,078
- Never done it before!
- What?

44
00:53:47,247 --> 00:53:51,798
Chosen togs for a girl.
You have to be careful it's in the right fashion!

45
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:54,276
- Clothes matter to women!
- They do?

46
00:53:54,447 --> 00:53:59,840
- Still trying to open it, are you?
- Yes. I'm trying to place the period.

47
00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:04,000
It can only be opened by a key
of the correct molecular combination.

48
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:07,159
What were you saying about a madman?

49
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,636
- He's probably got the key.
- Who?

50
00:54:09,807 --> 00:54:12,765
Presumably, he calls himself Weng-Chiang.

51
00:54:12,927 --> 00:54:18,604
- He was an ancient Chinese god.
- I know, and he probably arrived in this.

52
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:22,203
It was a gift to Mama
from his highness, T'ung-Chi.

53
00:54:22,367 --> 00:54:25,279
It's been in the family quite some years now.

54
00:54:25,447 --> 00:54:26,926
Then you're very lucky

55
00:54:27,087 --> 00:54:30,124
- he hasn't traced it before now.
- Weng-Chiang?

56
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:32,846
Do you like it?

57
00:54:34,007 --> 00:54:36,680
Yes, it's charming, isn't it, Professor?

58
00:54:36,847 --> 00:54:38,678
- Delightful!
- I'd be proud

59
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:42,760
- to take you the theatre in that!
- We're going to the theatre?

60
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:48,081
I have an appointment there,
and if you're good, I'll buy you an orange.

61
00:54:50,007 --> 00:54:52,157
- Any sign of the Doctor yet?
- Who?

62
00:54:52,327 --> 00:54:55,364
My collaborator and fellow sleuth.

63
00:54:55,527 --> 00:54:58,803
He'll be here tonight
keeping observation, Casey.

64
00:54:58,967 --> 00:55:02,004
(JAGO ) I'll lay a guinea to a gooseberry on it!

65
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:23,359
(LITEFOOT) Your cab's here.
(DOCTOR) Good.

66
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:27,918
You'll need your coats - it's getting thick again.

67
00:55:28,087 --> 00:55:30,726
Hmm. Did you pass word to the police?

68
00:55:30,887 --> 00:55:33,640
Yes. They've posted a man outside.

69
00:55:38,607 --> 00:55:41,838
Good. Lock and bolt the door
and keep your gun handy.

70
00:55:42,007 --> 00:55:44,760
You think those scoundrels will come back?

71
00:55:44,927 --> 00:55:47,680
They might. They want that cabinet.

72
00:55:51,687 --> 00:55:54,963
Don't you worry, Doctor. I'll be ready for them!

73
00:55:55,127 --> 00:55:57,721
They won't catch me napping a second time!

74
00:55:59,567 --> 00:56:02,559
Palace Theatre, cabby. Make it snappy.

75
00:56:02,727 --> 00:56:05,116
(CABBY) Go on!

76
00:56:14,487 --> 00:56:18,719
(KNOCKING ABOVE)

77
00:56:28,407 --> 00:56:31,285
- What is it?
- Your servant, Master.

78
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:35,599
Go away! I have work to attend to.

79
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:40,761
Lord, I have heard that the strange infidel,
the Doctor, will be here soon.

80
00:56:40,927 --> 00:56:43,919
Is it still your wish that I should kill him?

81
00:56:44,087 --> 00:56:47,397
I think it more likely that he will kill you.

82
00:56:47,567 --> 00:56:49,558
No, lord, I have plan.

83
00:56:49,727 --> 00:56:55,006
I will kill him as sacrifice
to appease the wrath of my god Weng-Chiang,

84
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:58,523
to prove that I, above all others,
am your true servant!

85
00:56:58,687 --> 00:57:00,882
You no longer serve me, Li H'sen.

86
00:57:01,047 --> 00:57:04,960
I shall take my own measures.
You do what you will. Now, go!

87
00:57:05,447 --> 00:57:09,838
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
it is my great privilege to introduce to you,

88
00:57:10,007 --> 00:57:13,044
in his extended season here at the Palace,

89
00:57:13,207 --> 00:57:15,767
the first of two appearances tonight -

90
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:20,523
someone whose legendary legerdemain

91
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:24,885
has entranced and entertained
all the crowned heads of Europe.

92
00:57:25,047 --> 00:57:27,356
Here, to baffle and bewilder

93
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:33,045
in his eclectic extravaganza
of efflorescent ectoplasm -

94
00:57:33,207 --> 00:57:38,440
that master magician
from the Orient, Li H'sen Chang!

95
00:57:38,607 --> 00:57:42,122
(APPLAUSE)

96
00:58:12,927 --> 00:58:16,636
Will someone pick cards, please?

97
00:58:18,967 --> 00:58:21,117
You, sir, catchee!

98
00:58:25,007 --> 00:58:30,286
Now, sir, please to assist
humble Chang by selecting any card.

99
00:58:33,687 --> 00:58:39,603
(CHANG) Ace of diamonds.
Please to hold card in air so everyone see.

100
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:44,238
Now, sir, please to return card
to pack any place.

101
00:58:46,087 --> 00:58:53,038
Honourable gentleman please to hold
cards between finger and thumb.

102
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:59,760
Chang will now shoot magic bullet
through ace of diamonds

103
00:58:59,927 --> 00:59:03,317
without hitting other cards.

104
00:59:03,487 --> 00:59:07,162
Please to keep very still.

105
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:09,318
Doctor!

106
00:59:13,567 --> 00:59:17,765
- (HORRIFIED GASPS)
- Please to keep very quiet!

107
00:59:17,927 --> 00:59:21,556
Chang shoot 15 peasants learning this trick!

108
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:30,157
Now, sir, please to look for ace of diamonds!

109
00:59:38,247 --> 00:59:42,206
Oh, very good! Wasn't that good?
Anything else?

110
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:46,360
Honourable gentleman
please to bring cards to stage.

111
00:59:46,527 --> 00:59:52,443
I have further demonstration
requiring nerves of steel!

112
01:00:06,247 --> 01:00:08,522
(DOG BARKING)

113
01:00:59,487 --> 01:01:02,206
(APPLAUSE)

114
01:01:08,087 --> 01:01:11,284
I will now ask my eager volunteer

115
01:01:11,447 --> 01:01:14,723
to step into the Cabinet of Death!

116
01:01:14,887 --> 01:01:20,166
(DRUM ROLL)

117
01:01:28,847 --> 01:01:31,486

118
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,638
(MAN) Behind ya!

119
01:01:40,687 --> 01:01:45,363
The bird has flown. One of us is yellow (!)

(DRUM ROLL)

122
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:00,998
If you will now pay close attention,
ladies and gentlemen!

123
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:44,880
So, the great magician (!)

124
01:02:46,287 --> 01:02:50,485
In my country, this is known
as the death of a thousand cuts!

125
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:27,446
I will now ask my new volunteer
kindly to assist in opening the cabinet!

126
01:03:32,247 --> 01:03:34,761
(AUDIENCE GASPS)

127
01:03:35,447 --> 01:03:37,483
Quick, drop the curtain!

128
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,638
What's happened?

129
01:03:39,807 --> 01:03:42,719
He's dead. He died of a fright.

130
01:03:42,887 --> 01:03:47,165
Poor Casey! He's worked here for years!

131
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:50,876
Doctor, what happened? Did Chang kill him?

132
01:03:51,047 --> 01:03:55,723
No, Chang was as surprised
as anyone. Where's he gone?

133
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:05,516
Are you here, Master?
This is your servant, Li H'sen.

134
01:04:20,767 --> 01:04:23,440
Answer me, lord!

135
01:04:25,607 --> 01:04:28,075
If you're here, answer!

136
01:04:32,007 --> 01:04:34,396
He has gone.

137
01:04:35,687 --> 01:04:40,522
Weng-Chiang, lord of greatness,
has deserted me!

138
01:04:41,687 --> 01:04:45,202
- Lord?
- You've been left to carry the can, Chang!

139
01:04:47,607 --> 01:04:50,917
No poison tonight,
there are questions to answer!

140
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:56,798
I will say nothing. It is time
for me to join my forefathers.

141
01:04:56,967 --> 01:05:01,802
Well, the police shouldn't hold you up long.
Where did Weng-Chiang go?

142
01:05:01,967 --> 01:05:06,677
Perhaps back to his great palace in the sky.

143
01:05:06,847 --> 01:05:10,726
I failed him. He was displeased with me.

144
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:12,878
His mind is broken.

145
01:05:13,047 --> 01:05:16,278
Li H'sen, you know he's not a god, don't you?

146
01:05:16,447 --> 01:05:19,280
He came like a god.

147
01:05:19,447 --> 01:05:23,406
He appeared in a blazing cabinet of fire.

148
01:05:23,567 --> 01:05:29,563
I saw him and helped him.
He was tired from his journey.

149
01:05:29,727 --> 01:05:34,278
- Go on.
- He was ill for many months.

150
01:05:34,447 --> 01:05:36,836
I was but a humble peasant,

151
01:05:37,007 --> 01:05:41,717
but I gave him sanctuary
while the soldiers searched. I nursed him.

152
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:45,118
The cabinet! What happened to the cabinet?

153
01:05:45,287 --> 01:05:48,324
The soldiers of T'ung-Chi took it.

154
01:05:49,887 --> 01:05:54,597
Ever since, we have searched
for the great cabinet of Weng-Chiang.

155
01:05:54,767 --> 01:05:59,477
The god will not be made whole
until it is recovered.

156
01:05:59,647 --> 01:06:02,286
(JAGO ) Doctor, are you down here?

157
01:06:02,447 --> 01:06:06,440
Cover me in creosote,
I never knew this was here!

158
01:06:06,607 --> 01:06:08,598
(LEELA) Doctor!

159
01:06:10,487 --> 01:06:12,762
- No, Leela.
- But he's escaping!

160
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:17,205
There's no escape that way.
He's gone to join his ancestors.

in all these Machiavellian machinations?

a new act tomorrow.

all over again somewhere else!
