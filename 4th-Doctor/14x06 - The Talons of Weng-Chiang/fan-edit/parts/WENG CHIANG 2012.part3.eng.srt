00:33:48,088 --> 00:33:49,885
- Doctor!
- Sh!

3
00:33:50,048 --> 00:33:51,401
Doctor...

4
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:55,239

5
00:34:01,608 --> 00:34:03,599
Where's Litefoot?

6
00:34:03,768 --> 00:34:07,647
He went out. He said he'd seen
a Chinaman outside the window.

7
00:34:07,808 --> 00:34:09,639
And you jumped through it!

8
00:34:09,808 --> 00:34:12,197
- Something like that.
- Stay here!

9
00:34:46,408 --> 00:34:48,000
Leela!

10
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:50,682
Leela, no! Don't!

11
00:34:50,848 --> 00:34:52,725
Leela...

12
00:34:53,888 --> 00:34:57,005
- Ice!
- The sheer criminal effrontery!

13
00:34:57,168 --> 00:34:59,557
Things are coming to a pretty pass

14
00:34:59,728 --> 00:35:02,845
when ruffians will attack
a man in his own home!

15
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:05,397
Well, they WERE Chinese ruffians.

16
00:35:05,568 --> 00:35:08,207
- I wonder what they intended?
- Robbery?

17
00:35:08,368 --> 00:35:13,317
Well, there are some valuable things here.
That K'ang-hsi vase, for instance.

18
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:17,879
My family brought that back
from Peking. Or that Chinese puzzle box.

19
00:35:20,048 --> 00:35:24,121
It doesn't open. A chap spent a week
looking for a secret spring.

20
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,439
- Fused molecules.
- No, lacquered bronze!

21
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:30,281
Extraordinary! It's from this planet!

22
00:35:30,448 --> 00:35:34,441
- A parting gift from the emperor.
- Technology this advanced?

23
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:37,600
Ah! Got it!

24
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:41,204
- That's the answer!
- What are you raving about, Doctor?

25
00:35:41,368 --> 00:35:43,757
- Weng-Chiang!
- Weng-Chiang?

26
00:35:43,928 --> 00:35:46,488
I do hope that girl Leela isn't in danger.

You will explain yourself, Li H'sen!

28
00:36:33,488 --> 00:36:36,286
I will not tolerate failure!

29
00:36:36,448 --> 00:36:40,839
- There has been no failure, lord.
- Then where is the time cabinet?

30
00:36:41,008 --> 00:36:45,160
The house is marked.
When night returns, my brothers will strike!

31
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,923
I put no trust in your dockyard riffraff!

32
00:36:49,088 --> 00:36:52,160
Lord, for your glory, they would die willingly!

33
00:36:52,328 --> 00:36:56,082

Lord, I promise you shall have
the great cabinet of Weng-Chiang

36
00:37:04,648 --> 00:37:07,720
- before another dawn.
- I had better!

37
00:37:07,888 --> 00:37:10,800
I grow weary of this hole in the ground!

38
00:37:10,968 --> 00:37:14,847
- You are safe here, lord.
- Safe?! It is a trap,

39
00:37:15,008 --> 00:37:17,238
and I was seen returning to it!

40
00:37:17,408 --> 00:37:20,400
- Tonight?
- Yes! And now he knows where I am,

41
00:37:20,568 --> 00:37:22,559
- he will be back!
- Who?

42
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:25,800
By your description, the one you failed to kill!

43
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:27,483
The Doctor! 

44
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:34,043
- Haven't you slept?
- Sleep is for tortoises.

45
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,483
- Any news of Miss Leela?
- Not yet.

46
00:37:36,648 --> 00:37:41,324
- Should we inform the police?
- No. They already have nine missing girls.

47
00:37:41,488 --> 00:37:45,197
Yes, but missing
under very different circumstances!

48
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:47,836
No. I think I know what they were used for,

49
00:37:48,008 --> 00:37:50,363
and I can't imagine a more grisly fate.

50
00:37:50,528 --> 00:37:52,439
- He's a blackguard!
- Who is?

51
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:57,398
I don't know, but some vampire
stalks this city at night - he's a blackguard!

52
00:37:57,568 --> 00:38:01,766
I've got to find his lair
and I haven't got an hour to lose. Look.

53

Yes, yes, the Doctor is a danger,

54
00:38:06,948 --> 00:38:10,099

by your blundering!

55
00:38:10,268 --> 00:38:12,657
You see what it means, Li H'sen?

56
00:38:12,828 --> 00:38:15,217
He will die!

57
00:38:15,388 --> 00:38:18,107
The list of your failures is growing!

58
00:38:18,268 --> 00:38:23,422
I must be ready to move quickly -
I need strength!

59
00:38:23,588 --> 00:38:28,378
- I will bring a girl, lord.
- One will not be enough this time.

60
00:38:28,548 --> 00:38:33,144
I need two fresh young donors,
and I need them at once!

61
00:38:33,308 --> 00:38:36,266
- It is not easy at this hour, lord.
- No excuses!

62
00:38:36,428 --> 00:38:38,419
Get them!

63
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:42,544
I've been trying to trace
the line of the sewers.

64
00:38:42,608 --> 00:38:46,199
That's the Thames, this is the line of the Fleet,

65
00:38:46,488 --> 00:38:49,082
and that is the Palace Theatre.

66
00:38:49,248 --> 00:38:52,957

- Mmm.

- Used for duck mainly.
- Made in Birmingham -

that's the main requirement.
Could you get me a boat?

94
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:35,245
I imagine so. What is the purpose of all this?

95
00:42:35,408 --> 00:42:39,003
To find the confluence
of the Thames and the Fleet, Professor.

96
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:42,285
- And then?
- And then we shall see.

extremely rash and ill-considered!

Explode? Unthinkable.
It was made in Birmingham!

108
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:32,242
Tie up over there, skipper.

- Are they unsuitable, lord?
