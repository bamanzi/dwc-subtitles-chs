1
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:08,696
There's a Boot Court near the river,
less than a mile from here, look.

2
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:13,894
Oh, you let yourself in,
that's good. We were expecting you.

3
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:17,655
No, Doctor,
it was WE who were expecting YOU!

4
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:21,779
Life's full of little surprises.
What have you done to her?

5
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:26,536
- Nothing...yet!
- Take my advice - don't!

6
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,213
Your advice (?)

7
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:32,532
(HE LAUGHS)
Oh, Doctor, you are an unusual man,

8
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:36,249
but in opposing me, you have gone
far out of your depth!

9
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:39,890
You have taken something from me.
I want it back!

10
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:42,733
Now, I wonder what that could be?

11
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:47,212
I'm always borrowing things
and then forgetting where I put them!

12
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,911
Hmm...

13
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:55,048
It's a terrible habit!

14
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,272
I have never appreciated frivolity!

15
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:02,115
It was in that bag,
it is not there now. Give it to me!

16
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:05,670
- Want one of these?
- The time key, Doctor!

17
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,990
Oh, the time key!

18
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,913
Heavens to Betsy, where did I last see that?

19
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:15,073
I'll give you three seconds
and then Mr Sin will kill the girl!

20
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:17,754
One, two, three! KILL HER!

21
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:22,789
- Stop!
- Is this what you want?

22
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,394
- The trionic lattice?
- Give it to me!

23
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,792
- Careful! I might have dropped it!
- I'll kill you!

24
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:35,556
Crystalline. It'd probably break
into a thousand pieces!

25
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:39,659
- You arrogant jackanapes!
- When I'm crowded I get nervous.

26
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:43,210
- Back! Back!
- That's better.

27
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:47,891
Give me that key and I will spare her life!

28
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:51,177
Never trust a man with dirty fingernails!

29
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:54,730
You can trust me to kill her
if you do not put it down!

30
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:58,973
- Obey me at once!
- I'll make a bargain with you.

31
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:04,692
You can have the trionic lattice...
when we get to the House of the Dragon.

32
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:07,055
What trickery is this?

33
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:09,609
You're holding two other friends.

34
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:12,931
- What of them?
- I want them released.

35
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,011
Two blundering dolts! Why?

36
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,375
I doubt if you could understand that,

37
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:21,533
- but that's the condition.
- Very well. They're nothing to me!

38
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:23,099
Good.

39
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:28,015
Right then, you and your chaps
can lead the way and I'll follow.

40
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:32,492
- Bring the girl!
- No! The girl stays.

41
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:35,379
You would be wise not to press me too far!

42
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:37,895
Just lead on!

43
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:41,089
Come!

44
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:28,018
- What's the matter?
- I heard something.

45
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:31,172
- What sort of thing?
- People.

46
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,900
Quite a group just went by.

47
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:37,891
More Wongs for the Tong, I suppose!

48
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:42,450
Do you realise we've been here over an hour?

49
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:47,250
- It'll be the dawn soon.
- What does that signify?

50
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:51,572
I'm not aware it signifies anything.
It's just a remark.

51
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:55,130
I thought perhaps
they might do things at dawn.

52
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:57,291
Do things? What sort of things?

53
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:59,690
You know - sacrifice their victims.

54
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,852
You're thinking of the Druids, aren't you?

55
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:06,092
I'm not aware the Chinese
make a ceremony of it.

56
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:08,979
Good. I don't think I could stomach that.

57
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:13,213
- It's been worrying me somewhat.
- Best not to think about it.

58
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:17,178
I can't help it. Beastly heathens!

59
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:20,730
- That's my trouble, Litefoot.
- What?

60
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,970
Well, I'm not awfully...

61
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:27,258
I'm not so bally brave when it comes to it.
I try, but I'm not.

62
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:30,617
When it comes to it, I don't suppose anybody is!

63
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:35,296
Well, I thought I ought to tell you
anyway, in case I let the side down.

64
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:39,453
You won't, Henry, I know you won't.

65
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:45,416
(WENG-CHIANG) Fetch the prisoners here!

66
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,939
Very impressive!

67
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,773
- I'll have the bird's nest soup!
- What?

68
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:05,659
Well, isn't this where you do the cooking?

69
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:14,370
How can you understand the functions
of a catalytic extraction chamber?

70
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:16,895
Technology far beyond your time!

71
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:21,019
Simple cannibalism! That machine
gets rid of the grisly bits.

72
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:25,059
Much more than that! The secret of life!

73
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:30,692
Your so-called technology
is the twisted lunacy of a scientific dark age!

74
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:35,456
- What do you know of my time?
- Everything!

75
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,497
- Where is it?
- What?

76
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:40,891
Your pig-faced,
pig-brained Peking Homunculus.

77
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:44,859
(WENG-CHIANG) You know of that? How?!

78
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:52,813
I was with the Filipino army
at the final advance on Reykjavik.

79
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:58,259
How can you in the 19th century
know anything of the 51st? You lie!

80
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:01,059
Listen... What's your name?

81
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:04,895
What were you called
before you became a Chinese god?

82
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:07,938
I am Magnus Greel!

83
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:14,977
Oh, yes... The infamous Minister of Justice!

84
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:20,173
The Butcher of Brisbane. Checkmate.

85
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:23,412
It's impossible for you to know these things!

86
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:28,813
I know you're a wanted criminal
and that 100,000 deaths can be laid at your door.

87
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:33,053
Enemies of the state! They were used
in the advancements of science!

88
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:36,496
They were slaughtered in your filthy machine!

89
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:39,970
So...you ARE from the future,

90
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:45,009
and I, for all my achievements,
am only remembered as a war criminal!

91
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:49,378
Of course, it is the winning side
that writes history, Doctor (!)

92
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:53,089
Remember, you would not be here
if it were not for my work!

93
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:55,251
Your work (?)

94
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:59,338
- (PIG-LIKE GRUNTS)
- Your work (?)

95
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:03,891
Yes! I made this possible!
I found the resources, the scientists...

96
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:07,894
The zigma experiments were a failure.
Nothing came of them!

97
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:12,770
No! They were a success!
I used them to escape from my enemies!

98
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:17,889
- The first man to travel through time!
- Hmm, look what it did to you!

99
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:23,339
A temporal distortion
of my metabolism. It can be readjusted!

100
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,617
- Doctor!
- Good morning, gentlemen!

101
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:29,010
What did I tell you? The game's up!

102
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:33,378
- We have the place surrounded!
- We don't have the place surrounded.

103
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:36,691
- We just have an understanding.
- Understanding?

104
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:39,294
I have kept my word. Give me the key!

105
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:41,769
Only when they've gone. Hurry!

106
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:44,135
There are two wretched girls here.

107
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:47,975
- Take them with you.
- Your demands are becoming too great!

108
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:53,695
Enough! I want him alive!

109
01:27:55,740 --> 01:28:00,256
- Beware the eye of the dragon!
- Doctor, are you hurt?

110
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:05,858
Take them out! Get these stinking
heaps of rubbish out of here!/

111
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:20,931
(STRANGLED CRY)

112
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:33,490
Perfect! Perfect! After all these years,
the function is unimpaired!

113
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:40,076
Everything exactly as it was -
the parallax synchron fully charged,

114
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,276
the strata tube set at maximum!

115
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:45,955
(TRIUMPHANT LAUGH)
He was wrong! Wrong!

116
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:49,635
The zigma experiment WAS a success!/

117
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,677
- Doctor, are you all right?
- Greel's got the key!

118
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:57,116
- How long have I been unconscious?
- Only a few minutes.

119
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,320
- The broth of oblivion.
- What's that?

120
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,630
A Chinese soup.

121
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:11,518
- He'll be coming for them soon.
- There must be something we can do!

122
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,468
There's always something we can do.
Get them against the wall./

123
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:25,519
Almost ready!
Yes, time to prepare my two partridges!

124
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,910
Why don't you come down from there?

125
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:33,278
Sulking because I wouldn't let you
kill the Doctor, is that it?

126
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:40,152
Before you kill him, I must drain every scintilla
of his knowledge about the zigma experiment!

127
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,231
(PIG-LIKE GRUNTS)

128
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:46,473
You can kill him then, and as many
more as you wish, before we leave!

129
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:49,950
All I need is to re-establish
my proteinoid balance,

130
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,510
then I can enter the zigma beam
for the second time.

131
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:58,754
Only this time, there must be
no mistake in the programme DNA levels!

132
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,036
Now for my two partridges!

133
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,589
Die, Bent Face!

134
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:09,432
No! Spare me, please!

135
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,909
Spawn of evil! Now I destroy you!

136
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:23,037
The second time! The second attempt
on my life by this she-devil!

137
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,838
Hold her still!

138
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:30,555
No... No, I have a better fate for you!

139
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:36,155
She will be the first morsel
to feed my regeneration!

140
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:40,632
Kill me any way you wish!
Unlike you, I am not afraid to die!

141
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,031
We shall see! Bring the tigress here!

142
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:49,115
At my camps, the extraction process
was considered the most painful of all.

143
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:51,555
They pleaded for anything but this!

144
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,314
I shall not plead, but I promise you this -

145
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:58,871
when we are in the great hereafter,
I shall hunt you down, Bent Face,

146
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:02,157
and put you through my agony a thousand times!

147
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,958
Silence! Now get the other hags!

148
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,039
(HISSING)

149
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,509
(JAGO ) It's leaking, I can smell it!

150
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:13,513
(LITEFOOT) There's bound to be some escape.

151
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:15,989
(DOCTOR) Not enough to worry about.

152
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:21,314
I'm not worried, but I'd hate to be gassed
before seeing if this stunt works!

153
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:24,631
Well, Greel won't keep us waiting long.

154
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,633
- He needs his proteinoids.
- His what?

155
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:30,394
He's dying. His body's fading away fast.

156
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,633
He's trying to cheat death
by substituting certain materials.

157
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,588
- Do you understand?
- I think so, the principle anyway.

158
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:42,150
All he achieves is a postponement
of the inevitable.

159
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,311
Sh!

160
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,869
(DISTANT SHOUTING IN CHINESE)

161
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,031
Lucifers, Professor.

162
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,598
Quick! Get over there!

163
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:03,671
Listen, if we do manage to get
out of here, don't stop running

164
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,229
until you're a mile from this place.

165
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:26,269
Up troops and at 'em, eh, Professor?

01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:49,232
(DOCTOR) Come on! Come on! Quickly!

168
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,235
This way! Quickly!

169
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:01,870
(WENG-CHIANG) Whatever it was,
there can be no escape for you!

170
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:06,955
Let the talons of Weng-Chiang shred your flesh!

(HUMMING WHINE)

172
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:17,517
Greel!

173
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:26,274
- Kill, Sin! Kill them!

174
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:28,476
Get down! Get down!/

(TRILLING LASER)

176
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:45,530
Hurry, Sin! There is little time left to me!

177
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:50,452
It's no good, Greel, you're finished.

178
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:53,976
I can escape you
as I escaped my enemies before!

179
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:59,612
Listen, if you activate the zigma beam,
it will be certain death for all of us!

180
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:04,058
- Lies, Doctor!
- (DOCTOR) Listen, Greel!

181
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:07,371
GREEL, LISTEN!
The zigma beam is at full stretch.

182
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:12,216
If you trigger it again,
it will collapse. You know what that means?

183
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:14,336
(GREEL) You can't fool me!

184
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:17,651
There'll be a huge implosion
with you at the centre!

185
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:20,209
The zigma experiments were a disaster!

186
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:23,929
No! No, the zigma experiment was a success!

187
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:26,295
A brilliant, total success!

188
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:30,812
Agh! Sin, what are you doing?!

189
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:34,689
- (TRILLING LASER)
- I order you to... No, no, not me!

190
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:36,691
This is mutiny, Sin!

193
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:04,538
Is Bent Face dead?

194
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:08,295
- Why do you call him Bent Face?
- Because it is. No, don't!

(CRACKLING RUSTLE)

196
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:15,768
(DOCTOR) Cellular collapse.

197
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:20,138
In all my years as a pathologist,
I've never seen anything like it!

198
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:23,815
(DOCTOR) Let's hope you never see
anything like it again.

199
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:28,053
- Where was he from? Where did he go?
- He was a foe from the future.

200
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:30,688
(DOCTOR) Look out, Leela!

201
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:48,355
- (JAGO ) What's that?
- It's his fuse, Henry.

202
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:50,795
What are you doing, Doctor?

203
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,191
I'm bringing the zigma experiment to an end.

204
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:04,153
- Listen.
- <i>Get your hot muffinsI</i>

205
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:08,632
- <i>Hot muffinsI</i>
- It's the muffin man.

206
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:11,758
Come on. I'll buy you some muffins.

207
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:19,911
And then, for example, I would say,
''One lump or two, Miss Leela?''

208
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:23,914
To which you would reply,
''One will suffice, thank you!''

209
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:27,675
- Do you follow?
- Supposing I want two?

210
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,230
- No, no. One lump for ladies!
- Then why do you ask me?

211
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,914
(DOCTOR) Come along!

212
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:37,675
Professor Litefoot has been
explaining to me about tea.

213
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:41,389
- It's very complicated!
- It's not complicated at all.

214
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:45,075
All you... I haven't time
to stand here discussing tea.

215
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:47,959
- Goodbye, Litefoot.
- Goodbye, Doctor!

216
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:51,032
- It's been such fun! Henry...
- Goodbye!

217
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:57,874
(DOCTOR) Yes, the important thing
is just warming the pot.

218
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:03,034
- What exactly IS that contraption?
- His personal transport - look, ''Police''!

219
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,919
- (WHOOSHING)
- Extraordinary!

220
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:08,992
No doubt Scotland Yard provided it for him!

221
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:13,199
(WHOOSHING)

222
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:17,671
- I don't believe it!
- I've said it before and I'll say it again -

223
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,796
our policemen are wonderful!

224
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:23,316
- But it's impossible! Quite impossible!
- Good trick, eh?

225
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,948
Li H'sen Chang himself
would have appreciated that!
