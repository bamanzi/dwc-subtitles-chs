He was fished from the river,
but he wasn't drowned.

132
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:33,997
- Those marks suggest an animal.
- Exactly what I think,

133
00:13:34,168 --> 00:13:37,319

That's impossible. Look at the size of them.

00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:45,402
Have you established the cause of death?

137
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:49,561
That's another curious thing -
all this happened after death.

138
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,879
He was killed by a knife blow to the heart.

00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:56,883
- Are those his clothes?
- Yes, sir.

140

- I'm taking them for examination.
- Hold that.

141
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:05,002
He was carrying no personal documents,

142
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:08,558
but this indicates he was a licensed cab driver.

143
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:10,878

- Some sort of hair.

- Yes, I think they're rat hairs.

147
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:27,240
- Rat hairs?! Do you know what you're saying?
- Of course I know what I'm saying.

148
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:31,681
It's three inches long -
hairs on a rat are only a quarter of an inch.

- Yes, a lady's glove,

Perhaps the ghost dropped it, eh?

19
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:37,552
Come on. We've had enough of your spook!

20
00:15:37,364 --> 00:15:39,514
(JAGO ) Go on home. Straight home.

21
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:42,596
You might get mistaken for one of those girls!

22
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:45,198
- Aren't you coming, Mr Jago?
- Not yet.

23
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:47,798
Some paperwork commands my presence,

24
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:51,639
but I shall doubtless descry
those lugubrious liniments

25
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:53,795
- at the crepuscular hour!
- Eh?

26
00:15:53,964 --> 00:15:55,955
See you in the morning!

27
00:15:56,124 --> 00:15:59,002
You're a card, Mr Jago, a card and a half!

28
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:07,242
Jiminy, you made me jump!
I thought you'd gone, Mr Chang!

29
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:10,157
No, Mr Jago, I have come back to see you.

30
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:13,839
See me, Mr Chang? Nothing wrong, I hope!

31
00:16:14,004 --> 00:16:18,236
Be so kind as to step up
to my dressing room and I will explain.

32
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:25,914
If it's the terms of our contract,

33
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:28,678
we've been attracting such good houses,

34
00:16:28,844 --> 00:16:31,914
I've already considered
drawing up a fresh agreement,

35
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:36,557
with terms that no other management
in London would offer an artiste!

36
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:41,195
What would you say to an extra
two per cent? Gross, naturally.

37
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:44,993
I think you'll agree that's...fair.

38
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:48,440
Now hear me, Jago.

39
00:16:48,604 --> 00:16:52,643
You remember the cab driver, Buller,
who came to see me tonight?

40
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,079
Cab driver? Yes.

41
00:16:55,244 --> 00:17:01,160
I want you to forget him,
understand? You did not see him.

42
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:03,121
I did not see him.

43
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:05,275
Good.

44
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:08,436
Now you will go from here to your office.

45
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:12,438
When you sit down at your desk,
you will remember only

46
00:17:12,604 --> 00:17:16,916
that you have just said goodnight
to Casey. Is that clear?

47
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:20,235
I have just said goodnight to Casey.

48
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:24,079
Excellent. Now, go!

49
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:44,436
- You are late!
- We should not go tonight, lord.

50
00:18:44,604 --> 00:18:49,075
I must - every night
until the time cabinet is found!

51
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:50,757
You are ill!

52
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:53,916
I am dying, Chang!

53
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:58,953
You must bring another linnet to my cage.

54
00:18:59,124 --> 00:19:02,355
- But only yesterday...
- The disease grows worse!

55
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:05,994
Each distillation lasts less than the time before!

56
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:11,443
And with every missing girl, panic increases.
I fear one will be traced here.

57
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:13,799
You must be careful!

58
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:16,194
There is always risk of discovery.

59
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,356
Even tonight I acted quickly to keep our secret.

60
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:23,802
- A man was on his way to police!
- Hah! Those dumb-witted oxen!

61
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:29,755
I have given you mental powers
undreamt of in this century!

62
00:19:29,924 --> 00:19:32,722
You are thousands of years ahead of your time.

63
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:37,400
- Why fear these primitives?
- True, I read their minds with ease,

64
00:19:37,564 --> 00:19:41,762
but tonight there was a man
whose thoughts were hidden.

65
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:44,313
- Describe him!
- He is a doctor - tall,

66
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:48,636
wide, pale eyes and hair that curls
like the ram. He ask many questions.

67
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:53,594
A time ancient would not ask questions!
A time ancient would know!

68
00:19:53,764 --> 00:19:56,517
I fear danger, and have sent a man to kill him.

69
00:19:56,684 --> 00:20:01,599
Your opium-addicted scum are bunglers!
You should have done it yourself!

70
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:05,677
If he troubles us further, lord,
I will deal with him personally.

71
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:07,960
Very well. We're wasting time. Come!

72
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:12,276
I took some organs for further tests,
but I admit to being beaten.

73
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,435
- Beaten?
- They were poisoned,

74
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:17,038
one orally, the other intravenously.

75
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:20,037
I understand you suggested scorpion venom?

76
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:24,243
- Yes, in concentrated form.
- Hmm, you're in this line, I take it?

77
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:26,237
- I've dabbled a bit.

78
00:20:26,884 --> 00:20:30,274
- What an amazing night it's been!
- It is not over yet.

79
00:20:30,444 --> 00:20:33,436
Most of the corpses around here are jolly dull.

80
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:35,595
Now I have two inscrutable Chinks

81
00:20:35,764 --> 00:20:38,597
and a poor perisher
who was chewed by a giant rat,

82
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:42,154
- having been stabbed by a midget!
- A midget?

83
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,803
Angle of the wound!

84
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:46,478
We shouldn't be discussing such things

85
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:49,795
in front of the fairer sex! Forgive us, ma'am!

86
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:52,273
- What for?
- For being so indelicate

87
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:54,958
in the presence of a lady of refinement!

88
00:20:55,124 --> 00:20:57,433
- Does he mean me?
- I don't think so.

89
00:20:57,604 --> 00:21:00,641
You say you can tell the height of the attacker

90
00:21:00,804 --> 00:21:02,920
by the way the blade was thrust,

91
00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:05,075
but when aiming for the heart,

92
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:08,281
we were taught to strike under the breastbone.

93
00:21:08,444 --> 00:21:10,639
Upon my soul!

94
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:14,877
Savage. Found floating
down the Amazon in a hat box!

95
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:18,400
- A hat box?
- (POLICEMAN) Professor, still here?

96
00:21:18,564 --> 00:21:23,433
I've traced our cab driver -
Joseph Buller, 14 Fish Lane, this parish.

97
00:21:23,604 --> 00:21:28,120
Splendid. You can tell the coroner.
Will someone identify the clothing?

98
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:32,755
His mother-in-law, Nelly Gusset.
Same address. Deceased has lived there

99
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:36,234
- since his marriage six month ago.
- Anything else?

100
00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:38,793
You had a few drinks with Mrs Gusset.

101
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:43,196
- Did she tell you anything further?
- A bearer of sad tidings, sir.

102
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:47,357
I shared a glass or two
while the poor thing got over the shock.

103
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:51,756
She did mention that the deceased
had been in a queer state all day.

104
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:53,403
Why?

105
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:57,034
It seems his wife, Emma Buller,
daughter of the house,

106
00:21:57,204 --> 00:21:59,195
didn't come home last night.

107
00:21:59,364 --> 00:22:04,199
Deceased had several drinks
and went round to the Palace Theatre.

108
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:08,482
- The theatre?
- Oh, not on pleasure bent, sir.

109
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:12,432
It seems he believed
that's where his wife was to be found.

110
00:22:12,604 --> 00:22:16,199
Mrs Gusset says he went off
making horrible asseverations

111
00:22:16,364 --> 00:22:17,763
as to his intentions.

112
00:22:17,924 --> 00:22:22,122
Well, put as much in the report
as you think will concern the coroner.

113
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:25,082
It's quite clear the man got stupidly drunk

114
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:28,156
and picked a fight with a dwarf!

115
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:30,679
Yes, sir.

116
00:22:30,844 --> 00:22:34,120
A night's work like that
does wonders for my appetite.

117
00:22:34,284 --> 00:22:37,594
- How about some supper?
- I'd be delighted.

118
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:47,039
The police will have the Buller case
cleared up in no time,

119
00:22:47,204 --> 00:22:50,355
but the Chinese, different kettle of fish, what?

120
00:22:50,524 --> 00:22:52,913
Why are you making fire in your mouth?

121
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:55,552
Hasn't the girl seen a pipe before?

122
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:58,716
There's no tobacco where Leela comes from.

123
00:22:58,884 --> 00:23:01,796
Sounds healthy but exceedingly dull!

124
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,798
Yes, as I was saying,
they're a mysterious lot, the Chinese.

125
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:10,116
Enigmatic. I've never understood them,
and I was brought up in China.

126
00:23:10,284 --> 00:23:12,752
Really? What were you doing there?

127
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:17,475
My father was Brigadier General
in the punitive expedition of 1860,

128
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:20,477
then he stayed in Peking as a palace attach�.

129
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:22,635
He died there, poor old buffer.

130
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:25,921
Fireworks at the funeral -
odd custom. Odd people.

131
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:28,518
- (BANGING)
- What's up?

132
00:23:28,684 --> 00:23:31,198
Fireworks frighten off evil spirits.

133
00:23:31,364 --> 00:23:34,083
I know that. Where are you going?

134
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:39,197
You stay with Litefoot. I'll join you later.

135
00:23:39,364 --> 00:23:42,674
- (LITEFOOT) Where are you going?
- Palace Theatre.

136
00:23:42,844 --> 00:23:45,278
There'll be nobody there at this hour!

137
00:23:47,044 --> 00:23:50,036
Extraordinary! I say, how can he join us later?

138
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:53,753
- I haven't given him a card!
- 4 Ranskill Gardens.

139
00:23:53,924 --> 00:23:55,915
He heard you tell the driver.

140
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:59,042
- He's as sharp as a trout!
- Trout?

141
00:24:01,604 --> 00:24:03,879
- (KNOCKING)
- All right! Coming!

142
00:24:04,924 --> 00:24:07,358
Terrible weather for the time of year!

143
00:24:07,524 --> 00:24:09,515
- The theatre's closed!
- Sh!

144
00:24:10,604 --> 00:24:13,118
- What do you want?
- Are you the manager?

145
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:16,959
I'm the owner - Henry Gordon Jago,
at the end of a long day,

146
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:19,922
so if you'd kindly state your business...

147
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,279
How do you do, sir? I'm the Doctor.

148
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:23,843
- Doctor?
- Exactly!

149
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:28,757
I've rumbled your game!
I admire your brass, but it won't do!

150
00:24:28,924 --> 00:24:32,519
- Call back on Saturday.
- Don't move. Hold that.

151
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:40,363
Auditions commence at ten o'clock sharp!

152
00:24:40,524 --> 00:24:43,641
Supporting acts booked for one week only.

153
00:24:51,644 --> 00:24:53,123
Hmm?

154
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:57,444
- Is that all?
- No. Dramatic recitations.

155
00:24:57,604 --> 00:25:01,153
I play the Trumpet Voluntary
in a bowl of live goldfish.

156
00:25:01,324 --> 00:25:03,440
Don't bother coming back.

157
00:25:03,604 --> 00:25:07,995
I'm also a master hypnotist! Now then...

158
00:25:08,164 --> 00:25:11,554
..how long since you were
under the influence, sir?

159
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:14,955
I'm a man of character and determination, sir.

160
00:25:15,124 --> 00:25:18,514
The Rock of Gibraltar would be more easily...

161
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,720
..more easily...

162
00:25:20,884 --> 00:25:24,115
Just as I thought. And quite recently, too.

163
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:26,275
What was your last order?

164
00:25:26,444 --> 00:25:29,834
To remember nothing
since I said goodnight to Casey.

165
00:25:30,004 --> 00:25:32,916
Henry Gordon Jago,

166
00:25:33,084 --> 00:25:37,077
I command you to remember everything
you were ordered to forget.

167
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,520
When I count to three,
you will remember everything.

168
00:25:40,684 --> 00:25:44,677
One...two...three...

169
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:48,678
..more easily influenced
than I would. I have a will of iron!

170
00:25:48,844 --> 00:25:51,199
What the dickens am I talking about?

171
00:25:51,364 --> 00:25:54,674
Did a cab driver come here tonight?

172
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:58,917
There was a fellow burst in
and accosted Mr Chang between shows.

173
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:01,996
- What did he want?
- Something about his Emma.

174
00:26:02,164 --> 00:26:05,315
- Lady friend, no doubt!
- Emma Buller, his wife.

175
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:08,760
She disappeared last night.
Does Mr Chang do a vanishing lady act?

176
00:26:08,924 --> 00:26:13,281
You're not suggesting Chang has
anything to do with these missing...

177
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:15,435
(DOCTOR) What is it?

178
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:19,117
Emma Buller...

179
00:26:22,004 --> 00:26:25,360
E.B... Where did you find this?

180
00:26:25,524 --> 00:26:28,322
In the cellar. Are you from the police?

181
00:26:28,484 --> 00:26:32,602
I'm helping them.
I'd like to see this cellar, Mr Jago.

182
00:26:33,364 --> 00:26:36,276
You're certain these are different streets?

183
00:26:36,444 --> 00:26:39,004
The driver has his orders.

184
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,962
Every night we quarter a new sector.

185
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:45,196
- How much longer?!
- Patience, lord.

186
00:26:45,364 --> 00:26:48,242
We know the time cabinet is here.

187
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,896
Ah, let's see what we have here.

188
00:26:53,064 --> 00:26:57,342
Mrs Hudson always leaves me
a cold collation. Ham, roast beef,

189
00:26:57,504 --> 00:27:01,497
chicken, tongue. Those look
like quail unless I'm much mistaken!

190
00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:03,143
Meat!

191
00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:06,023
Perhaps we shouldn't wait for the Doctor.

192
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:08,618
Help yourself. Plate's on the table.

193
00:27:08,784 --> 00:27:13,778
I'll, um... I'll just put a log or two on the fire.

194
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,613
It's good!

195
00:27:22,784 --> 00:27:26,459
- I'm so glad.
- Is something wrong?

196
00:27:26,624 --> 00:27:30,663
No, would you care for a knife or a fork?

197
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:40,460
It's a good knife. Aren't you going to eat?

198
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:42,933
Yes, yes.

199
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,662
Just going to eat.

(HUMMING WHINE)

201
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,536
Stop! Stop!

202
00:27:59,704 --> 00:28:03,663
Somewhere here! Somewhere!

203
00:28:03,824 --> 00:28:06,463

205
00:28:25,224 --> 00:28:29,456
This is the place, Chang!
The time cabinet is in there!

206
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:34,254
Leave the rest to your servants, lord.
Go back to your abode.

207
00:28:34,424 --> 00:28:37,222
I must have the time cabinet! (COUGHS)

208
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:42,412
Lord, your weakness grows. Go back.
Rest. I will bring the cabinet to you.

209
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:45,621
Very well, but do not fail me now, Chang!

210
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:56,854
Well, if there is a secret entrance,
it's expertly hidden.

212
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:06,255

213
00:29:06,424 --> 00:29:08,415
(JAGO ) Oh!

214
00:29:09,064 --> 00:29:11,578

218
00:29:36,064 --> 00:29:38,532
Oh, thank you, Professor.

219
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:44,539
The Doctor's taking a long time.
I hope he did note the address.

220
00:29:44,704 --> 00:29:47,855
- Great Scott!
- What is it?

221
00:29:48,024 --> 00:29:51,096
There's somebody out there watching the house.

222
00:29:51,264 --> 00:29:54,859
Someone stepped back
into the shrubbery as I looked out.

223
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:59,973
Some scoundrel up to no good!
Odd thing, I could swear he was a Chinese!

224
00:30:00,144 --> 00:30:04,535
Whoever he is, I'll give him more
than he expected! No, you wait here!

225
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:10,543
- How are you feeling?
- The ghost, I saw it!

226
00:30:10,704 --> 00:30:13,502
- Casey, forgive me!
- No, it was a hologram.

227
00:30:13,664 --> 00:30:17,339
I thought there was something
unnatural about that cellar!

228
00:30:17,504 --> 00:30:21,099
There's nothing unnatural
about a holograph technique -

229
00:30:21,264 --> 00:30:23,573
a projection of light by laser beam.

230
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,053
It wasn't known in this century.

231
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:29,694
- Drink this. You'll feel better.
- What was that?

232
00:30:31,544 --> 00:30:33,535
Sh!

233
00:31:30,364 --> 00:31:33,834
- Oh, Doctor!
- Cheer up, Jago. Cheer up!

00:31:42,964 --> 00:31:45,797
He's gone back to his rats. Are you all right?

236
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:48,558
Yes, I think so. Who the devil was it?

237
00:31:48,724 --> 00:31:51,477
I've no idea. He didn't introduce himself.

238
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:54,954
- Shall I call in the police?
- Oh, Henry Gordon Jago!

239
00:31:55,124 --> 00:31:59,481
Then our reclusive phantom
would simply vanish! Boof!

- We can tackle it together. You and I.

242
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:09,561
Think. I'm going to have some supper!

Where's Litefoot?

6
00:34:03,768 --> 00:34:07,647
He went out. He said he'd seen
a Chinaman outside the window.

7
00:34:07,808 --> 00:34:09,639
And you jumped through it!

8
00:34:09,808 --> 00:34:12,197
- Something like that.
- Stay here!

9
00:34:46,408 --> 00:34:48,000

10
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:50,682
Leela, no! Don't!

11
00:34:50,848 --> 00:34:52,725
Leela...

12
00:34:53,888 --> 00:34:57,005
- Ice!
- The sheer criminal effrontery!

13
00:34:57,168 --> 00:34:59,557
Things are coming to a pretty pass

14
00:34:59,728 --> 00:35:02,845
when ruffians will attack
a man in his own home!

15
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:05,397
Well, they WERE Chinese ruffians.

16
00:35:05,568 --> 00:35:08,207
- I wonder what they intended?
- Robbery?

17
00:35:08,368 --> 00:35:13,317
Well, there are some valuable things here.
That K'ang-hsi vase, for instance.

18
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:17,879
My family brought that back
from Peking. Or that Chinese puzzle box.

19
00:35:20,048 --> 00:35:24,121
It doesn't open. A chap spent a week
looking for a secret spring.

20
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,439
- Fused molecules.
- No, lacquered bronze!

21
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:30,281
Extraordinary! It's from this planet!

22
00:35:30,448 --> 00:35:34,441
- A parting gift from the emperor.
- Technology this advanced?

23
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:37,600
Ah! Got it!

24
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:41,204
- That's the answer!
- What are you raving about, Doctor?

00:35:41,368 --> 00:35:43,757
- Weng-Chiang!
- Weng-Chiang?

- There has been no failure, lord.
- Then where is the time cabinet?

- before another dawn.
- I had better!

37

I grow weary of this hole in the ground!

- You are safe here, lord.
- Safe?! It is a trap,

39
00:37:15,008 --> 00:37:17,238
and I was seen returning to it!

40
00:37:17,408 --> 00:37:20,400
- Tonight?
- Yes! And now he knows where I am,

41
00:37:20,568 --> 00:37:22,559
- he will be back!
- Who?

42
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:25,800
By your description, the one you failed to kill!

The Doctor! 

44
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:34,043
- Haven't you slept?
- Sleep is for tortoises.

45
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,483
- Any news of Miss Leela?
- Not yet.

46
00:37:36,648 --> 00:37:41,324
- Should we inform the police?
- No. They already have nine missing girls.

47
00:37:41,488 --> 00:37:45,197
Yes, but missing
under very different circumstances!

48
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:47,836
No. I think I know what they were used for,

49
00:37:48,008 --> 00:37:50,363
and I can't imagine a more grisly fate.

50
00:37:50,528 --> 00:37:52,439
- He's a blackguard!
- Who is?

stalks this city at night - he's a blackguard!

and I haven't got an hour to lose. Look.

00:38:23,588 --> 00:38:28,378
- I will bring a girl, lord.
- One will not be enough this time.

and I need them at once!

- Used for duck mainly.
- Made in Birmingham -

that's the main requirement.
Could you get me a boat?

94
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:35,245
I imagine so. What is the purpose of all this?

95
00:42:35,408 --> 00:42:39,003
To find the confluence
of the Thames and the Fleet, Professor.

96
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:42,285
- And then?
- And then we shall see.

Explode? Unthinkable.
It was made in Birmingham!

108

I took what I could find, lord.

00:44:05,128 --> 00:44:10,043
I have given you knowledge!
I have made you a leader among your fellows!

is a few contemptible slatterns

- who will never be missed!
- But they ARE missed, lord!

117
00:44:17,528 --> 00:44:19,678
And because your need is so great,

118
00:44:19,848 --> 00:44:22,362
- I've had to move unwisely.
- Unwisely?

119
00:44:22,528 --> 00:44:25,600
I took this one
from the rooms above. Nobody saw,

120
00:44:25,768 --> 00:44:29,556
- but it will bring the police here.
- It is of no consequence.

121
00:44:29,728 --> 00:44:32,879
Once I have the time cabinet,
I can move from here.

122
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:36,643
- Put her in the distillation chamber.
- Yes, lord.

123
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:41,396
Leave me to my work!

124
00:44:45,128 --> 00:44:47,961
I shall not keep you waiting long!

(DOCTOR) All right, Professor!

126
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:01,440
- I'll wait for you for two hours.
- Yes, no more.

127

- If I'm still in here at high tide, don't bother!
- Good luck!

147
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:18,143
I've made the acquaintance
of a very high-up gentleman,

148
00:48:18,308 --> 00:48:21,983

who's been called in by the Yard -

150
00:48:24,308 --> 00:48:26,776
- and I am assisting him.
- No!

151
00:48:26,948 --> 00:48:31,021
I am. He told me to watch, Casey,

152
00:48:31,188 --> 00:48:34,976
and I am watching - everywhere!

153
00:48:46,348 --> 00:48:48,942
You incompetent fool!

154
00:48:49,108 --> 00:48:51,622

for the woman I had found.

lay down my life in your service!

- Who?

Presumably, he calls himself Weng-Chiang.

- He was an ancient Chinese god.
- I know, and he probably arrived in this.

52
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:22,203
It was a gift to Mama
from his highness, T'ung-Chi.

It's been in the family quite some years now.

- Weng-Chiang?

to pack any place.

Chang shoot 15 peasants learning this trick!

108
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:30,157
Now, sir, please to look for ace of diamonds!

109
00:59:38,247 --> 00:59:42,206
Oh, very good! Wasn't that good?
Anything else?

110
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:46,360
Honourable gentleman
please to bring cards to stage.

111
00:59:46,527 --> 00:59:52,443

I will now ask my eager volunteer

115
01:01:11,447 --> 01:01:14,723
to step into the Cabinet of Death!

In my country, this is known
as the death of a thousand cuts!

125
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:27,446
I will now ask my new volunteer
kindly to assist in opening the cabinet!

What's happened?

129
01:03:39,807 --> 01:03:42,719
He's dead. He died of a fright.

130
01:03:42,887 --> 01:03:47,165
Poor Casey! He's worked here for years!

131
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:50,876
Doctor, what happened? Did Chang kill him?

132
01:03:51,047 --> 01:03:55,723
No, Chang was as surprised
as anyone. Where's he gone?

133
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:05,516
Are you here, Master?
This is your servant, Li H'sen.

134
01:04:20,767 --> 01:04:23,440
Answer me, lord!

135
01:04:25,607 --> 01:04:28,075
If you're here, answer!

136
01:04:32,007 --> 01:04:34,396
He has gone.

137
01:04:35,687 --> 01:04:40,522
Weng-Chiang, lord of greatness,
has deserted me!

138
01:04:41,687 --> 01:04:45,202
- Lord?
- You've been left to carry the can, Chang!

139

No poison tonight,
there are questions to answer!

140
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:56,798
I will say nothing. It is time
for me to join my forefathers.

141
01:04:56,967 --> 01:05:01,802
Well, the police shouldn't hold you up long.
Where did Weng-Chiang go?

142
01:05:01,967 --> 01:05:06,677
Perhaps back to his great palace in the sky.

143
01:05:06,847 --> 01:05:10,726
I failed him. He was displeased with me.

144
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:12,878
His mind is broken.

145
01:05:13,047 --> 01:05:16,278
Li H'sen, you know he's not a god, don't you?

146
01:05:16,447 --> 01:05:19,280
He came like a god.

147
01:05:19,447 --> 01:05:23,406
He appeared in a blazing cabinet of fire.

148
01:05:23,567 --> 01:05:29,563
I saw him and helped him.
He was tired from his journey.

149
01:05:29,727 --> 01:05:34,278
- Go on.
- He was ill for many months.

150
01:05:34,447 --> 01:05:36,836
I was but a humble peasant,

151
01:05:37,007 --> 01:05:41,717
but I gave him sanctuary
while the soldiers searched. I nursed him.

152
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:45,118
The cabinet! What happened to the cabinet?

153
01:05:45,287 --> 01:05:48,324
The soldiers of T'ung-Chi took it.

154
01:05:49,887 --> 01:05:54,597
Ever since, we have searched
for the great cabinet of Weng-Chiang.

- No, Leela.
- But he's escaping!

01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:17,205
There's no escape that way.

- The time cabinet.

- Damn scoundrels!
- Get him a drink.

10
01:08:20,548 --> 01:08:23,016

11
01:08:23,188 --> 01:08:27,545
- Professor, how did they get in?
- I've no idea.

as soon as you left! Thank you.

- Were they all Chinese?
- Tongwallahs - criminals!

15
01:08:47,948 --> 01:08:51,418
- And one midget.
- Yes! How on earth did you deduce

16
01:08:51,588 --> 01:08:55,376
- that one was a midget?
- Elementary, my dear Litefoot.

17
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:58,585

and let the others in.

Mr Jago, just tell me what all this is about!

01:11:33,008 --> 01:11:35,078
- The Doctor.
- What?

49
01:11:35,248 --> 01:11:37,045
This bag!

50
01:11:37,648 --> 01:11:40,116
Shall we go inside?

51
01:11:42,528 --> 01:11:46,680
Found this in my cellar.
Thought the Doctor might be interested.

52
01:11:46,848 --> 01:11:49,885
- It may concern those Chineses.
- The Chinese?

53
01:11:50,048 --> 01:11:55,122
I considered going to Scotland Yard,
where he's held in the highest esteem.

54
01:11:55,288 --> 01:11:58,644
- The Doctor is?
- Of course. He solves half their cases

55
01:11:58,808 --> 01:12:01,641
while they take the credit, don't you agree?

56
01:12:01,808 --> 01:12:04,766
- I have no idea.
- It stands to reason.

57
01:12:04,928 --> 01:12:07,123
I mean, they're policemen!

We all know they're solid, sterling fellows,

59
01:12:10,448 --> 01:12:13,918
but their buttons
are the brightest thing about them!

60
01:12:14,088 --> 01:12:16,397
Now, the Doctor's a real detective.

61
01:12:16,568 --> 01:12:21,483
Yes, he's certainly very active.
How did you learn of my connection with him?

62
01:12:21,648 --> 01:12:26,802
I enquired at the local station
and they told me that you'd been seen together.

63
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:31,041
The most formidable combination
in the annals of criminology!

64
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:35,406
It's a great honour to be working
with you on this devilish affair!

65
01:12:35,568 --> 01:12:41,040
Thank you! I'm sure the Doctor will be
very interested in these things.

66
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:43,881
Unfortunately, he isn't here at present.

67
01:12:44,048 --> 01:12:46,084
The sleuth that never rests, eh?

68
01:12:46,248 --> 01:12:49,160
Well, he did remark that sleep is for tortoises.

69
01:12:49,328 --> 01:12:54,527
I can't for the life of me discern
what purposes these articles might serve.

70
01:12:54,688 --> 01:12:58,237
It's a queer lot of paraphernalia.
I thought so meself.

71
01:12:58,408 --> 01:13:02,083
And they were left by Weng-Chiang,
this murderous lunatic?

72
01:13:02,248 --> 01:13:06,844
They're nothing to do with the theatre.
The bag was amongst our old junk.

73
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:12,401
In that case, Mr Jago, is it not possible
that someone plans to return for it?

74
01:13:12,568 --> 01:13:15,878
Yes, yes - good point.
We must tell the Doctor.

75
01:13:16,048 --> 01:13:19,802
Or take a hand ourselves.
Well, the Doctor isn't here.

76
01:13:19,968 --> 01:13:23,040
If you and I keep a discreet watch
on the theatre,

77
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:25,722
we might get a chance to nab this fellow!

78
01:13:25,888 --> 01:13:28,960
You're suggesting a pernoctation, Professor.

79
01:13:29,128 --> 01:13:33,280
Unfortunately, the nocturnal vapours
are very bad for my chest.

80
01:13:33,448 --> 01:13:36,679
You can wrap up!
I'll lend you some extra clothing!

81
01:13:36,848 --> 01:13:40,523
- Very kind, I'm sure.
- Now, you write a note to the Doctor,

82
01:13:40,688 --> 01:13:43,202
and I'll look you out a cape!

83
01:13:43,368 --> 01:13:45,836
We might be lucky, Mr Jago,

84
01:13:46,008 --> 01:13:49,205
and if we are, I've a few lumps to repay!

85
01:13:52,248 --> 01:13:55,126
This is their hideaway, no doubt about it.

86
01:13:55,288 --> 01:13:59,759
It's unfortunate there were too many
for us to tackle, eh, Professor?

87
01:13:59,928 --> 01:14:04,001
- I was itching for a scrap!
- The question is, what now?

88
01:14:04,168 --> 01:14:08,161
We could adjourn for liquid refreshment.
I know a spot nearby.

89
01:14:08,328 --> 01:14:11,923
One of us should stay
while the other fetches the Doctor.

90
01:14:12,088 --> 01:14:16,479
- Good idea. I'll be as quick as I can!
- Too late, old man.

94
01:14:40,248 --> 01:14:46,323
(WENG-CHIANG) So...you choose
to pry on the House of the Dragon?

95
01:14:46,488 --> 01:14:52,120
Unwise! Very unwise! You will suffer for it!

96
01:14:52,288 --> 01:14:55,678
You'll be the sufferer when the police get here!

(LAUGHING) The police (?)

98
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:59,223
Mr Sin, they take me for a simpleton!

99
01:14:59,388 --> 01:15:01,822
They'll be here, don't you worry!

100
01:15:01,988 --> 01:15:04,297
You told them where you were coming?

101
01:15:04,468 --> 01:15:07,540
Of course. We're not
completely without sense!

102
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:12,543
Lies! You didn't know where this was!
You followed my men from the theatre!

103
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:16,701
- If that's what you believe...
- Why were you at the theatre?

104
01:15:16,868 --> 01:15:18,381
Answer me!

105
01:15:18,548 --> 01:15:21,585
- Why were we at the theatre?
- I refuse to answer!

106
01:15:21,748 --> 01:15:25,297
- You can do with us as you wish!
- I say, steady on!

107
01:15:25,468 --> 01:15:27,538
Very well, I will tell you why.

108
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:32,862
- You were waiting to see...
- You don't know your own strength!

109
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:36,623
- ..who came to collect the bag!
- You're choking me!

110
01:15:36,788 --> 01:15:39,461
Where is the bag?
What have you done with it?

111
01:15:39,628 --> 01:15:42,620
- Let him go!
- The bag! Tell me!

112
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:46,064
It's at my house.
Now, for pity's sake, release him!

113
01:15:46,228 --> 01:15:51,780
You will die later - slowly!
It will give pleasure to my wolves.

114
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:54,382
You filthy bounder!

115
01:15:54,548 --> 01:15:57,858
In the meantime,
put them with the other prisoners.

116
01:16:04,988 --> 01:16:07,218
(DOCTOR) Litefoot! Litefoot!

117
01:16:11,148 --> 01:16:15,778
''My dear Doctor, contained in this bag,
which I discovered in the cellar,

118
01:16:15,948 --> 01:16:19,418
''is a collection of sundry items
of baffling meaning.

119
01:16:19,588 --> 01:16:23,376
''The Professor and I are keeping
observation on the theatre.

120
01:16:23,548 --> 01:16:25,539
''Your fellow detective H.G.J.''

121
01:16:29,408 --> 01:16:31,399
(JAGO ) Are they dead?

122
01:16:31,748 --> 01:16:33,943
Drugged, I think.

123
01:16:34,108 --> 01:16:36,576
You know why they're here.

124
01:16:36,748 --> 01:16:38,026
Poor creatures! 

125
01:16:41,588 --> 01:16:45,263
Ah! Eureka! Do you know what that is?

126
01:16:45,428 --> 01:16:48,625
You ask me so that you can tell me!

127
01:16:48,788 --> 01:16:52,859
That's right. It's a trionic lattice,
an integral part of a time cabinet.

128
01:16:52,928 --> 01:16:54,919
It can't be opened without it.

129
01:16:55,088 --> 01:16:58,078
- It's a key?
- Yes. He's not only a scientific fool,

130
01:16:58,148 --> 01:17:02,061
- he's an absent-minded one!
- Perhaps he has another ''Eureka''.

131
01:17:02,228 --> 01:17:05,140
No, ''Eureka'' is Greek for ''this bath is too hot''.

132
01:17:05,308 --> 01:17:07,220
There can never be another of this combination.

133
01:17:07,268 --> 01:17:10,385
Dammit, Jago, I don't see any way out of this.

134
01:17:10,548 --> 01:17:14,143
- I think we're done for!
- You're forgetting the Doctor!

135
01:17:14,308 --> 01:17:18,779
- How can he find this place?
- A fleck of mud, a speck of paint,

136
01:17:18,948 --> 01:17:22,258
clues that speak volumes
to an investigator like him!

137
01:17:22,428 --> 01:17:25,386
I'll wager he's on our tracks this very minute!

138
01:17:25,548 --> 01:17:27,345
- Look at this!
- What of it?

139
01:17:27,508 --> 01:17:32,787
- Don't you see? It's a dumb waiter!
- Frankly, I'm not very peckish.

140
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:34,745
How can you think of food?

141
01:17:34,908 --> 01:17:36,660
I'm not thinking of food!

142
01:17:36,828 --> 01:17:41,026
I'm thinking that if we take that shelf out
and squeeze ourselves in,

143
01:17:41,188 --> 01:17:44,703
we can make a surreptitious exit
via the dining room!

144
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:47,905
By jiminy, you're right!

145
01:17:48,068 --> 01:17:50,901
We'll teach those blighters a lesson yet!

146
01:17:51,068 --> 01:17:55,619
They picked the wrong man
when they decided to cross swords with me!

147
01:17:58,148 --> 01:18:00,662
After you, Mr Jago.

148
01:18:00,828 --> 01:18:04,138
Those ropes don't look too sound, do they?

149
01:18:04,308 --> 01:18:06,538
''He that is down need fear no fall!''

150
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:08,699
- Hmm?
- A quotation - Bunyan.

151
01:18:08,868 --> 01:18:10,859
(JAGO ) Very comforting!

152
01:18:16,348 --> 01:18:19,545
- Mind your elbow, Professor!
- Sorry!

153
01:18:22,388 --> 01:18:24,948
(BOTH SHOUT) Heave!

154
01:18:50,548 --> 01:18:54,905
- This isn't the dining room!
- This isn't the way out either.

155
01:19:03,348 --> 01:19:08,786
We must trap them in the crossfire, Doctor,
in the open where they cannot find cover.

156
01:19:08,948 --> 01:19:12,577
What sort of crossfire?
Hazelnuts? Bread pellets?

157
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,216
A house this size must have protection.

158
01:19:15,388 --> 01:19:20,018
The professor will have weapons
in fixed positions to guard the approaches.

159
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:24,500
I brought you to the wrong time,
my girl. You'd have loved Agincourt!

1
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:08,696
There's a Boot Court near the river,
less than a mile from here, look.

2
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:13,894
Oh, you let yourself in,
that's good. We were expecting you.

3
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:17,655
No, Doctor,
it was WE who were expecting YOU!

4
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:21,779
Life's full of little surprises.
What have you done to her?

5
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:26,536
- Nothing...yet!
- Take my advice - don't!

6
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,213
Your advice (?)

7
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:32,532
(HE LAUGHS)
Oh, Doctor, you are an unusual man,

8
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:36,249
but in opposing me, you have gone
far out of your depth!

9
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:39,890
You have taken something from me.
I want it back!

10
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:42,733
Now, I wonder what that could be?

11
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:47,212
I'm always borrowing things
and then forgetting where I put them!

12
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,911
Hmm...

13
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:55,048
It's a terrible habit!

14
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,272
I have never appreciated frivolity!

15
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:02,115
It was in that bag,
it is not there now. Give it to me!

16
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:05,670
- Want one of these?
- The time key, Doctor!

17
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,990
Oh, the time key!

18
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,913
Heavens to Betsy, where did I last see that?

19
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:15,073
I'll give you three seconds
and then Mr Sin will kill the girl!

20
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:17,754
One, two, three! KILL HER!

21
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:22,789
- Stop!
- Is this what you want?

22
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,394
- The trionic lattice?
- Give it to me!

23
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,792
- Careful! I might have dropped it!
- I'll kill you!

24
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:35,556
Crystalline. It'd probably break
into a thousand pieces!

25
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:39,659
- You arrogant jackanapes!
- When I'm crowded I get nervous.

26
01:21:39,820 --> 01:21:43,210
- Back! Back!
- That's better.

27
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:47,891
Give me that key and I will spare her life!

28
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:51,177
Never trust a man with dirty fingernails!

29
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:54,730
You can trust me to kill her
if you do not put it down!

30
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:58,973
- Obey me at once!
- I'll make a bargain with you.

31
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:04,692
You can have the trionic lattice...
when we get to the House of the Dragon.

32
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:07,055
What trickery is this?

33
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:09,609
You're holding two other friends.

34
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:12,931
- What of them?
- I want them released.

35
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,011
Two blundering dolts! Why?

36
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,375
I doubt if you could understand that,

37
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:21,533
- but that's the condition.
- Very well. They're nothing to me!

38
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:23,099
Good.

39
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:28,015
Right then, you and your chaps
can lead the way and I'll follow.

40
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:32,492
- Bring the girl!
- No! The girl stays.

41
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:35,379
You would be wise not to press me too far!

42
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:37,895
Just lead on!

43
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:41,089
Come!

44
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:28,018
- What's the matter?
- I heard something.

45
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:31,172
- What sort of thing?
- People.

46
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,900
Quite a group just went by.

47
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:37,891
More Wongs for the Tong, I suppose!

48
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:42,450
Do you realise we've been here over an hour?

49
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:47,250
- It'll be the dawn soon.
- What does that signify?

50
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:51,572
I'm not aware it signifies anything.
It's just a remark.

51
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:55,130
I thought perhaps
they might do things at dawn.

52
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:57,291
Do things? What sort of things?

53
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:59,690
You know - sacrifice their victims.

54
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,852
You're thinking of the Druids, aren't you?

55
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:06,092
I'm not aware the Chinese
make a ceremony of it.

56
01:24:06,260 --> 01:24:08,979
Good. I don't think I could stomach that.

57
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:13,213
- It's been worrying me somewhat.
- Best not to think about it.

58
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:17,178
I can't help it. Beastly heathens!

59
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:20,730
- That's my trouble, Litefoot.
- What?

60
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,970
Well, I'm not awfully...

61
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:27,258
I'm not so bally brave when it comes to it.
I try, but I'm not.

62
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:30,617
When it comes to it, I don't suppose anybody is!

63
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:35,296
Well, I thought I ought to tell you
anyway, in case I let the side down.

64
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:39,453
You won't, Henry, I know you won't.

65
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:45,416
(WENG-CHIANG) Fetch the prisoners here!

66
01:24:58,460 --> 01:24:59,939
Very impressive!

67
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,773
- I'll have the bird's nest soup!
- What?

68
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:05,659
Well, isn't this where you do the cooking?

69
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:14,370
How can you understand the functions
of a catalytic extraction chamber?

70
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:16,895
Technology far beyond your time!

71
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:21,019
Simple cannibalism! That machine
gets rid of the grisly bits.

72
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:25,059
Much more than that! The secret of life!

73
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:30,692
Your so-called technology
is the twisted lunacy of a scientific dark age!

74
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:35,456
- What do you know of my time?
- Everything!

75
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,497
- Where is it?
- What?

76
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:40,891
Your pig-faced,
pig-brained Peking Homunculus.

77
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:44,859
(WENG-CHIANG) You know of that? How?!

78
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:52,813
I was with the Filipino army
at the final advance on Reykjavik.

79
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:58,259
How can you in the 19th century
know anything of the 51st? You lie!

80
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:01,059
Listen... What's your name?

81
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:04,895
What were you called
before you became a Chinese god?

82
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:07,938
I am Magnus Greel!

83
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:14,977
Oh, yes... The infamous Minister of Justice!

84
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:20,173
The Butcher of Brisbane. Checkmate.

85
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:23,412
It's impossible for you to know these things!

86
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:28,813
I know you're a wanted criminal
and that 100,000 deaths can be laid at your door.

87
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:33,053
Enemies of the state! They were used
in the advancements of science!

88
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:36,496
They were slaughtered in your filthy machine!

89
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:39,970
So...you ARE from the future,

90
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:45,009
and I, for all my achievements,
am only remembered as a war criminal!

91
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:49,378
Of course, it is the winning side
that writes history, Doctor (!)

92
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:53,089
Remember, you would not be here
if it were not for my work!

93
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:55,251
Your work (?)

94
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:59,338
- (PIG-LIKE GRUNTS)
- Your work (?)

95
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:03,891
Yes! I made this possible!
I found the resources, the scientists...

96
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:07,894
The zigma experiments were a failure.
Nothing came of them!

97
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:12,770
No! They were a success!
I used them to escape from my enemies!

98
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:17,889
- The first man to travel through time!
- Hmm, look what it did to you!

99
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:23,339
A temporal distortion
of my metabolism. It can be readjusted!

100
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,617
- Doctor!
- Good morning, gentlemen!

101
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:29,010
What did I tell you? The game's up!

102
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:33,378
- We have the place surrounded!
- We don't have the place surrounded.

103
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:36,691
- We just have an understanding.
- Understanding?

104
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:39,294
I have kept my word. Give me the key!

105
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:41,769
Only when they've gone. Hurry!

106
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:44,135
There are two wretched girls here.

107
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:47,975

- Beware the eye of the dragon!
- Doctor, are you hurt?

heaps of rubbish out of here!/

Perfect! Perfect! After all these years,
the function is unimpaired!

113

The zigma experiment WAS a success!/

117
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,677
- Doctor, are you all right?
- Greel's got the key!

118
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:57,116
- How long have I been unconscious?
- Only a few minutes.

- There must be something we can do!

There's always something we can do.
Get them against the wall./

123
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:25,519
Almost ready!
Yes, time to prepare my two partridges!

124
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,910
Why don't you come down from there?

125
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:33,278
Sulking because I wouldn't let you
kill the Doctor, is that it?

126
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:40,152
Before you kill him, I must drain every scintilla
of his knowledge about the zigma experiment!

(PIG-LIKE GRUNTS)

128

You can kill him then, and as many
more as you wish, before we leave!

129
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:49,950
All I need is to re-establish
my proteinoid balance,

130
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,510
then I can enter the zigma beam
for the second time.

131
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:58,754
Only this time, there must be
no mistake in the programme DNA levels!

132
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,036
Now for my two partridges!

133
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,589
Die, Bent Face!

134
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:09,432
No! Spare me, please!

135

136

The second time! The second attempt
on my life by this she-devil!

137
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,838
Hold her still!

138
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:30,555
No... No, I have a better fate for you!

139
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:36,155
She will be the first morsel
to feed my regeneration!

140

Kill me any way you wish!
Unlike you, I am not afraid to die!

We shall see! Bring the tigress here!

142
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:49,115
At my camps, the extraction process
was considered the most painful of all.

143

They pleaded for anything but this!

144
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:54,314
I shall not plead, but I promise you this -

145
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:58,871
when we are in the great hereafter,
I shall hunt you down, Bent Face,

146
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:02,157

Well, Greel won't keep us waiting long.

154

- He needs his proteinoids.
- His what?

155
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:30,394
He's dying. His body's fading away fast.

156
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,633
He's trying to cheat death
by substituting certain materials.

157
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,588
- Do you understand?
- I think so, the principle anyway.

158
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:42,150
All he achieves is a postponement
of the inevitable.
