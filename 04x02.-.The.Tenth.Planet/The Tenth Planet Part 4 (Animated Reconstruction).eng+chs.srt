00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:56,364
I don't hear any bright suggestions coming from you two guys!
我可没从你们两个家伙这里听到什么好主意

132
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:57,492
Go on.
继续

133
00:08:57,752 --> 00:08:59,471
Well, any idea how strong these Cybermen are?
是这样, 你们知道这些赛博人很强壮吧？

134
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:00,545
A rough idea.
知道一点

135
00:09:00,726 --> 00:09:03,170
Yeah, well they could lift a man like he was... well, like he was a wrench, right?
是, 他们可以像拿起一个...扳手一样举起一个人, 对不?

136
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:04,023
Yes, well?
是, 那又怎样？

137
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:06,941
Well they're also pretty advanced geezers, way ahead of us.
而且他们比我们先进, 远超我们

138
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:09,671
What has this got to do with it?
这又有什么关系？

139
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:12,027
Well, that just it. With all this, why should they need us? 
这就是了, 既然这样, 他们为什么需要我们？

140
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,324
Well, they could shift that bomb in half the time! So why get us to do it?
他们自己搞定这个炸弹只要一半的时间！为什么要让我们来做这个？

141
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:23,327
Also, you'll notice they remain outside this door,
looking at us all the time through the door. Well why?
还有, 注意到没有, 他们始终待在门外, 通过门盯着我们干活．为什么？

142
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,199
This is just a waste of time.
这简直就是浪费时间啊．

143
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:29,926
Now wait a minute, I think I see what he's driving at. 
They use us because they daren't handle it themselves.
等等, 我想我明白他想要说什么了, 他们要我们来干是因为他们自己干不了

144
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:31,987
Yeah, but the point is, why? Well you're the scientists.
对, 关键问题是, 为什么？你们是科学家啊

145
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:36,933
Don't you see, Dyson? It could that they're afraid of radioactivity.
你没看出来吗, Dyson? 很可能是他们害怕放射线

146
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:42,100
Let's get this one inside and see what it does to him. 
Now look... all lie down on the floor... play dead.
我们把这家伙搞进来, 试一试就知道．来, 全躺地板上...装死

147
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:43,726
This is ridiculous... games.
这是个荒谬的...游戏

148
00:09:43,945 --> 00:09:46,269
Well may be, but it's worth giving it a try. Come on, lie down.
可能是, 但值得博一吧．来吧, 躺下

149
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:53,041
Help! Help! Come in here, mate, there's something up! Help!
救命！救命！进来一下, 朋友, 这里有事发生！救命

150
00:09:57,825 --> 00:09:58,874
You see?
对吧？

151
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:02,889
What did you do that for? We could have escaped!
你干那个干什么？ 我们可以逃出去的！

152
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:04,835
To where? We're okay right where we are.
逃去哪儿？我们待在这里反而没问题

153
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:07,528
And they can't set off this bomb while we defend this room!
而且他们也没法引爆这个炸弹, 只要我们在这个房间守住了！

154
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:11,460
Right! So all we've go to do is sit tight 
until Mondas breaks up like the Doctor said!
对！我们现在要做的就是好好坐着, 等着 Mondas 像博士说的那样解体掉！

155
00:10:11,506 --> 00:10:15,960
Well, we've got them! But they've still got the Doctor and Polly.
我们搞定他们了！不过博士和 Polly 还在他们手上

156
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:20,791
Well gentlemen, stalemate I think, don't you agree? 
好了, 绅士们, 我觉得陷入僵局了, 你们同意吗？

157
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:23,033
Well now, what about a little talk, hmm?
现在我们谈一谈吧, 嗯？

158
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:29,048
You forget we can do what we like with all of you and the girl.
你忘了所有人,还有那个女孩儿都在我们手上,我们想怎样就怎样

159
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:33,344
Oh, quite so, but I'm afraid that won't help save your planet.
噢, 的确是, 但恐怕我不能帮忙拯救你们的星球了

160
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:43,798
Listen to me. This close proximity of our two planets...
听我说, 我们两个星球靠得太近

161
00:10:43,888 --> 00:10:47,298
...means that one has to be eliminated for the safety of the other.
这意味着要保障其中一个的安全, 就得毁灭另外一个

162
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:56,298
The one to be destroyed will be Earth. 
We cannot allow Mondas to burn up.
将被毁灭的是地球, 我们不可能让 Mondas 烧毁

163
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:03,503
If you help, we will take you all back to Mondas with us. 
There you will be safe.
如果你帮忙, 我们可以把你们全带回 Mondas, 你们将是安全的

164
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:05,125
Yeah? For how long?
是吗？ 安全多久？

165
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:06,586
It could be our only chance.
这可能是我们唯一的机会

166
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:10,740
The answer is no! We'll just sit tight here until Mondas breaks up.
答案是不！我们只坐在这里, 等着 Mondas 解体

167
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:13,340
Now then, you'd better release the Doctor and Polly
and send them down here.
现在, 你们最好还是释放博士和 Polly, 把他们送下来．

168
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,240
You're gonna need our help when Mondas is gone!
Mondas 消失之后你们需要我们的帮助的

169
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:17,863
Mondas will not burn up.
Mondas 不会烧毁的

170
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,333
Take the old man out to the spacecraft.
将这个老人带出去，送进飞船

171
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,330
You will regret this.
你会后悔的

172
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:29,644
Now we give you three minutes to start fusing the warhead.
现在我们给你们三分钟时间, 解除弹头

173
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:34,144
If you fail, you will never see your friends again.
如果你们失败了, 你们就再也见不到你们的朋友了

174
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:36,743
...really done it. What do we do now?
...试过了． 现在我们怎么办？

175
00:11:37,018 --> 00:11:38,714
This is hopeless... we must do as they say!
这样不行啊...我们必须按他们说的做！

176
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,638
- Well, it could be a bluff. - Yeah, how do we find out?
- 但也可能是在咋呼  - 嗯, 我们怎么能知道呢？

177
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:44,979
We must stick to our plan and sit tight. 
There are millions of lives at stake.
我们必须沿着原计划来, 坚持不动．毕竟有数百万人命在旦夕啊．

178
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:47,329
Yeah, but there must be something we can do!
但我们肯定能做点什么！

179
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:53,932
What did you do that for? 
Now we can't communicate with them.
你为什么这么做啊？这下没法跟他们联系了

180
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:57,467
No, and they can't spy on us either. 
Now this is what I think we should do.
没法了, 不过他们也不能监视我们了． 这就是我觉得我们该干的

181
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:08,304
Doctor... Doctor?
博士...博士？

182
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:10,679
Hmm... What is it, child?
唔...怎么了, 孩子？

183
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:14,920
Engines! They're not going to take off, are they?
引擎！他们不打算起飞, 是吧？

184
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:23,594
No, no. Wait! The vibrations. 
Perhaps it's coming from Mondas!
不, 不． 等等！ 这个振动, 也许是来自 Mondas!

185
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:25,606
What do you mean, Mondas?
Mondas? 什么意思？

186
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:32,264
This spacecraft receives its energy from Mondas. 
Perhaps it's absorbing too much.
这艘飞船是从 Mondas 接收能量的, 可能它吸收得太多了

187
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,123
Don't mean it's going to blow up, do you?
是不是意味着它就要爆炸了, 是吗？

188
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:38,125
No, I don't know, child. It is an unknown power...
我也不知道, 孩子．这是一种未知的能量

189
00:12:39,436 --> 00:12:41,651
Doctor, I'm scared!
博士, 我害怕！

190
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:43,084
What's it weigh then?
这东西有多重？

191
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:46,418
You're not thinking of carrying that thing around with you, are you?
你没打算带着那个东西四处走吧？

192
00:12:46,771 --> 00:12:49,283
I'm not asking you. Can it be shifted, Dr Barclay?
我又没让你扛．能挪动它吗, Barclay博士？

193
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:51,867
No, it would be an impossible task to use it as you intend using it.
不, 没法按你的这种方法来使用它

194
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,342
Well, just what is there in this room that is radioactive and that a bloke could carry?
那, 这个房间里有没有什么东西, 既有放射性, 又能扛着走？

195
00:12:55,517 --> 00:13:00,315
Nothing. You're wasting your time and ours. 
And our three minutes is nearly up, anyway.
没有． 你的浪费你的时间, 和我们的时间．三分钟就快到了

196
00:13:00,498 --> 00:13:01,638
You think so.
那是你觉得

197
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:05,076
Is there anything behind here that is radioactive?
有没有什么带放射性的东西？

198
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:08,488
Well yes, of course. That's the base nuclear reactor. 
It supplies all the power.
有, 当然有．这是基地的核反应器, 它供应所有能源

199
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:10,778
Well what's it like? Is there anything that could be moved by hand?
哦, 什么样的？能不能用手搬动？

200
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:14,970
Well, if we extracted the reactor rods
they could be carried for a short distance...
嗯, 如果我们发反应棒抽出来, 应该可以短距离移动

201
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,010
- ..but it would be a very tricky operation.
- Well, it's our only hope. Come on!
-  ...不过这可要非常小心  - 这是我们唯一的希望, 来吧！

202
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:22,532
- Are you both quite mad? 
- Look, Dyson, we're the sane ones. 
- 你们俩都疯了？  - 看, Dyson, 我们才是理智的人

203
00:13:22,644 --> 00:13:25,186
 Do you really think those Cybermen intend to let us live?
你真的认为那些赛博人打算让我们活着？

204
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,325
They gave us their word.
他们做了承诺了

205
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:29,105
They just said anything they thought we'd listen to.
他们只是说了觉得我们可能会听的话

206
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:32,305
They've got no feelings, remember? 
They told us that. So what's to stop them?
他们没有感情的, 记得吗？他们告诉过我们的。那怎么阻止他们呢？

207
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:36,405
Anyway, you might as well face it, mate - your number's up either way.
不管怎么说, 你得面对这个问题了, 朋友 - 不管怎样时间都要到了。

208
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:40,405
So why not try, eh? We need your help anyway, okay?
为什么不试试？我们需要你的帮助, 好吗？

209
00:13:49,548 --> 00:13:51,401
Records, Krang.
数据记录，Krang

210
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,222
Our planet is nearing saturation point.
我们的星球快要达到饱和点了

211
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:01,523
We must lose no time. Switch on the monitor.
不能耽误时间。打开屏幕

212
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,822
Their three minutes is up, we must hear their decision.
他们的三分钟时间到了, 我们听听他们的决定

213
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:11,428
What has happened?
怎么回事？

214
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:15,006
Hold them away from yourselves. Gently does it, very gently.
拿得离你自己远一点, 小心, 非常小心

215
00:14:15,141 --> 00:14:18,306
Stand by the emergency power switch. 
The lights will be fading any second now.
站在紧急电源开关旁边, 灯很快就要熄灭了

216
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:26,738
I suppose you realize there's only about an hour's supply of lighting and heating in the emergency batteries.
我想你明白备用电池只有一小时的电源吧, 照明和供热都靠它

217
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:27,938
Then we shall all freeze to death.
然后我们都会被冻死

218
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:30,453
If this don't work, mate, you needn't worry about the cold anymore.
朋友, 如果这个不起作用, 你就再也不用担心冷不冷了

219
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:36,997
Okay, it's all clear. Quick! 
好, 外面没人. 快! 

220
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Dyson, you go up this end of the corridor. 
When you hear the Cybermen coming, come out behind them.
Dyson, 你到走廊这头去, 如果你听到赛博人来了, 就到他们后面去

221
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:50,490
Haines, you go round that corridor and do the same.
Haines, 你绕过走廊, 也这样

222
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:55,490
Now look, I'll draw their fire, 
so when you hear the sound of this gun, start coming forward.
然后, 我去引开火力．当你们听到枪声, 就出来

223
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:57,690
Do you really think there's enough radiation in these two rods to trap them?
你真觉得这两个反应棒有足够的放射性, 可以搞定他们吗？

224
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,481
- Just  - Okay, come on.
- 够吧  - 好, 来吧

225
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:11,942
Do not use this gas unless you have to. 
We need them alive and conscious.
不到万不得已, 不要用瓦斯．最好抓活的

226
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:17,419
They're coming. Quick! Behind the door.
他们来了, 快！到门后面去

227
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:25,834
Your three minutes is up. What is your decision?
你们的三分钟已经到了, 做出决策了吗？

228
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:31,591
We shall be forced to kill you. 
We will give you one more chance...
看来我们不得不杀死你们, 再给你们一次机会...

229
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,402
- ...to come out and give us the bomb.
- Come in and get it!
- 出来, 把炸弹交给我们  - 进来拿吧！

230
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:58,169
There's something else down by the door!
门下边有什么东西！

231
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:01,929
Now!
动手！

232
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:11,433
I can't hold out much longer!
我坚持不住了！

233
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:12,913
Where's Dyson and the other bloke got to?
Dyson 和其他人都去哪里了？

234
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:19,829
The humans are behind the door. 
Let the gas do its work.
人类都在门后面, 用瓦斯来解决问题

235
00:16:28,062 --> 00:16:30,413
Quick, Dyson! Help get Barclay out of here!
快, Dyson! 帮忙把 Barclay 弄出去！

236
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:46,114
Back to your desks all of you. The emergency's not over yet.
你们所有人, 回到你们自己的桌子去．紧急状况还没解除呢

237
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:50,214
Philips, there are two reactor rods in the corridor. 
See that they're put back at once.
Philips, 走廊里有两个反应棒, 确保它们回归原位

238
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,460
- Hey, they've still got the Doctor and Polly.  - No, wait!
- 嘿, 博士和 Polly 还在他们手上  - 不，等等

239
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:55,761
If you try and tackle the spacecrafts on your own, 
you don't stand a chance.
如果你们试图自己来对付飞船, 一点机会都没有

240
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:57,861
We don't know how many Cybermen there are left.
我们不知道到底还有多少赛博人

241
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,183
- Well?  - Here's one of the things they use to contact each other.
- 那？ - 这个东西是他们用来相互联系的

242
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:02,959
I don't know how it works.
我不知道怎么用

243
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:05,284
Well then do anything, make a signal! Draw them here.
就这样随便做点什么, 制造个信号, 把他们吸引过来

244
00:17:05,552 --> 00:17:06,449
Is that wise?
这样明智吗？

245
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,417
Well, if that spaceship takes off we'll never gonna see them again.
啊, 要是飞船起飞了我们就再也见不到他们了

246
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:10,089
You may bring them all in on us!
你可能把他们都招过来的！

247
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:11,619
Well that's a risk we've got to take.
这风险我们得担

248
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:19,912
That should do it. Any idea how long it'll take for them to get here?
应该可以了．他们到达这里估计要多久？

249
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:21,526
You stand by with those guns.
你守着这些枪，随时待命

250
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:23,369
Now look, we must all get down by the other side of the room.
看, 我们必须在房间的另一边蹲下来

251
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:24,199
Okay.
好

252
00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:27,555
Opposite the door so we can face them. Use the guns.
对着门, 这样我们可以面对他们．用这个枪

253
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:31,525
What now?
然后呢？

254
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:34,054
The emergency battery's running out, I suppose.
紧急备用电池耗光了, 我估计

255
00:17:34,162 --> 00:17:35,505
We can't face them in the dark!
