5
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:50,061
Man, it's blowing like crazy out there. All I can see is snow, snow and more snow.

6
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:31,007
Quite an arctic storm blowing out there. Hmm! Come along Polly, my child, with my cloak.

7
00:01:31,316 --> 00:01:33,023
Hey Doctor, you've got the most fantastic wardrobe!

8
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:34,765
Yes, well I'm glad you approve my child.

9
00:01:35,255 --> 00:01:37,503
These are gorgeous. Where do you shop, Carnaby street?! Ha ha!

10
00:01:37,702 --> 00:01:39,293
Who do you think you are, Nanook of the North or something?!

11
00:01:39,477 --> 00:01:41,406
Oh now, now, now. Tcha, tcha, tcha. Stop being so flippant.

12
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:45,606
We don't know what we are in for outside there. Now come along, come along, come along.

13
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:46,933
Here you are, Doctor.

14
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:49,061
Are you sure you're going to be warm enough?

15
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:52,367
Oh, like toast my dear. Now, did you find everything you want?

16
00:01:52,415 --> 00:01:53,067
Yes thanks!

17
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:55,570
All right, well let's go outside and investigate. Go along.

18
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,241
The Doctor was right about this being the coldest place on earth. I'm freezing already.

19
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,930
Yeah.

20
00:02:08,153 --> 00:02:09,076
Hey, what's this?

21
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,503
Well watch it Polly!

22
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:14,849
It's some kind of an aerial. There must be something buried underneath there.

23
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:17,645
Hey, look over there, there's something moving.

24
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,718
Hey Tito, will you come over here?

25
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,549
Oh, what is it?

26
00:02:30,756 --> 00:02:32,901
Come over here quick! I can see people!

27
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:35,102
Sure, sure, lots of people!

28
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:37,211
- And there's a woman!   - A woman...

29
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:38,974
A WOMAN! Hey!

30
00:02:41,336 --> 00:02:48,213
Hey, hey! Mama Mia bellissima!

31
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:54,329
Looks... looks like some kind of a hut.

32
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,429
Quick, take those small arms, get upstairs and get... bring them down. Get moving!

33
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:08,516
I think we'd better go with 'em.

34
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:19,462
Move it, come on, hurry it up, come on, let's go, let's go, come on pops,

35
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,460
Will you move it, will you move it pops, let's go, come on!

36
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:22,996
Please stop that. Please, please stop that.

37
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:26,297
Just a moment pops. Now who are you, and what are you doing here?

38
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:27,865
Oh, we just landed outside.

39
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:30,647
- What in?  - Well it's a sort of spaceship actually.

40
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,806
- Ha ha! Some spaceship, box!   - You can knock off the jokes.

41
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:33,350
She's not joking.

42
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:35,434
Look buddy, I want the truth, and quick.

43
00:03:35,642 --> 00:03:37,259
Can you tell us precisely where we are please?

44
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,422
You're at the South Pole base of international space command, and frankly pops...

45
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,146
Doctor.

46
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,222
...Doctor, your story's gonna have to be awful good.

47
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,506
So you mean we are on Earth?

48
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,115
Well you heard, the South Pole.

49
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,588
Oh boy. Tito, get the CO.

50
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:51,020
He's a-not going to like it.

51
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:51,918
Get him!

52
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:53,473
Why don't you speak up, I'm deaf!

53
00:03:53,724 --> 00:03:54,847
Who's the CO?

54
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,250
The Commanding Officer, the boss.

55
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,826
Hallo... Sir? Er, Private Tito, duty guard here.

56
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:02,826
Could you give a message to the General please?

57
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:05,066
- General?  - General Cutler, the CO.

58
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:11,535
Sir? I know, but this is an emergency! What's that? The General's not there?

59
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:13,514
Well canna you tell me where he is then?

60
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:14,863
Right here, Private.

61
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,800
What is it Sergeant?

62
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:19,501
Ah, well sir...

63
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,228
Who are these people?

64
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:23,741
Well sir, they just appeared outside.

65
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:24,487
What?

66
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:27,279
Yes sir, as I said they just appeared, from a hut.

67
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:28,350
A hut?!

68
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes sir. Never been there before.

69
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:32,444
That's a right General. That's just the way it happened.

70
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:39,530
Well? Who are you?

71
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,575
Able seaman Ben Jackson sir, Royal Navy.

72
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,907
Then why aren't you with your ship?

73
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,008
That's a bit difficult to explain sir.

74
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,714
Yeah, I'll bet my sweet life it is.

75
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:49,671
We don't intend you any harm General, I can assure you of that.

76
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:54,832
You can assure me of what you like, but whether I'll believe you or not is another question.

77
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:56,089
Huh, huh!

78
00:04:56,912 --> 00:05:01,437
I haven't got time to deal with these now, but when I do you'd better have a good explanation.

79
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:03,690
I don't like your tone, sir.

80
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:06,591
And I don't like your face, nor your hair!

81
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:07,378
Hmm!

82
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:10,454
Sergeant, bring him into Tracking and put him under guard in the observation room.

83
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,524
I'll deal with them as soon as I have time.

84
00:05:14,123 --> 00:05:14,425
Yes sir!

85
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:22,808
OK, come on, move...

86
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:32,195
Hey, this is smashing. It looks just like that rocket place in America.

87
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:33,632
Yeah, but I wonder why there are so few people.

88
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,260
I mean it's not like what you see on the telly, is it?

89
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:36,824
I don't know what you see on your TV, son,

90
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,524
but this is General Cutler's outfit. Come on, you'd better take a seat.

91
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:43,668
He don't like a lot of personnel, cuts down to the bare minimum and works them right into the ground.

92
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:47,664
We only spend a couple of months on this station anyway. We can't stand more than that.

93
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:48,399
Ha ha ha!

94
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,823
I see. Hey, perhaps we can catch a lift back to England.

95
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:53,228
Oh, I can't see the squire there giving us a free lift to anywhere.

96
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:57,968
Well I don't want to depress you both but I'm afraid we're not quite where you think we are.

97
00:05:58,187 --> 00:05:58,891
- What do you mean?  - What?

98
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:01,732
Well, just take a peek at that. Huh huh! Hmm!

99
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:06,316
1986! Oh no, and I thought we'd be able to get home.

100
00:06:06,585 --> 00:06:09,855
Yeah, we're still at sea. Here, but that'll explain the few people.

101
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,295
The computers must do all the work now. Here, I wonder if they got to the moon yet.

102
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:15,564
Sure, don't you listen to the news?

103
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:16,917
You mean you have sent people to the moon?

104
00:06:17,137 --> 00:06:18,658
Yeah, an expedition just returned.

105
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,127
Well what's this flight then?

106
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:22,125
Oh, this is just a normal atmosphere testing probe.

107
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:24,461
Yes, I see, a rocket testing site. Hum hum!

108
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:25,574
Hey, what's that?

109
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:26,866
An error? Where?

110
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:32,914
Looks bad. We're now over south isle of New Zealand and reading a height of 1100 miles.

111
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:36,696
1100? But that's impossible! Dyson, check what it should be, will you?

112
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,776
It should be 980.

113
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,923
No, it can't be, let me try.

114
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:41,218
Let me do it.

115
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:47,971
No, you're right. 980 miles... they're out of position by more than a hundred miles!

116
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:48,923
Mmm, looks like it.

117
00:06:49,203 --> 00:06:50,707
Snowcap to Zeus 4. Can you read me?

118
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:54,050
Zeus 4 to Snowcap. Strength 8, over.

119
00:06:54,354 --> 00:06:57,250
Take visual checks on Mars to establish position. Report back.

120
00:06:57,285 --> 00:07:00,658
Here we are. Well now, excuse me my dear...

121
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:01,949
...er, take this to your General please.

122
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:02,972
Me? Are you crazy?

123
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:05,695
Very well then, take me to the General. I think perhaps I can help him.

124
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,882
Oh I... I don't know.

125
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:08,859
Now look here Sergeant, this is urgent, I insist.

126
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,899
General, sir.

127
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:14,808
Yes, what is it?

128
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:16,675
The old boy would like to have a word with you. Claims it's urgent.

129
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,931
OK, bring him over. But make it fast.

130
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:21,467
I think I know what you are going to see.

131
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,130
How can you possibly? Oh, get him back over there.

132
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:25,999
I've written down here what he will see.

133
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:27,267
Take your hands off me please!

134
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:29,068
Barclay! It's not very clear but it's a planet all right.

135
00:07:29,277 --> 00:07:31,046
How could it be? Planets don't just appear.

136
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:32,503
It must be on a weak orbit.

137
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:35,251
It's approaching quite fast. Barclay, couldn't it be...

138
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:39,946
I know what you're thinking. Zeus 4 is out of orbit and a new planet has appeared.

139
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,046
Therefore the new planet is influencing Zeus 4. Right?

140
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:44,097
That's about it.

141
00:07:44,307 --> 00:07:45,510
We must get them down!

142
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:47,283
An emergency splash zone?

143
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:55,796
Yes. Snowcap calling Zeus 4, come in please. Zeus 4 come in please. Do you read me?

144
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:57,839
Yes, we read you loud and clear.

145
00:07:58,112 --> 00:08:02,240
You are strength 2 only. Come in please, speak up.

146
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:04,660
Fuel cells are showing a power loss.

147
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:05,721
Power loss?

148
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,029
Its gravity is affecting the capsule.

149
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:09,158
What shall we do about it?

150
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,200
Well first of all we must give Zeus 4 a new correction path. Will you do that?

151
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:12,869
Right away.

152
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,381
You try and get a better fix on that so-called planet and see what it is.

153
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:15,992
Right sir.

154
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:16,929
It's better now.

155
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:21,180
You say you know what this planet is. Well what is it?

156
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:24,205
Well I'm not quite sure sir. Let me have another look into this instrument.

157
00:08:25,744 --> 00:08:28,386
Feed the retina scope into the observations room's monitor.

158
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:30,907
Look Dr Barclay, let's just get those boys down.

159
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,676
General, General, yes, it's just as I thought.

160
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:35,576
Come and have a look at these land masses.

161
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:38,978
Land masses? I don't see... I see what you mean.

162
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,735
Now, doesn't that remind you of anything, hmm?

163
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:43,283
Remind? No, I don't think so.

164
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:44,729
Yeah, it looks familiar somehow.

165
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:50,531
Yeah. Hey Ben, look, that bit looks just like... Malaysia!

166
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:57,343
Oh, give over. No, hang on, isn't that... well it looks like South America but it can't be though!

167
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,686
Yes, there is a similarity.

168
00:08:58,779 --> 00:08:59,892
Nonsense, how could there be?

169
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:01,722
This is unbelievable. That's surely Africa?

170
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:04,346
Yes, certainly and that is Malaysia!

171
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:06,767
Ridiculous. There must be some reflection of Earth.

172
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,527
No it can't be, there's nothing to reflect on!

173
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:12,321
And now my dear Dr Barclay I suggest you look at that piece of paper I gave you.

174
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:13,918
Paper? Oh yes...

175
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,114
You knew!

176
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:20,958
Certainly.

177
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,831
Knew what?

178
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:25,889
He has correctly written down what we have just seen and he did it before we saw it.

179
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:28,620
Oh, it's a... simple confidence trick, that's all.

180
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,404
No, I know when he gave me the paper.

181
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:34,009
Now, you clearly know something more about the situation. Can you be more explicit?

182
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:36,690
Yes sir, I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can.

183
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,290
You see, millions of years ago there was a twin planet to Earth and...

184
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:41,783
Oh, for heaven's sake!

185
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,962
Roger, Zeus 4...

186
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,403
Get me Geneva on the radio link.

187
00:09:47,864 --> 00:09:49,294
We'll see what Wigner has to say about this.

188
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:51,806
You're looking terribly worried Doctor.

189
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:55,283
Am I my dear? Yes, I'm afraid I am rather worried.

190
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:56,211
What is it Doctor? What's up?

191
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,846
Well you see Ben, I know what this planet is and what it means to Earth.

192
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,083
And what does it mean to Earth?

193
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:03,831
Well, that pretty soon we shall be having visitors.

194
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:09,968
Now, suppose you tell me how you really came here.

195
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:11,742
Yes, well I'm afraid all that's going to be rather difficult.

196
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:16,966
Now just a minute. You turn up out of nowhere, a routine space shot goes wrong...

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,466
a new planet appears and you tell us you know all about it. That puts you slap bang in the hot seat, right

198
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:23,776
Hot seat?

199
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:25,914
But we've got nothing to do with it.

200
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,047
That you're going to have to prove.

201
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:31,362
Well, I think if you allowed us to return where we came from, huh, huh! I...

202
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,189
You're not going anywhere.

203
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:38,953
- Sergeant?  - Yes sir?

204
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:40,955
- Have you searched that hut yet?  - No, sir

205
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:46,355
Well why not?! Look, I don't want any excuses, get out there and do it immediately.

206
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:53,133
Now, perhaps we'll get to the bottom of this.

207
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,722
Come on Tito, we have to go break into a hut.

208
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,265
What, that thing out there?

209
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,252
Yeah, that's right. Come on, hurry up and get dressed up.

210
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:00,300
Oh, mama.

211
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:23,334
It's no good Tito, we'll need a welding torch to get inside this thing.

212
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,200
Get back inside and bring me out one. You'll need some help, OK?

213
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:30,233
Hurry up will ya, before I freeze to death!

214
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:41,134
What the heck? Huh, Tito! Is that you Tito?

215
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,709
What's going on here? Who is that?

216
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:54,643
Who the heck are you?!

217
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:03,608
OK Joe, that should do it. OK, let's go.

218
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:16,053
Hey, this is where it is guys.

219
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,225
That's the most fantastic story I've ever heard.

220
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,392
I can only repeat, sir, what I have already told you.

221
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,992
You will get visitors from that other planet.

222
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:46,193
Nonsense.

223
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,502
It's imperative that I talk to you, General.

224
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:18,514
Get away, old man. Can't you see...

225
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,589
You, will you pay attention? Will you?!

226
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:25,441
Get this man back into the observations room. Sergeant, that was an order!

227
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:27,080
Take that man back to the obs...

228
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:32,997
Back to your places.

229
00:13:37,557 --> 00:13:38,424
Oh no...

230
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:39,999
Come back Polly, they'll blow your head off!

231
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:40,737
Ah!

232
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:47,408
Now look, I don't know who you are or what you are...

233
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:50,408
...but we've got two men in space, if we don't act now we won't get them back alive.

234
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:51,979
They will not return.

235
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:53,135
Why not?

236
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:56,413
It is unimportant now.

237
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,894
But... We must get them back! When...

238
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:03,740
There is really no point. They could never reach Earth now.

239
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,048
But don't you care?

240
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:08,037
Care? No, why should I care?

241
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:10,246
Because they're people and they're going to die!

242
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:17,696
I do not understand you. There are people dying all over your world yet you do not care about them.

243
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,470
Yes, but we could avoid their deaths...

244
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:23,156
You will be wondering what has happened.

245
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,356
Your astronomers will have just discovered a new planet. Is that not so?

246
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,506
Yes, that's right.

247
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:32,793
That is where we come from. It is called Mondas.

248
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:33,955
Mondas?

249
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:36,315
Mondas? But isn't that one of the ancient names of Earth?

250
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,733
Yes. Aeons ago our planets were twins then we drifted away from you...

251
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:45,733
...on a journey to the edge of space. Now we have returned.

252
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,004
You were right, Doctor.

253
00:14:47,224 --> 00:14:48,628
But who or what are you?

254
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,279
We are called Cybermen.

255
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:52,523
Cybermen?

256
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:57,184
Yes, Cybermen. We were exactly like you once

39
00:14:57,442 --> 0:15:01,0884
but our cybernetic scientists realised that our race was getting weak.

257
00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:03,099
Weak, how?

258
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:09,909
Our life span was getting shorter so our scientists and doctors devised spare parts for our bodies

259
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:15,009
...until we could be almost completely replaced.

260
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:19,239
But... that means you're not like us. You're robots!

261
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:25,665
Our brains are just like yours except that certain weaknesses have been removed.

262
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,525
Weaknesses? What weaknesses?

263
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,331
You call them emotions, do you not?

264
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:34,931
But... that's terrible! You... you mean you wouldn't care about someone in pain?

265
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:38,970
There would be no need. We do not feel pain.

266
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,403
But we do.

267
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:42,807
General!

268
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:46,101
Ha, that'll fix ya! Europe will know there's an emergency here now.

269
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,481
That was really most unfortunate. You should not have done that.

270
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:59,016
Switch off the radio and tell Europe that nothing further has happened and that all is well here.

271
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:00,867
I'll do no such thing.

272
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:02,451
That is an order.

273
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:05,991
Go take a jump!

274
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:07,755
Trigger pack.

275
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:20,579
Stay where you are.

276
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:22,035
You've killed him!

277
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:25,182
I have not killed him. He will recover.

278
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:30,982
Now, someone must answer your commander in Europe. He is waiting.

279
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:32,466
I refuse.

280
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:35,768
You.

281
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:36,874
Yes?

282
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:39,895
Which are the communication controls?

283
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:41,522
O... over here.

284
00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:42,455
Dyson!

285
00:16:46,402 --> 00:16:47,716
Stand aside

286
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,591
What are you going to do?

287
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:54,259
You will see.

288
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:57,395
If you destroy those we shall be unable to keep contact with the capsule.

289
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,650
Your commander is still waiting for your report.

290
00:17:01,982 --> 00:17:05,062
For God's sake Barclay, do as he asks. Do you want the place destroyed?

291
00:17:06,228 --> 00:17:07,192
All right.

292
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,153
Come in Geneva.

293
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:18,509
Snowcap. What's going on? We received an emergency from you on the radio link.

294
00:17:18,894 --> 00:17:23,417
I-i-i-it was a fault. We're, we are looking at it now. I'm sorry about the false alarm.

295
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:28,042
Where is the static coming from? We can hardly hear you, even on these bands.

296
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:31,481
It it it, well, I-I-I, er think it must have been the reactor.

297
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:36,484
We had the moderator on, er, for a time this afternoon and er, well, well that's probably it.

298
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:42,450
I see. Contact us if you have any further reports on this new planet.

299
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:43,549
Yes sir.

300
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:47,719
Well done, Barclay. Now the space capsule will have another chance.

301
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,731
Now you must let us try and get in touch with our astronauts.

302
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:56,344
I told you it is impossible for them to get back now.

303
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:58,845
The force on them is too strong.

304
00:17:59,249 --> 00:18:01,034
But you must let us try, please.

305
00:18:01,336 --> 00:18:05,242
It is a foregone conclusion. You are wasting time.

306
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:09,223
However, if you wish to contact them I have no objection.

307
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:13,503
He and his colleagues may use their equipment.

308
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:17,896
Any attempt at deceit however, kill them at once.

309
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:22,696
Remove the soldier. I will carry on detail.

310
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:27,240
Snowcap to Zeus 4, come in please. Zeus 4, come in please.

311
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,869
We have you, over.

312
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:30,902
Prepare to check orbital density.

313
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:31,837
Ready.

314
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,402
Right Doctor, while they take him out we'll make a break for it.

315
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,038
Eh?

316
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:37,147
Then we can get back to the TARDIS!

317
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:38,271
Well how can we do that, boy?

318
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:42,226
Well, we can make a break for it. Down that corridor, the trapdoor and then bolt it from behind.

319
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:44,292
Nonsense, nonsense, they'll burn it down in a flash!

320
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,811
We can do with that for a start!

321
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:46,501
No, Ben!

322
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:48,615
If they see you... Ben, for goodness sake!

323
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:53,307
Stop! Come here.

324
00:19:01,443 --> 00:19:05,277
You do not seem to take us seriously.

325
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:13,442
Blimey!

326
00:19:14,527 --> 00:19:15,411
Heavens!

327
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:19,258
Take him out and look after him.

328
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:28,409
It is quite useless to resist us. We are stronger

329
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:33,609
and more efficient than your Earth people. We must be obeyed.

330
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:47,344
Uh! Locked... uh! No

331
00:20:03,823 --> 00:20:04,663
What happened?

332
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:10,367
I'm afraid the spaceship exploded, my dear.

333
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:12,924
You mean they're dead?

334
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:19,535
Now perhaps you can see that your planet is in great and imminent danger.

335
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:25,545
In order to save you we shall require information to be transmitted to Mondas.

336
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:26,660
Save us?

337
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,136
What about those poor men?

338
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:34,404
Perhaps you will co-operate. Mondas drew the ship away. It was unavoidable.

339
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:36,008
Why? What is happening?

340
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:37,734
I will require your name.

341
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:38,845
Tell us!

342
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,562
The energy of Mondas is nearly exhausted

343
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:47,572
and now we turn to it's twin and will gather energy from Earth.

344
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:48,720
Gather energy?!

345
00:20:48,946 --> 00:20:49,794
Age, name and occupation.

346
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:50,840
But for how long?

347
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,577
My name is John Dyson, supervising engineer.

348
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:55,418
Until it is all gone. Age.

349
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,781
But that means that the Earth will... will die!

350
00:20:58,002 --> 00:21:01,738
Yes. Everything on Earth will stop. Age please.

351
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,401
But you can't calmly stand there and tell us we're all going to die!

352
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:06,733
You are not going to die.

353
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:09,665
And how are you going to stop this energy drain from Mondas?

354
00:21:10,073 --> 00:21:13,658
Name and occupation please. We cannot. It is beyond our powers.

355
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:14,829
How are we going to survive?!

356
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:17,723
Speak please. By coming with us. Age.

357
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:19,182
With you?

358
00:21:19,497 --> 00:21:24,796
Yes. We are going to take you all back to Mondas. Your age please.

359
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,700
- His age is unimportant here!
- That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life!

360
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:29,058
You cannot for one moment...

361
00:21:36,918 --> 00:21:43,261
Hey, wait a minute! If I was to turn this on the door...

362
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:47,901
...it might blind him! Yeah.

363
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,238
Hah! I saw that film 20 years ago.

364
00:22:08,565 --> 00:22:12,741
Oy, come in here mate, you're wanted! Oy, come in here!

365
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:16,290
Blemmy ehny ah fu! Uh!

366
00:22:17,364 --> 00:22:18,777
Now then, Fred!

367
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,489
Ahh!

368
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:27,921
Do not resist. Give me that weapon.

369
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:32,359
No, I'm sorry mate, I'm giving the orders here. Now look, get back.

370
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:34,550
Look, I'm telling you, get back!

371
00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:39,488
You didn't give me no alternative!

372
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,741
There's no scientific certainty that this is a dying planet!

373
00:22:43,374 --> 00:22:45,321
Perhaps we would prefer to take our chances here.

374
00:22:45,337 --> 00:22:47,669
You must come and live with us.

375
00:22:47,897 --> 00:22:51,150
But we cannot live with you, you're... you're different, you've got no feelings.

376
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,146
Feelings? I do not understand that word.

377
00:22:55,409 --> 00:23:01,282
Emotions. Love, pride, hate, fear. Have you no emotions, sir?

378
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:06,262
Come to Mondas and you will have no need of emotions.

379
00:23:06,304 --> 00:23:08,462
You will become like us.

380
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:09,897
Like you?

381
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:17,856
We have freedom from disease, protection against heat and cold, true mastery.

382
00:23:17,957 --> 00:23:19,560
Do you prefer to die in misery?

383
00:23:19,918 --> 00:23:23,509
But look, surely I... it's possible for us not to lose Earth's energy?

384
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,606
It is inevitable.

385
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,517
Then you don't mind if we all die.

386
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,384
Why should we mind?

387
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,609
Why? Why?!

388
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:36,137
Because millions and millions of people are going to suffer and die horribly!

389
00:23:36,433 --> 00:23:38,586
We shall not be affected.

390
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:41,148
Don't you think of anything except yourselves?!

391
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:47,253
We are equipped to survive. We are only interested in survival.

392
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:53,753
Anything else is of no importance. Your deaths will not affect us.

393
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:58,298
But I can't make you understand, you're condemning us all to die, have you no heart?

394
00:23:58,564 --> 00:24:03,541
No, that is one of the weaknesses that we have removed.

395
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,671
All right, get me Geneva, quick!

396
00:24:13,304 --> 00:24:15,984
Come on, let's have some action. Get rid of these... things!

397
00:24:16,232 --> 00:24:19,884
I don't think you should have done that, General. We may have learned a very great deal.

398
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:22,703
Yeah, we may have lost a very great deal, our lives!

399
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:33,742
Missile control? Program all Cobra anti-missiles for launch imminent. Stand in readiness and await instructions.

400
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,123
What a ghastly man.

401
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:37,579
Yeah, I wouldn't want him on the bridge.

402
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:39,514
We'll soon have this place sealed up like a bottle.

403
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:42,467
I think you rather underestimate the Cybermen, General.

404
00:24:43,286 --> 00:24:45,537
Oh, that's what you reckon is it, old man?

405
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:49,537
Well, you're entitled to your opinions so long as you keep them to yourself!

406
00:24:50,764 --> 00:24:51,348
General Cutler, sir!

407
00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:52,079
Yes, what is it?

408
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:53,803
Strong signal on the early warning, unidentified.

409
00:24:56,891 --> 00:24:59,668
Yes sir, it's er, er... There are hundreds of them, sir!

410
00:24:59,879 --> 00:25:00,935
Hundreds of what, man?

411
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:02,522
Spaceships sir. In formation!

412
00:25:05,075 --> 00:25:08,689
Spaceships. That means only one thing, more Cybermen.

413
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:12,289
Dyson, see if you can get hold of Zeus 5, I want to speak to my son.

414
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:13,383
Trying now, sir.

415
00:25:14,394 --> 00:25:15,803
What's the matter, Doctor?

416
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:35,462
Dyson, get through to Zeus 5!

417
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:36,970
What's happened to you, Doctor?

418
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:43,636
I'm not sure, my dear. Comes from an outside influence. Unless this old body of mine is wearing a bit thin.

419
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,330
What do you mean "wearing a bit thin"?

420
00:25:45,486 --> 00:25:47,521
Oh, don't worry child, don't worry, don't worry... 

421
00:25:56,864 --> 00:26:04,657
Silence. Anyone who moves will be killed instantly.

422
00:26:05,224 --> 00:26:14,063
Your planet is finished. It will disintegrate. We know why you came here. So why not stay and live with us in peace, hmm?

423
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:21,438
We cannot talk while that missile is aimed at Mondas. It must be disarmed first.

424
00:26:21,668 --> 00:26:22,856
A moment, please.

425
00:26:23,205 --> 00:26:25,732
Are you able to disarm this rocket?

426
00:26:25,987 --> 00:26:26,589
Well, yes - but...

427
00:26:26,974 --> 00:26:27,797
It will give us the time we need!

428
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:29,030
The time for Mondas to burn itself out, you mean?

429
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:35,617
Yes, now quiet! We accept your terms. The warhead will be removed from the rocket.

430
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:39,676
It must be removed to below ground level.

431
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:41,871
Well, there's the Radiation Room. It's the deepest in the base.

432
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:48,888
That will do. And to make sure you do this, we will take two hostages.

433
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:52,003
That girl will go to the spacecraft.

434
00:26:52,456 --> 00:26:55,812
Surely you're not going to return to Mondas now?

435
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:58,940
We will not discuss our plans with you.

436
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:05,161
What is your second objective? It's quite obvious, isn't it? The destruction of the Earth!

437
00:27:05,588 --> 00:27:20,998
Listen to me. This close proximity of our two planets means that one has to be eliminated for the safety of the other. The one to be destroyed will be Earth. We cannot allow Mondas to burn up.

438
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:24,733
Take the old man out to the spacecraft.

439
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,530
You will regret this.

440
00:27:35,078 --> 00:27:36,704
Doctor... Doctor?

441
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:39,079
Hmm... What is it, child?

442
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:43,320
Engines! They're not going to take off, are they?

443
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:52,394
No, no. Wait! The vibrations. Perhaps it's coming from Mondas!

444
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:54,006
What do you mean, Mondas?

445
00:27:54,245 --> 00:28:00,664
This spacecraft receives its energy from Mondas. Perhaps it's absorbing too much.

446
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:03,523
Don't mean it's going to blow up, do you?

447
00:28:03,796 --> 00:28:06,525
No, I don't know, child. It is an unknown power...

448
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:10,051
Doctor, I'm scared!

449
00:28:10,376 --> 00:28:13,481
Just look at Mondas! I can't believe it!

450
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:24,829
Fantastic! It looks as if it's melting!

451
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,585
It's falling to bits!

452
00:28:29,102 --> 00:28:31,072
The end of Mondas.

453
00:28:31,614 --> 00:28:33,078
Hey, look!

454
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,171
What's happened to them?

455
00:28:42,857 --> 00:28:44,920
They've disintegrated!

456
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:49,986
They must have been entirely dependent on power from Mondas!

457
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,041
Doctor!

458
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:56,307
Ben! Oh please, Ben, help me... get me out of this thing!

459
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,118
All right, don't panic, I'll have you out soon!

460
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:03,649
Ow! My hands were stuck and I couldn't get out!... Ben, I've been so scared!

461
00:29:03,864 --> 00:29:05,216
Take it easy love, take it easy.

462
00:29:05,404 --> 00:29:08,194
And that Cyberman thing, it just fizzled into nothing, Ben, it was awful...

463
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:09,778
Now what's the matter with the Doctor?

464
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,536
I don't know. When the lights went out, he just seemed to faint.

465
00:29:11,704 --> 00:29:14,463
Hey, come on Doctor, wakey wakey! It's all over now.

466
00:29:22,402 --> 00:29:23,907
What did you say, my boy?

467
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,800
"It's all over. " That's what you said. 

468
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:45,000
No... but it isn't all over. It's far from being all over.

469
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,439
Wait for us!

470
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:47,517
Open the door!

471
00:29:47,546 --> 00:29:48,468
Hey, let us in!

472
00:29:48,594 --> 00:29:51,218
You can't leave us here, of all places! Open up!

473
00:29:51,462 --> 00:29:52,295
Doctor!

474
00:30:20,604 --> 00:30:22,383
Doctor! Quick, help him!

475
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:23,714
No, leave him!
