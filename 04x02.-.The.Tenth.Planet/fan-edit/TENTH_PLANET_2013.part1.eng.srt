2
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:50,061
Man, it's blowing like crazy out there. All I can see is snow, snow and more snow.

3
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:31,007
Quite an arctic storm blowing out there. Hmm! Come along Polly, my child, with my cloak.

4
00:01:31,316 --> 00:01:33,023
Hey Doctor, you've got the most fantastic wardrobe!

5
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:34,765
Yes, well I'm glad you approve my child.

6
00:01:35,255 --> 00:01:37,503
These are gorgeous. Where do you shop, Carnaby street?! Ha ha!

7
00:01:37,702 --> 00:01:39,293
Who do you think you are, Nanook of the North or something?!

8
00:01:39,477 --> 00:01:41,406
Oh now, now, now. Tcha, tcha, tcha. Stop being so flippant.

9
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:45,606
We don't know what we are in for outside there. Now come along, come along, come along.

10
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:46,933
Here you are, Doctor.

11
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:49,061
Are you sure you're going to be warm enough?

12
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:52,367
Oh, like toast my dear. Now, did you find everything you want?

13
00:01:52,415 --> 00:01:53,067
Yes thanks!

14
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:55,570
All right, well let's go outside and investigate. Go along.

15
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,241
The Doctor was right about this being the coldest place on earth. I'm freezing already.

16
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,930
Yeah.

17
00:02:08,153 --> 00:02:09,076
Hey, what's this?

18
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,503
Well watch it Polly!

19
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:14,849
It's some kind of an aerial. There must be something buried underneath there.

20
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:17,645
Hey, look over there, there's something moving.

21
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,718
Hey Tito, will you come over here?

22
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,549
Oh, what is it?

23
00:02:30,756 --> 00:02:32,901
Come over here quick! I can see people!

24
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:35,102
Sure, sure, lots of people!

25
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:37,211
- And there's a woman!   - A woman...

26
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:38,974
A WOMAN! Hey!

27
00:02:41,336 --> 00:02:48,213
Hey, hey! Mama Mia bellissima!

28
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:54,329
Looks... looks like some kind of a hut.

29
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,429
Quick, take those small arms, get upstairs and get... bring them down. Get moving!

30
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:08,516
I think we'd better go with 'em.

31
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:19,462
Move it, come on, hurry it up, come on, let's go, let's go, come on pops,

32
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,460
Will you move it, will you move it pops, let's go, come on!

33
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:22,996
Please stop that. Please, please stop that.

34
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:26,297
Just a moment pops. Now who are you, and what are you doing here?

35
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:27,865
Oh, we just landed outside.

36
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:30,647
- What in?  - Well it's a sort of spaceship actually.

37
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,806
- Ha ha! Some spaceship, box!   - You can knock off the jokes.

38
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:33,350
She's not joking.

39
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:35,434
Look buddy, I want the truth, and quick.

40
00:03:35,642 --> 00:03:37,259
Can you tell us precisely where we are please?

41
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,422
You're at the South Pole base of international space command, and frankly pops...

42
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,146
Doctor.

43
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,222
...Doctor, your story's gonna have to be awful good.

44
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,506
So you mean we are on Earth?

45
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,115
Well you heard, the South Pole.

46
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,588
Oh boy. Tito, get the CO.

47
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:51,020
He's a-not going to like it.

48
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:51,918
Get him!

49
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:53,473
Why don't you speak up, I'm deaf!

50
00:03:53,724 --> 00:03:54,847
Who's the CO?

51
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,250
The Commanding Officer, the boss.

52
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,826
Hallo... Sir? Er, Private Tito, duty guard here.

53
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:02,826
Could you give a message to the General please?

54
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:05,066
- General?  - General Cutler, the CO.

55
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:11,535
Sir? I know, but this is an emergency! What's that? The General's not there?

56
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:13,514
Well canna you tell me where he is then?

57
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:14,863
Right here, Private.

58
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,800
What is it Sergeant?

59
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:19,501
Ah, well sir...

60
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,228
Who are these people?

61
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:23,741
Well sir, they just appeared outside.

62
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:24,487
What?

63
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:27,279
Yes sir, as I said they just appeared, from a hut.

64
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:28,350
A hut?!

65
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes sir. Never been there before.

66
00:04:30,206 --> 00:04:32,444
That's a right General. That's just the way it happened.

67
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:39,530
Well? Who are you?

68
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,575
Able seaman Ben Jackson sir, Royal Navy.

69
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,907
Then why aren't you with your ship?

70
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,008
That's a bit difficult to explain sir.

71
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,714
Yeah, I'll bet my sweet life it is.

72
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:49,671
We don't intend you any harm General, I can assure you of that.

73
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:54,832
You can assure me of what you like, but whether I'll believe you or not is another question.

74
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:56,089
Huh, huh!

75
00:04:56,912 --> 00:05:01,437
I haven't got time to deal with these now, but when I do you'd better have a good explanation.

76
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:03,690
I don't like your tone, sir.

77
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:06,591
And I don't like your face, nor your hair!

78
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:07,378
Hmm!

79
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:10,454
Sergeant, bring him into Tracking and put him under guard in the observation room.

80
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,524
I'll deal with them as soon as I have time.

81
00:05:14,123 --> 00:05:14,425
Yes sir!

82
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:22,808
OK, come on, move...

83
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:32,195
Hey, this is smashing. It looks just like that rocket place in America.

84
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:33,632
Yeah, but I wonder why there are so few people.

85
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,260
I mean it's not like what you see on the telly, is it?

86
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:36,824
I don't know what you see on your TV, son,

87
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,524
but this is General Cutler's outfit. Come on, you'd better take a seat.

88
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:43,668
He don't like a lot of personnel, cuts down to the bare minimum and works them right into the ground.

89
00:05:43,773 --> 00:05:47,664
We only spend a couple of months on this station anyway. We can't stand more than that.

90
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:48,399
Ha ha ha!

91
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,823
I see. Hey, perhaps we can catch a lift back to England.

92
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:53,228
Oh, I can't see the squire there giving us a free lift to anywhere.

93
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:57,968
Well I don't want to depress you both but I'm afraid we're not quite where you think we are.

94
00:05:58,187 --> 00:05:58,891
- What do you mean?  - What?

95
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:01,732
Well, just take a peek at that. Huh huh! Hmm!

96
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:06,316
1986! Oh no, and I thought we'd be able to get home.

97
00:06:06,585 --> 00:06:09,855
Yeah, we're still at sea. Here, but that'll explain the few people.

98
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,295
The computers must do all the work now. Here, I wonder if they got to the moon yet.

99
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:15,564
Sure, don't you listen to the news?

100
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:16,917
You mean you have sent people to the moon?

101
00:06:17,137 --> 00:06:18,658
Yeah, an expedition just returned.

102
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,127
Well what's this flight then?

103
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:22,125
Oh, this is just a normal atmosphere testing probe.

104
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:24,461
Yes, I see, a rocket testing site. Hum hum!

105
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:25,574
Hey, what's that?

106
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:26,866
An error? Where?

107
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:32,914
Looks bad. We're now over south isle of New Zealand and reading a height of 1100 miles.

108
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:36,696
1100? But that's impossible! Dyson, check what it should be, will you?

109
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,776
It should be 980.

110
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,923
No, it can't be, let me try.

111
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:41,218
Let me do it.

112
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:47,971
No, you're right. 980 miles... they're out of position by more than a hundred miles!

113
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:48,923
Mmm, looks like it.

114
00:06:49,203 --> 00:06:50,707
Snowcap to Zeus 4. Can you read me?

115
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:54,050
Zeus 4 to Snowcap. Strength 8, over.

116
00:06:54,354 --> 00:06:57,250
Take visual checks on Mars to establish position. Report back.

117
00:06:57,285 --> 00:07:00,658
Here we are. Well now, excuse me my dear...

118
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:01,949
...er, take this to your General please.

119
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:02,972
Me? Are you crazy?

120
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:05,695
Very well then, take me to the General. I think perhaps I can help him.

121
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,882
Oh I... I don't know.

122
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:08,859
Now look here Sergeant, this is urgent, I insist.

123
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,899
General, sir.

124
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:14,808
Yes, what is it?

125
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:16,675
The old boy would like to have a word with you. Claims it's urgent.

126
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,931
OK, bring him over. But make it fast.

127
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:21,467
I think I know what you are going to see.

128
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,130
How can you possibly? Oh, get him back over there.

129
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:25,999
I've written down here what he will see.

130
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:27,267
Take your hands off me please!

131
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:29,068
Barclay! It's not very clear but it's a planet all right.

132
00:07:29,277 --> 00:07:31,046
How could it be? Planets don't just appear.

133
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:32,503
It must be on a weak orbit.

134
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:35,251
It's approaching quite fast. Barclay, couldn't it be...

135
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:39,946
I know what you're thinking. Zeus 4 is out of orbit and a new planet has appeared.

136
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,046
Therefore the new planet is influencing Zeus 4. Right?

137
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:44,097
That's about it.

138
00:07:44,307 --> 00:07:45,510
We must get them down!

139
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:47,283
An emergency splash zone?

140
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:55,796
Yes. Snowcap calling Zeus 4, come in please. Zeus 4 come in please. Do you read me?

141
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:57,839
Yes, we read you loud and clear.

142
00:07:58,112 --> 00:08:02,240
You are strength 2 only. Come in please, speak up.

143
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:04,660
Fuel cells are showing a power loss.

144
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:05,721
Power loss?

145
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,029
Its gravity is affecting the capsule.

146
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:09,158
What shall we do about it?

147
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,200
Well first of all we must give Zeus 4 a new correction path. Will you do that?

148
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:12,869
Right away.

149
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,381
You try and get a better fix on that so-called planet and see what it is.

150
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:15,992
Right sir.

151
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:16,929
It's better now.

152
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:21,180
You say you know what this planet is. Well what is it?

153
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:24,205
Well I'm not quite sure sir. Let me have another look into this instrument.

154
00:08:25,744 --> 00:08:28,386
Feed the retina scope into the observations room's monitor.

155
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:30,907
Look Dr Barclay, let's just get those boys down.

156
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,676
General, General, yes, it's just as I thought.

157
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:35,576
Come and have a look at these land masses.

158
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:38,978
Land masses? I don't see... I see what you mean.

159
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,735
Now, doesn't that remind you of anything, hmm?

160
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:43,283
Remind? No, I don't think so.

161
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:44,729
Yeah, it looks familiar somehow.

162
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:50,531
Yeah. Hey Ben, look, that bit looks just like... Malaysia!

163
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:57,343
Oh, give over. No, hang on, isn't that... well it looks like South America but it can't be though!

164
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,686
Yes, there is a similarity.

165
00:08:58,779 --> 00:08:59,892
Nonsense, how could there be?

166
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:01,722
This is unbelievable. That's surely Africa?

167
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:04,346
Yes, certainly and that is Malaysia!

168
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:06,767
Ridiculous. There must be some reflection of Earth.

169
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,527
No it can't be, there's nothing to reflect on!

170
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:12,321
And now my dear Dr Barclay I suggest you look at that piece of paper I gave you.

171
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:13,918
Paper? Oh yes...

172
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,114
You knew!

173
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:20,958
Certainly.

174
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,831
Knew what?

175
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:25,889
He has correctly written down what we have just seen and he did it before we saw it.

176
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:28,620
Oh, it's a... simple confidence trick, that's all.

177
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,404
No, I know when he gave me the paper.

178
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:34,009
Now, you clearly know something more about the situation. Can you be more explicit?

179
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:36,690
Yes sir, I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can.

180
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,290
You see, millions of years ago there was a twin planet to Earth and...

181
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:41,783
Oh, for heaven's sake!

182
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,962
Roger, Zeus 4...

183
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,403
Get me Geneva on the radio link.

184
00:09:47,864 --> 00:09:49,294
We'll see what Wigner has to say about this.

185
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:51,806
You're looking terribly worried Doctor.

186
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:55,283
Am I my dear? Yes, I'm afraid I am rather worried.

187
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:56,211
What is it Doctor? What's up?

188
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,846
Well you see Ben, I know what this planet is and what it means to Earth.

189
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,083
And what does it mean to Earth?

190
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:03,831
Well, that pretty soon we shall be having visitors.

191
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:09,968
Now, suppose you tell me how you really came here.

192
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:11,742
Yes, well I'm afraid all that's going to be rather difficult.

193
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:16,966
Now just a minute. You turn up out of nowhere, a routine space shot goes wrong...

194
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,466
a new planet appears and you tell us you know all about it. That puts you slap bang in the hot seat, right

195
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:23,776
Hot seat?

196
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:25,914
But we've got nothing to do with it.

197
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,047
That you're going to have to prove.

198
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:31,362
Well, I think if you allowed us to return where we came from, huh, huh! I...

199
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,189
You're not going anywhere.

200
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:38,953
- Sergeant?  - Yes sir?

201
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:40,955
- Have you searched that hut yet?  - No, sir

202
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:46,355
Well why not?! Look, I don't want any excuses, get out there and do it immediately.

203
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:53,133
Now, perhaps we'll get to the bottom of this.

204
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,722
Come on Tito, we have to go break into a hut.

205
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,265
What, that thing out there?

206
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,252
Yeah, that's right. Come on, hurry up and get dressed up.

207
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:00,300
Oh, mama.

208
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:23,334
It's no good Tito, we'll need a welding torch to get inside this thing.

209
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,200
Get back inside and bring me out one. You'll need some help, OK?

210
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:30,233
Hurry up will ya, before I freeze to death!

211
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:41,134
What the heck? Huh, Tito! Is that you Tito?

212
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,709
What's going on here? Who is that?

213
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:54,643
Who the heck are you?!

214
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:03,608
OK Joe, that should do it. OK, let's go.

215
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:16,053
Hey, this is where it is guys.
