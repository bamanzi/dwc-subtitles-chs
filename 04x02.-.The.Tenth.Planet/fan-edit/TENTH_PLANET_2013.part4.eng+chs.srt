1
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:35,462
Dyson, get through to Zeus 5!

2
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:36,970
What's happened to you, Doctor?
你怎么了, 博士？

3
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:43,636
I'm not sure, my dear. Comes from an outside influence. Unless this old body of mine is wearing a bit thin.
我也不太确定, 亲爱的．是外界来的影响, 看样子我这把老骨头有点撑不住了．fixme

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,330
What do you mean "wearing a bit thin"?
＂撑不住了＂？什么意思？

你的星球完蛋了．它将会碎掉．我们知道你们为什么来这里

00:26:11,224 --> 00:26:14,063
So why not stay and live with us in peace, hmm?
所以为什么不坐下来, 与我们和平相处呢, 嗯？

9
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:21,438
We cannot talk while that missile is aimed at Mondas. It must be disarmed first.
如果导弹还对着 Mondas, 我们不能和谈．必须先把它卸掉．

10
00:26:21,668 --> 00:26:22,856
A moment, please.
请等一下．

11
00:26:23,205 --> 00:26:25,732
Are you able to disarm this rocket?
你能够将火箭解除武装吗？

12
00:26:25,987 --> 00:26:26,589
Well, yes - but...
哦, 可以 - 不过．．．

13
00:26:26,974 --> 00:26:27,797
It will give us the time we need!
这可以帮我们争取时间，我们正需要这个！

14
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:29,030
The time for Mondas to burn itself out, you mean?
好让 Mondas 自己烧毁, 是这意思吗？

15
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:35,617
Yes, now quiet! We accept your terms. The warhead will be removed from the rocket.
是的, 安静！ 我们接受你们的条件, 弹头将会从火箭上拆卸下来．

16
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:39,676
It must be removed to below ground level.
弹头必须移动到地下去．

17
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:41,871
Well, there's the Radiation Room. It's the deepest in the base.
这样, 有个辐射室, 是这个基地最深的地方．

18
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:48,888
That will do. And to make sure you do this, we will take two hostages.
那倒可以．为了确保你们能做到, 我们将扣留两人做人质

19
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:52,003
That girl will go to the spacecraft.
那个女孩儿, 到我们的飞船去

20
00:26:52,456 --> 00:26:55,812
Surely you're not going to return to Mondas now?

21
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:58,940
We will not discuss our plans with you.
我们不会跟你们讨论我们的计划

22
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:05,161
What is your second objective? It's quite obvious, isn't it? The destruction of the Earth!
你们的第二目标是什么？ 昭然若揭了, 对不对, 就是要毁灭地球！

23
00:27:05,588 --> 00:27:08,998
Listen to me. This close proximity of our two planets means that /?
请我说, 我们两个星球靠得太近

24
00:27:09,188 --> 00:27:13,998
one has to be eliminated for the safety of the other.
这意味着要保障其中一个的安全, 就得毁灭另外一个

25
00:27:13,588 --> 00:27:20,998
The one to be destroyed will be Earth. We cannot allow Mondas to burn up.
将被毁灭的是地球, 我们不可能让 Mondas 烧毁

26

Hmm... What is it, child?
唔．．．怎么了, 孩子？

30
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:43,320
Engines! They're not going to take off, are they?
引擎！他们不打算起飞, 是吧？

31
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:52,394
No, no. Wait! The vibrations. Perhaps it's coming from Mondas!
不, 不． 等等！ 这个振动, 也许是来自 Mondas!

32
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:54,006
What do you mean, Mondas?
Mondas? 什么意思？

33
00:27:54,245 --> 00:28:00,664
This spacecraft receives its energy from Mondas. Perhaps it's absorbing too much.
这艘飞船是从 Mondas 接收能量的, 可能 Mondas 吸收能量吸收得太多了

34
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:03,523
Don't mean it's going to blow up, do you?
是不是意味着它就要爆炸了, 是吗？

35
00:28:03,796 --> 00:28:06,525
No, I don't know, child. It is an unknown power...

Doctor, I'm scared!

Just look at Mondas! I can't believe it!

Fantastic! It looks as if it's melting!

They must have been entirely dependent on power from Mondas!
他们一定完全依靠 Mondas 提供能量

45
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,041
Doctor!
博士！

46
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:56,307
Ben! Oh please, Ben, help me... get me out of this thing!
Ben! 哦, 请, Ben, 帮我一下．．．把我带出这里！

47
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,118
All right, don't panic, I'll have you out soon!
好的, 别慌, 我马上把你弄出去！

48
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:03,649
Ow! My hands were stuck and I couldn't get out!... Ben, I've been so scared!
哦！ 我的手卡住了, 弄不出来！．．．Ben, 我很害怕

00:29:03,864 --> 00:29:05,216
Take it easy love, take it easy.

Now what's the matter with the Doctor?
博士这是怎么了？

52
