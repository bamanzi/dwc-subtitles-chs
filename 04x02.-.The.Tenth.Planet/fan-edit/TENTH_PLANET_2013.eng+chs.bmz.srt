Barclay! It's not very clear but it's a planet all right.
Barclay！这不是太清楚但应该是一颗行星

135
00:07:29,277 --> 00:07:31,046
How could it be? Planets don't just appear.
这怎么可能？行星不可能就这么出现了

136
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:32,503
It must be on a weak orbit.
它肯定是在一个弱轨道上

137
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:35,251
It's approaching quite fast. Barclay, couldn't it be...
它正在快速接近．Barclay，它会不会...

138
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:39,946
I know what you're thinking. Zeus 4 is out of orbit and a new planet has appeared.
我知道你在想什么．宙斯4号偏离了轨道，又有一颗行星出现了...

139
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,046
Therefore the new planet is influencing Zeus 4. Right?
所以这颗行星会影响宙斯4号，对吧

140
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:44,097
That's about it.
就是这么回事

141
00:07:44,307 --> 00:07:45,510
We must get them down!
我们必须把他们弄下来！

142
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:47,283
An emergency splash zone?
一个紧急溅射区域？

143
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:55,796
Yes. Snowcap calling Zeus 4, come in please. Zeus 4 come in please. Do you read me?
是．雪冠呼叫宙斯4号，请回话．宙斯4号请回话．你们能否听到？

144
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:57,839
Yes, we read you loud and clear.
听到，声音响亮而清晰

145
00:07:58,112 --> 00:08:02,240
You are strength 2 only. Come in please, speak up.

146
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:04,660
Fuel cells are showing a power loss.

147
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:05,721
Power loss? 
能量流失？

148
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,029
Its gravity is affecting the capsule.
它的引力在影响太空舱

149
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:09,158
What shall we do about it?
我们怎么对付这个？

150
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,200
Well first of all we must give Zeus 4 a new correction path. Will you do that?
首先我们必须给宙斯4号一条修正路线，你能搞定吗？

151
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:12,869
Right away.
马上

152
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,381
You try and get a better fix on that so-called planet and see what it is.
你就尽力跟进那个所谓的行星，搞明白到底是个什么东西

153
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:15,992
Right sir.

154
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:16,929
It's better now.

155
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:21,180
You say you know what this planet is. Well what is it?
你说你知道这个行星是什么，那它是什么？

156
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:24,205
Well I'm not quite sure sir. Let me have another look into this instrument.
呃我也不是太确定长官．我再去看一眼仪表

157
00:08:25,744 --> 00:08:28,386
Feed the retina scope into the observations room's monitor.
把高清镜头的画面投到观察室的显示器上

158
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:30,907
Look Dr Barclay, let's just get those boys down.
Barclay 博士，我们去把那些小伙子弄下来

00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,676
General, General, yes, it's just as I thought. 
将军，将军，是的，的确如我所料

160
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:35,576
Come and have a look at these land masses.
过来看看这些大陆板块

161
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:38,978
Land masses? I don't see... I see what you mean.

162
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,735
Now, doesn't that remind you of anything, hmm?
现在，有没有想起一点什么？

163

Remind? No, I don't think so.

164
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:44,729
Yeah, it looks familiar somehow.

Yeah. Hey Ben, look, that bit looks just like... Malaysia!
是啊，嘿 Ben，看，那块看起来像是...马来西亚

166
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:57,343
Oh, give over. No, hang on, isn't that... well it looks like South America but it can't be though!
哦，算了吧．不，等等，那不是...看起来像是南美洲，但这不可能啊！

167
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,686
Yes, there is a similarity.
的确，有一些相似性

168
00:08:58,779 --> 00:08:59,892
Nonsense, how could there be?

169
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:01,722
This is unbelievable. That's surely Africa?

Yes, certainly and that is Malaysia!

171
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:06,767
Ridiculous. There must be some reflection of Earth.
荒谬，肯定是某个地方反射出了地球的样子

172
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,527
No it can't be, there's nothing to reflect on!
这不可能，没有什么可反射的物质啊

173
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:12,321
And now my dear Dr Barclay I suggest you look at that piece of paper I gave you.

179
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:28,620
Oh, it's a... simple confidence trick, that's all.
哦，这是个...简单的障眼法，仅此而已

180
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,404
No, I know when he gave me the paper.
不，我知道他什么时候给我这张纸的

181

Now, you clearly know something more about the situation. Can you be more explicit?
对于当前的情况，你显然还知道些什么，你能说得更明白点吗

Yes sir, I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can.
是的先生，很抱歉，恐怕我能

184
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:41,783
Oh, for heaven's sake!

00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,962
Roger, Zeus 4...
收到，宙斯4号...

186
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,403
Get me Geneva on the radio link.
给我接通日内瓦的无线电连接

187
00:09:47,864 --> 00:09:49,294
We'll see what Wigner has to say about this.

You're looking terribly worried Doctor.

193
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:03,831
Well, that pretty soon we shall be having visitors.

194
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:09,968
Now, suppose you tell me how you really came here.
现在，想来你可以告诉我，你实际上怎么来这里的

Yes, well I'm afraid all that's going to be rather difficult.
可以，只是恐怕那会相当困难

196
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:16,966
Now just a minute. You turn up out of nowhere, a routine space shot goes wrong...
等一等，你不知道从哪儿就钻出来了，例行的飞船发射出了问题...

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,466
a new planet appears and you tell us you know all about it. That puts you slap bang in the hot seat, right
一个新的行星冒出来了，你又说你对它很了解，fixme

198
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:23,776
Hot seat?

199
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:25,914
But we've got nothing to do with it.

200
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,047
That you're going to have to prove.

为什么没有？我不想要任何借口，立即出去把这事办了

Now, perhaps we'll get to the bottom of this.

这没用的 Tito，我们要用焊枪才能进得去这里

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,200
Get back inside and bring me out one. You'll need some help, OK?
回到里面去，给我拿一个出来，找两个帮忙的，行吗？

... devised spare parts for our bodies until we could be almost completely replaced.
......为我们的身体器官设计了备件，直到我们几乎全身被替换掉

但是...这就是说你们跟我们不一样，你们是机器人！

但是...那也太糟了! 你是说你们不会关系痛苦的人？

What's happened to you, Doctor?

420
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:40,636
I'm not sure, my dear. Comes from an outside influence.

这样，有个辐射室，是这个基地最深的地方．

This close proximity of our two planets means that...
我们两个星球靠得太近...

442
00:27:09,188 --> 00:27:13,598
one has to be eliminated for the safety of the other.
这意味着要保障其中一个的安全，就得毁灭另外一个

What do you mean, Mondas?
Mondas? 什么意思？

451
00:27:54,245 --> 00:28:00,664
This spacecraft receives its energy from Mondas. Perhaps it's absorbing too much.
这艘飞船是从 Mondas 接收能量的，可能它吸收得太多了

452
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:03,723
Don't mean it's going to blow up, do you?

哦！ 我的手卡住了，弄不出来！．．．Ben, 我很害怕

Now what's the matter with the Doctor?
