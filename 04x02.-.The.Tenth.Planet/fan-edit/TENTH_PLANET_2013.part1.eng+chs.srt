是啊，不过我好奇为什么人那么少

我是说并不像你在电视上看见的那样，是不？

我不知道你在电视上看到的是怎样的，小子

是，我们还在海上．对了，这就解释了为什么这么少人了

所有的工作现在肯定是电脑干．嗨，我好奇他们登上月球没有

Sure, don't you listen to the news?

You mean you have sent people to the moon?

An error? Where?
有错误？哪里？

看起来不对，我们现在在新西兰南岛上空，高度数值是1100英里

1100? But that's impossible! Dyson, check what it should be, will you?
1100？那不可能啊！Dyson，检查设定值，好吗？

131
00:07:29,277 --> 00:07:31,046
How could it be? Planets don't just appear.

It must be on a weak orbit.

It's approaching quite fast. Barclay, couldn't it be...

我知道你在想什么．宙斯4号偏离了轨道，又有一颗行星出现了...

135
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,046
Therefore the new planet is influencing Zeus 4. Right?

哦，算了吧．不，等等，那不是...看起来像是南美洲，但这不可能啊！

No it can't be, there's nothing to reflect on!
这不可能，没有什么可反射的物质啊

Yes, well I'm afraid all that's going to be rather difficult.
可以，只是恐怕那会相当困难

等一等，你不知道从哪儿就钻出来了，例行的飞船发射出了问题...

But we've got nothing to do with it.
