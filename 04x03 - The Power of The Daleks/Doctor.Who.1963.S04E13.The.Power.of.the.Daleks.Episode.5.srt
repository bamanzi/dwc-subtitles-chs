Dalek nine complete.

3
00:01:32,914 --> 00:01:33,365
Check.

4
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:36,511
We are the new race of Daleks!

5
00:01:36,883 --> 00:01:38,111
Dalek ten complete.

6
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:38,931
Check.

7
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,224
Dalek eleven complete.

8
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,097
Check.

9
00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:42,412
Dalek twelve complete.

10
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,300
Check.

11
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:44,780
Dalek thirteen complete.

12
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:45,530
Check.

00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:47,823
Check.

Dalek fifteen complete.

16
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:50,067
Check.

17

Dalek sixteen complete.

18
00:01:51,675 --> 00:01:52,008
Check.

19
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,412
Dalek seventeen complete.

20
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,048
Check.

21
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:55,811
Dalek eighteen complete.

22
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:27,937
What's the matter? What is it?

23
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:29,744
Are you ill?

24
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:35,743
They're in there - making themselves! Duplicating!

25
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,360
What? What are you talking about?

26
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:41,182
I started this, opening the capsule!

27
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:42,109
Lesterson!

28
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:43,418
Don't try to stop me!

29
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:44,465
What happened?

30
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:59,077
They forget that I control them! I gave them life back again, and now I've taken it away! Finished! Stopped it!

31
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:00,518
The Daleks...

32
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:15,314
Evil! Horrible! I know what I'm going to do! Laser torches! Melt them down! I'm going to melt the Daleks down to pools of metal!

33
00:03:15,554 --> 00:03:16,503
You won't Lesterson!

34
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:27,098
Ah, do you think I care what you can do?! Go on, tell everybody I was responsible for Resno's death! I don't care! I'm going to wipe out the Daleks!

35
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,648
Yes, tell everybody all about me! I'm still going to... I'm going to... wipe out the Daleks!

36
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:46,361
Get me the Examiner. Prison? Who put him there? But I've got to talk to him! I've got to, don't you understand?!

37
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:58,332
How did you get there?! I cut off the power!

38
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:03,993
We can store power. We will soon have our own.

39
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:06,347
Own power?!

40
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:09,488
Why was the capsule door closed?

41
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,305
Own power?! Ahh!

42
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,720
Seal off the capsule's secret entrance.

43
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:25,072
I obey.

44
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:26,983
Wait!

45
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:33,588
No more than three Daleks to be seen together at any one time.

46
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:35,061
I obey.

47
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:44,203
We are not ready yet to teach these human beings the law of the Daleks.

48
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:49,848
You can help me!

49
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:51,052
What's the matter?

50
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,211
Where... where's the Examiner?! I _?!

51
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:54,523
The Examiner's in prison.

52
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:56,863
Ah, yes.

53
00:04:57,103 --> 00:04:58,233
What's the matter with you?

54
00:04:58,551 --> 00:04:59,214
I forgot.

55
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,472
What are you running for? Hey!

56
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:10,111
Did Lesterson come back?

57
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:14,595
No. Why is this human restricted?

58
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:16,384
She's against the Daleks.

59
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:22,021
Afraid, are you? Nothing's going to happen to you if you behave.

60
00:05:22,227 --> 00:05:24,123
The Daleks? Of course I'm afraid - and so should you be.

61
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:25,685
The Daleks are going to help us.

62
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:28,053
'Us' being the rebels, I suppose.

63
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,151
If you like.

64
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:34,921
And when you've won, the Daleks will just go back to being servants again? You're bigger fools than I thought.

65
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:37,355
We are your servants.

66
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:38,758
While it suits you.

67
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:39,577
You'll see.

68
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:40,424
In!

69
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:41,771
you want me to stay with her?

70
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:47,851
Yes. You may have to help Valmar. He'll be here in a minute to fix up the new Dalek cower... power cable.

71
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:48,558
Right.

72
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:53,018
When will the work be completed?

73
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:56,256
What is this cable you Daleks are laying, anyway?

74
00:05:56,475 --> 00:06:00,564
Daleks operate on static electricity.

75
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,552
Static! Is that possible?

76
00:06:03,757 --> 00:06:08,906
To create static, the Daleks need a complete cable circuit.

77
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:14,480
I see. You convert our electricity into your own power.

78
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:20,049
That is correct. When will the human being complete the work?

79
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:25,769
He'll be here. It's easier now. There's no-one to interfere with our plans.

80
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:38,257
Do you have to do that? I'm afraid you'll find these locks are foolproof.

81
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:39,998
I wonder how they're converting the power?

82
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:41,949
Wha... What are you talking about?

83
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:47,478
The Daleks - they're powered by static electricity. It's like blood to them - a constant life-stream.

84
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:48,848
Static isn't workable!

85
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:54,300
It is to the Daleks. They've conquered static, just as they've conquered anti-magnetics.

86
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,317
I'm not going to listen to any more of this nonsense.

87
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:58,610
I don't seem to be able to hit the right note.

88
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:03,040
Do you have any more water?

89
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,065
I hope not. No.

90
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:07,139
Then I shall have to get some.

91
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,229
You can't!

92
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:10,723
But it's important! It's desperately important!

93
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:11,956
Well, Bragen gave orders.

94
00:07:12,153 --> 00:07:13,146
Just get out of my way!

95
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:14,930
Ah! Examiner! The Daleks...!

96
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:15,618
Yes?

97
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:18,893
They're duplicating! I've seen them!

98
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:22,711
They've got their own power now! I... I can't stop them!

99
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,148
Take him to Bragen.

100
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:26,369
Oh!... Oh!... Oh!...

101
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:32,453
I say. I say, do you think we might have a little more water?

102
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:39,439
Is that all you can say? Lesterson fights his way down here to speak to you and all you can do is demand more water?!

103
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:48,381
Get away from the door.

104
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:07,954
Sorry about that outburst. I thought it might help the situation.

105
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:16,079
Nearly... Nearly...

106
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:25,375
What's this?

107
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:27,425
He tried to break in and speak with the Examiner.

108
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:29,242
What is the Dalek doing?!

109
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:32,693
I thought you knew. Something to do with the emergency power supply.

110
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,998
Ah, no! It's... it's a trick! I didn't ask for it!

111
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:38,700
Lesterson, I've had reports.

112
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:40,133
What are you doing?!

113
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:49,347
Laying the new emergency power supply as you ordered, master.

114
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,812
It... it... it's a lie!

115
00:08:51,043 --> 00:08:53,715
I've had reports of your incomprehensible behaviour.

116
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:58,792
Yes. Yes, I... I can explain - if you'll get rid of that!

117
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:00,572
Finish now.

118
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:08,418
I am your servant.

119
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:14,865
Where is the Governor?!

120
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:15,824
At the perimeter. Why?

121
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:24,108
Call him! Get him back here as quickly as possible! We're all in terrible danger! The Examiner was right! Right all the time!

122
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:26,541
Don't listen to anything she has to say!

123
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:27,328
Come along now.

124
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:29,021
She's in league with the Daleks!

125
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:33,463
Now, now, now, now. Please, Lesterson. Let's just take things calmly, you're not well.

126
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,587
I'm perfectly well!

127
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:41,727
Please Lesterson, please. Now, you ought to be in hospital. You promised me you'd report there.

128
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:43,154
I promised nothing of the kind!

129
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:50,080
Don't you remember? Never mind. I understand.

130
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,778
Hmm. Pity. It's probably only temporary.

131
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:57,222
You're trying to say I'm mad!

132
00:09:57,487 --> 00:09:58,906
No. No, not mad.

133
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:00,553
No. Of course not. No.

134
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:06,483
But, I tell you, I saw the Daleks! They were duplicating! I saw it! I swear to you!

135
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:10,553
He suddenly started saying these things in the lab. I'm... I'm afraid, he's...

136
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:11,871
Oh, no! No!

137
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:15,704
Keep him under restraint.

138
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:20,200
Oh, will nobody listen to me?!

139
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:25,075
Pass me that small screwdriver.

140
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:29,249
I can't. My hands are tied. Anyway, I wouldn't help you, even if I could.

141
00:10:29,624 --> 00:10:30,186
OK.

142
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:35,409
More? I can't handle them.

143
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:36,522
This is the lot.

144
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:40,626
Listen. The Dalek's gone now.

145
00:10:40,822 --> 00:10:42,199
That doesn't mean you can start talking.

146
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:44,436
Oh, leave her alone, Kebble. She isn't doing any harm.

147
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:49,516
You think you're very tough don't you, pushing a girl around. I'd like to see you come up against a real man.

148
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:50,315
Like who?

149
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,547
Like Ben, for instance.

150
00:10:51,703 --> 00:10:53,716
Don't worry about him. We've got him safely stowed away.

151
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,352
You've got Ben?

152
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:58,637
He's sleeping off a slight fall.

153
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,264
I told you to leave her alone.

154
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:05,683
Your name's Valmar, isn't it?

155
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:06,707
That's it.

156
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:12,036
You want the Daleks to fight the Governor. But don't you see? They'll turn on you, too.

157
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:13,817
What? Three big pepper pots?

158
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:18,194
One of them did kill Resno. You saw what the Dalek did to that sheet of metal.

159
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:19,394
And that's just the beginning.

160
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:21,915
Don't listen to her. She's giving you the Examiner's line.

161
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:34,157
He isn't the Examiner. We're just travellers. Landed here by accident. The Doctor - that's the man you think is the Examiner - found the real Examiner dead, and picked up his papers.

162
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:40,215
This Doctor of yours. He knows something about the Daleks?

163
00:11:40,556 --> 00:11:44,090
He tried to warn everyone. It's the only reason we stayed here.

164
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:50,240
When will the work be completed?

165
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,660
I don't know. I'll need a new junction box like this one.

166
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,479
You've all underestimated these Daleks.

167
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:04,347
Better brains than us, I suppose.

168
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:09,723
I only know what the Doctor has told me - he says they're capable of exterminating whole nations.

169
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:13,741
Perhaps, but what would they want to kill us for - after we've taken over. We're friendly with the Daleks.

170
00:12:13,904 --> 00:12:17,888
But, don't you see? Human beings can't be friends with Daleks. They don't have friends.

171
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:19,189
I don't see why not.

172
00:12:19,894 --> 00:12:25,517
It's a kind of hatred for anything unlike themselves. They think they're superior.

173
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:29,155
The girl's got something.

174
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,439
You want to tell Janley? You're welcome!

175
00:12:31,623 --> 00:12:35,460
Janley! She'll betray the lot of you, if she gets the chance.

176
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,314
The other junction box is outside.

177
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:41,225
Thank you.

178
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:46,682
Talk too much, don't you? Didn't you know he was soft on Janley?

179
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:49,232
All right, all right, I'm just putting her straight.

180
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:50,917
More slack on the cables.

181
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:12,516
What are all these cables lying about?

182
00:13:12,682 --> 00:13:14,208
New emergency power supply.

183
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:15,523
Who's idea was that?

184
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,774
What do you want to know for?

185
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:20,247
What do I...?! Don't you know I'm the Governor?

186
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:21,833
Where are you from?

187
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:22,829
The interior, sir.

188
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:25,843
The interior? Why are you carrying a gun?

189
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:27,979
I'm a Squad Leader in Bragen's guard, sir.

190
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:35,435
Oh, I see. Bragen's guard, eh? All right, carry on.

191
00:13:44,874 --> 00:13:46,059
Cut that row out, you two!

192
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:02,290
Stop that.

193
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,396
Oh!

194
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:11,914
Come on.

195
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:12,882
Wait a minute!

196
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,540
We don't want him trying it, although he seemed a bit tone deaf to me.

197
00:14:39,774 --> 00:14:44,766
Well, Bragen - these trips are becoming more and more demanding.

198
00:14:45,195 --> 00:14:46,377
I didn't expect you, Governor.

199
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:50,578
Ah, I had as much as I could stand. Well? What's been happening here?

200
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:52,134
One moment.

201
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,771
I asked you a question, man.

202
00:14:54,331 --> 00:14:55,116
I heard you.

203
00:14:55,528 --> 00:15:00,183
Look, your work can wait. You can hand over to me tomorrow. I want to hear about the Examiner.

204
00:15:04,058 --> 00:15:06,367
The Examiner is at present in jail.

205
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,748
In jail? That's rather dangerous isn't it? Who put him there?

206
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:12,554
I did.

207
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:14,786
You did? In heaven's sake, why?

208
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:22,282
He's an impostor, Governor. Possibly a murderer as well. We have just discovered the body of the real Examiner in the mercury swamp.

209
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,596
I hope you're sure of your facts, Bragen.

210
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:27,530
Quite sure.

211
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:31,974
This could have far-reaching consequences.

212
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:36,437
As far as I am concerned, there's nothing more to be said. So if there's nothing further...

213
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:41,546
Nothing further! Who the devil do you think you're talking to? Stand up when you're speaking to me man!

214
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:45,045
I prefer to remain seated.

215
00:15:45,317 --> 00:15:49,096
Do you now?! We'll soon see about that. Guards!

216
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:51,577
Take this man out of my office.

217
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:55,079
Did you hear what I said? That's an order!

218
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,298
You forget, my dear Hensell. They're not your guards - they're mine.

219
00:15:58,456 --> 00:15:59,480
I am the Governor!

220
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:04,372
No. Not now. I am.

221
00:16:06,202 --> 00:16:15,387
Oh, I see. Your guards, eh? Yes, Quinn warned me about your guards, but we all took them too lightly, didn't we? But we'll soon change that.

222
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:26,218
You imbecile! How long do you think your handful of guards can hang out when the people hear that I am being kept a prisoner in my own capital?!

223
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,986
The people will do exactly as they are told, Hensell.

224
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:34,743
It will, of course, be easier for them if you co-operate with us.

225
00:16:53,086 --> 00:16:56,537
Wait there. Guards, dismissed.

226
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:05,605
So Bragen, you want my co-operation, do you?

227
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:10,636
It would save bloodshed. I might even let you keep the title of Governor.

228
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:18,308
Might you now?! I'll tell you what you will do. You'll order your guards to disarm and place yourself under arrest immediately!

229
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:23,543
So you reject my offer? I thought it a generous one in the circumstances.

230
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,310
What circumstances?

231
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:27,245
Look at this.

232
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:29,474
What is it?

233
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:32,022
The reason that the colony is now mine.

234
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:39,204
Is it a weapon of some kind?

235
00:17:39,421 --> 00:17:43,968
I'll arrange a demonstration for you. Do you still refuse my offer?

236
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:46,954
I will not be intimidated.

237
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:53,999
Of course not. In character to the last, Hensell. Kill him!

238
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:10,183
Why do human beings kill human beings?

239
00:18:10,402 --> 00:18:11,438
Get on with your work!

240
00:18:11,651 --> 00:18:14,218
Yes, master. I obey.

241
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:24,724
Yes, obey me! From now on, I will have complete obedience from everyone!

242
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:35,177
I'll have to check the cable circuit now. Otherwise, it's just as you asked for.

243
00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:37,331
Very well.

244
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:41,409
Why can't you carry on with the power you're drawing from the colony? Why go to all this trouble?

245
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:54,016
Until now, we have had to recharge from the colony supply. With static power, the Daleks will be twice as useful.

246
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:54,954
Valmar, quick!

247
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:55,787
What's the matter?

248
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:56,497
The Governor's back.

249
00:18:56,726 --> 00:18:57,380
What about the girl?

250
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:58,145
Leave her.

251
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,364
I will follow you.

252
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:00,268
What for?

253
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:02,640
I am your servant.

254
00:19:03,402 --> 00:19:03,886
Come on.

255
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:17,426
An electrical circuit of their own supplying static electricity! I wonder how much longer we've got?

256
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,198
I didn't realise they'd have a circuit of their own.

257
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,909
Doctor, look out!

258
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,430
Are you all right?

259
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:43,379
Well done! Who was the man who went outside just now?

260
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,288
Valmar. He's been working for the Daleks.

261
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,547
On their static power supply.

262
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:47,691
Doctor, they've got Ben.

263
00:19:47,828 --> 00:19:53,387
Yes, I know. He ran away so that I could... Oh well, it's a long story, but don't worry. That boy can take care of himself!

264
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,107
Did you hear that? That won't help.

265
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,061
Get out! All of you!

266
00:19:56,215 --> 00:19:56,992
What about you?!

267
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,907
But Doctor! Oh...

268
00:19:58,185 --> 00:19:58,793
Go!

269
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:24,900
Have they escaped?

270
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:28,875
Yes, return to capsule and report.

271
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:30,546
I obey.

272
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:52,449
We are to wait here until the human beings fight among themselves.

273
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:54,834
Then we will strike.

274
00:20:55,115 --> 00:21:15,066
And exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!

275
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,434
The one man who could have saved us.

276
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:22,111
Don't worry, the people will follow you, too.

277
00:21:22,274 --> 00:21:39,633
Maybe. But there wasn't any maybe about Hensell. He was old-fashioned. Single-minded, yes, but he's done a lot of wonderful work for this colony. Events turned out against him, that's all. But why? Why was he killed?

278
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,724
I can answer that.

279
00:21:40,891 --> 00:21:50,658
He wanted to destroy the Daleks, so one of them killed him. Now, I'm declaring martial law. You will be returned to prison, and properly guarded this time.

280
00:21:50,837 --> 00:21:54,059
Martial law! What good do you think that will do against the Daleks?

281
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:56,162
The Daleks will do as I tell them.

282
00:21:57,444 --> 00:21:59,259
We shall see, shan't we.

283
00:21:59,571 --> 00:22:00,529
Take them away.

284
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:18,764
Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!

285
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,555
Orders received. Exterminate all humans!

286
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:24,041
Exterminate all humans!

287
00:22:24,223 --> 00:22:30,312
Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy!

288
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:56,013
Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy!
