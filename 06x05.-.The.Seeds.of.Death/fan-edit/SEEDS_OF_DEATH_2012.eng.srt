You don't understand! It's suicide!

Listen, if this fault lasts much longer,

177
00:11:00,824 --> 00:11:05,181
there's going to be worldwide chaos,
and world population is at stake.

- Miss Kelly.
- Sir.

I want all technical personnel working on this.

I want that rocket prepared for launching!

Yes, Commander.

188
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:42,016
We'd be grateful for your help.

you'll need a miracle!

- Yes, Miss Kelly?

194
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,556
Is it wise letting these people crew the rocket?

195
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:23,236
What's the alternative?
We gave up training astronauts years ago.

196
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:26,514
- Who are they?
- Eldred's crazy friends, I imagine,

197
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:30,518
- but the Doctor knows his space travel.
- How can you be sure?

198
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:34,154
He and the girl know
more about space flight than Eldred.

199

- Do not make any mistakes!
- I'm not an expert!

- But you will do it?
- Yes!

204
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:53,743
Commander, I think I should go
as crew on the rocket.

205
00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:57,219
Don't be ridiculous, you're too valuable here!

206
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:59,752
How can T-Mat be repaired if I'm not there?

207
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:03,519
- What about (one of) the technicians (who was already over) there?
- Osgood's dead.

208
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:09,195
- Yes, well, what about Fewsham?
- He's incapable of doing it! I think I) should go!

No! You're the only one
who really understands T-Mat.

Don't worry, (Miss Kelly) we'll be perfectly all right!

But I don't see what good
just this emergency link can be.

Even if you had a gigantic army of warriors,

215
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:32,017
you couldn't send them all to conquer Earth.

- Where are the others?

Locke tried to stop him.

- Sensible.

- Mars is a dying planet.

- Why the moon?

- I think it's just a stepping stone.
- What did you say? They're...Ice Warriors?

Yes, you know, Mars is a cold planet
and they've adapted to that.

- Yeah, They're still in the rocket.

- How many Ice Warriors are there?
- Those creatures you mean?

- Not many, but they're deadly.
- They have their weak points.

- We shall have to destroy T-Mat.

00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:22,196
You better hurry. Those Ice Warriors will be back any minute.

507
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:29,360
Do you know, I find T-Mat travel
rather disappointing.

508
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:31,477
There's no sensation at all!

509
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:34,031
Where have you been? And what were you being up to all this time?

510
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:36,792
Where's... Miss Kelly! What's happening up there?

511
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:39,337
Will someone tell me
what's happening down here?!

512
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:41,615
Who are these people? Is T-Mat working?

513
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:45,572
Now, please, don't... Let us just one question at a time!

514
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:48,075
Doctor, do you know there's been an alien here?

515
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:51,213
- An Ice Warrior HERE?!
- Jamie, I am not surprised.

516
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:53,372
They have taken over the whole Moonbase.

517
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:56,613
- What about the crew?
- All dead except Fewsham.

518
00:37:56,781 --> 00:38:00,251
- You left him there?
- He said he'd follow using the time switch.

519
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:03,140
He should be back.

520
00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:07,532
What's happening?

521
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:09,834
I thought so!
The time switch is still out of order.

522
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:13,590
- What? But he said he had repaired it.
- He was lying.

523
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:16,316
- Why?
- Obviously he's working for them!

524
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:19,472
Then why did he let us escape?

525
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:28,511
(HISSING, LABOURED BREATHING)

526
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,440
(HISSING, LABOURED BREATHING)

527
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:12,173
But don't you see, gentlmen? 
The invasion of Moonbase,
the taking over of T-Mat, 

528
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:16,050
the seed pods, the arrival of the Ice Warrior,
they're all part of the same plan.

529
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,700
Plan? What plan?

530
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:21,631
These incidents seem unrelated.
This fungus everywhere,
what's that got to do with it?

531
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:24,454
I'm not quite sure yet. Have you people been able to make anything of it?

532
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:28,734
It's indestructible.
We've attacked it with every possible way, but without success.

533
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:31,495
Yes, but have you tried to understand it?

534
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,334
You suggest we should psychoanalyse it, Doctor?

535
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:38,779
I'm merely suggesting that rather than destroy it, you should
find out its composition and purpose.

536
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:41,751
I have some laboratory equipment
in my workshop. You could use that.

537
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:44,614
- Good. Then we need a sample.
- No problem about that.

538
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:47,275
- The gardens are full of the stuff.
- Fine. The let no time to be lost.

539
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:48,965
I'll get some equipment for you.

540
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:52,850
Doctor, do be careful. Those pod things are deadly.

541
00:39:52,921 --> 00:39:56,038
Don't worry. I've already had experience. I'll be careful.

542
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:02,657
(DOCTOR) Yes... It's organic.

543
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:04,812
It's alive.

544
00:40:04,981 --> 00:40:07,814
It's definitely a fungus composition.

545
00:40:07,981 --> 00:40:11,615
- Are you sure this is correct?
- As far as I can make out, it is.

546
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:15,276
A molecule of five atoms...absorbs oxygen.

547
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:18,438
You know,  a complete blanket of this

548
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:23,199
would reduce the oxygen content
of the Earth's atmosphere drastically.

549
00:40:23,261 --> 00:40:26,936
According to my calculations,
to one twentieth normal.

550
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:30,299
It would make the Earth's atmosphere
uninhabitable to the human race,

551
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,680
but exactly like the atmosphere of Mars!

552
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:39,752
Look at that. Even without vegetation
to feed on, it's still active. Oh!

553
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:42,879
(ELDRED) If that thing explodes here, the fumes will kill us! Come on, Doctor!

554
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,714
Just a minute. There must be some way of...

555
00:40:51,441 --> 00:40:54,831
(ELDRED) Come on!
(DOCTOR) Sulphuric acid!

556
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,356
Hydrochloric acid!

557
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:01,312
Acetic acid!

558
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:13,192
(ELDRED) You've done it!

559
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:16,034
Well, what was it? What did you throw on it?

560
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:21,451
- You really think it would work?
- Well It could be less effective than Moonbase, of course.

561
00:41:21,621 --> 00:41:24,419
which handles up to two million microwave channels simultaneously,

562
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:26,675
the satellite would just take a few thousand.

563
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:28,791
That would be enough for vital food supplies.

564
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:32,410
But we can't use normal communications satellites.
They are not programmed for T-Mat.

565
00:41:32,581 --> 00:41:34,474
No. We have to send up a specially       programmed one.

566
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,151
That would mean using a rocket, wouldn't it? I thought no one use them nowadays.

567
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:40,814
Not manned rockets, but we do send up satellites for communications.

568
00:41:40,981 --> 00:41:44,796
- How soon can you get one up?
- Well, I don't know. If we're given top priority...

572
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:04,650
A communications unit from our ship.

573

Connect it to the solar batteries!

00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:13,033
<i>(DOCTOR) Is Commander Radnor there, please?</i>

575
00:42:13,201 --> 00:42:17,972
<i>- Oh, Zoe, is Radnor there?</i>
- He's in conference with Miss Kelly and Sir James Gregson.

576
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:21,358
<i>Oh, I see. Zoe,</i>
<i>there's the most wonderful news!</i>

577
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:23,974
<i>We've found a way of destroying the fungus!</i>

00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,909
- Oh! What is it?
<i>- Water! Ordinary water!</i>

579
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:29,834
- Oh, Doctor, surely...
<i>- There's no time to explain now.</i>

580
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:33,398
<i>Apparently, there is a Weather Control Bureau somewhere.</i>

581
00:42:33,561 --> 00:42:35,392
<i>I want you to get in touch with them.</i>

582
00:42:35,561 --> 00:42:37,975
Can't you reach them on the video phone?

583
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:40,917
<i>- No, I've tried. They are not answering, or it's broken down or something.</i>

584
00:42:41,081 --> 00:42:43,952
- What do you want me to do?
- <i>Get hold of the Weather Control Bureau people</i>

585
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:47,655
<i>and to make rain, as much rain as possible</i>
<i>over the entire country!</i>

- I don't know.

Let's find the main control room. Come on.

588
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:07,238
So that's why no one answered
the video phone.

589
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:09,392
And look at that!

590
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:14,614
No, it's no good. They're locked in position.

<i>- But it's operating on Moonbase power.</i>

<i>Very well. Test it!</i>

601
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:59,032
Commander Radnor, can this be recorded?

602
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:01,192
- Yes.
- Quickly! Manage it. It's vital!

603
00:44:01,361 --> 00:44:04,194

I realise the importance of that.
If we overshoot the moon,

nothing will stop them from going
straight into an orbit around the sun.

They will not overshoot!

615
00:44:38,921 --> 00:44:43,312
Of course not, but since their fuel
supplies are at a marginal level,

616
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:47,918
if anything did go wrong,
they'd never be able to regain moon orbit.

You'll never get that thing going again!

Doctor, I know we're sending up a false signal,

656
00:47:49,178 --> 00:47:52,250
but aren't some of the Martian ships bound to follow the right one?

657
00:47:52,418 --> 00:47:55,476
There isn't going to be a right one, there's going to be only ours, the wrong one,

658
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:59,277
and that's going to lead the entire Martian fleet
into an orbit round the sun!

659
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:02,228
- What about Slaar's signal?
- Obviously that has to be stopped.

660
00:48:02,348 --> 00:48:04,308
- But how?
- Well, as soon as that satellite is up

661
00:48:04,398 --> 00:48:07,747
I shall T-Mat myself to the moon
and destroy their homing device.

662
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:09,870
- They'll kill you on sight!
- No, I don't think so.

01:03:35,547 --> 01:03:38,619
So it is! Have you
a T-Mat cubicle ready for me?

833
01:03:38,787 --> 01:03:41,699
- Yes, Number 6.
- See you later.

834
01:03:46,667 --> 01:03:50,740
Prepare lunar cubicle Number 6
for transport to Moon Control.

835
01:03:50,907 --> 01:03:52,704
Ready and waiting.

836
01:03:52,867 --> 01:03:54,266
Activate.

837
01:03:56,907 --> 01:04:00,058
(TRILLING TONE)

838
01:04:05,787 --> 01:04:08,620
It's lucky he got here
before your man arrived.

839
01:04:08,787 --> 01:04:10,186
Yes. He's late.

840
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,781
- Keep a T-Mat cubicle open.
- Right.

841
01:04:14,107 --> 01:04:16,541
Local cubicle two holding open.

842
01:04:16,707 --> 01:04:20,495
- Report Moonbase situation.
<i>- Moonbase clear.</i>

844
01:04:24,187 --> 01:04:26,701
<i>Local arrival. Cubicle two activating.</i>

(TRILLING TONE)

846
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:42,865
Good morning, Brent.
Good morning, Gia. All functioning well?

847
01:04:43,027 --> 01:04:45,018
Of course, Commander Radnor.

848
01:04:45,187 --> 01:04:48,418
In your case, efficiency and charm
go hand in hand!

849
01:04:48,587 --> 01:04:52,944
- I try to run things smoothly.
- Nothing goes wrong while you're on duty!

850
01:04:53,107 --> 01:04:54,665
I don't allow it!

851
01:06:35,947 --> 01:06:38,222
I thought the system was infallible.

852
01:06:38,387 --> 01:06:41,857
- It won't be anything serious.
- I'm glad you think so!

853
01:06:42,027 --> 01:06:46,578
- Brent, is there any obvious damage?
- None reported. All links stable.

854
01:06:46,747 --> 01:06:50,342
- That's only local.
- It's part of the checking process.

855
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:54,182
- Report on T-Mat breakdown.
<i>- Complete power phase blank.</i>

856
01:06:54,347 --> 01:06:58,818
- The materialisation pulse generator?
<i>- Overloaded. No damage this end.</i>

857
01:06:58,987 --> 01:07:01,979
- Check with Moonbase.
<i>- Primary video link dead.</i>

858
01:07:02,147 --> 01:07:04,138
- Cause?
<i>- Being investigated.</i>

859
01:07:04,307 --> 01:07:08,858
- Are you sure it isn't serious?
- My staff are running a thorough check.

860
01:07:09,027 --> 01:07:13,066
- Until I have the report, I can't answer.
- I want that report soon!

(WHOOSHING)

862
01:07:23,307 --> 01:07:25,901
Doctor, if we've landed, where are we?

863
01:07:26,067 --> 01:07:28,661
That is what I'm trying to find out, Zoe.

864
01:07:30,427 --> 01:07:34,056
(ZOE) A rocket?
(JAMIE) We're just hanging in space!

865
01:07:34,227 --> 01:07:36,024
Well, we can't be!

866
01:07:36,187 --> 01:07:38,576
Let's try and find a star we know.

867
01:07:39,667 --> 01:07:43,137
(DOCTOR GROANS WITH EFFORT)
There we are.

868
01:07:44,587 --> 01:07:46,384
What in heaven's name...?

869
01:07:46,547 --> 01:07:49,778
- What's he up to?
- He's trying to climb aboard.

870
01:07:49,947 --> 01:07:52,859
Just a minute... Just a minute.

871
01:07:54,227 --> 01:07:56,297
(DOCTOR) Oh, this control is...

872
01:07:56,467 --> 01:07:58,697
There we are.

873
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:04,100
Now that's an ion-jet rocket
of the 21st century, but...but...

874
01:08:04,267 --> 01:08:06,258
..this helmet, if I can...

875
01:08:06,427 --> 01:08:07,940
There we are!

876
01:08:08,107 --> 01:08:13,227
That's not nearly so sophisticated.
It's certainly not later than 1960.

877
01:08:13,387 --> 01:08:15,537
(JAMIE) The letters on his helmet?

878
01:08:15,707 --> 01:08:18,505
(ZOE) C-C-C-P.

879
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:20,658
(DOCTOR) Of course!

880
01:08:20,827 --> 01:08:22,704
- What?
- Just a minute.

881
01:08:24,707 --> 01:08:27,824
(DOCTOR) Yes, I think that explains it!

882
01:08:27,987 --> 01:08:29,978
(ZOE) Well, Doctor, what is it?

883
01:08:30,147 --> 01:08:32,217
(DOCTOR) It's a flying machine,

884
01:08:32,387 --> 01:08:36,938
designed by a gentleman by the name
of Leonardo da Vinci in about 1500.

885
01:08:37,107 --> 01:08:40,656
- Well, what's it doing up here?!
- Doctor, where are we?

886
01:08:40,827 --> 01:08:42,818
- We're in a museum!
- A what?

887
01:08:42,987 --> 01:08:46,821
A space museum! Look!
There you are. A balloon...

888
01:08:48,307 --> 01:08:52,459
That's a transport plane.
Now, those initials stand for Russia.

889
01:08:52,627 --> 01:08:57,018
That's Gagarin,
the first earthman in space. Look.

890
01:08:58,587 --> 01:09:01,579
Come on, let's have a look round, shall we?

891
01:09:06,307 --> 01:09:07,706
Wait for me!

892
01:14:48,107 --> 01:14:50,462
You will start work at once!

893
01:14:50,627 --> 01:14:52,697
There will be a guard at the door.

894
01:14:52,867 --> 01:14:56,337
When I return...

895
01:14:56,507 --> 01:15:02,104
..you will have the T-Mat link
ready for operation.

896
01:15:02,267 --> 01:15:05,703
(HISSING, LABOURED BREATHING)

897
01:15:06,867 --> 01:15:10,542
Don't be a fool, Fewsham!
If we repair the emergency link,

898
01:15:10,707 --> 01:15:13,096
these creatures can travel to Earth!

899
01:15:13,267 --> 01:15:16,339
- What about us?
- As soon as he gets what he wants,

900
01:15:16,507 --> 01:15:18,498
we'll mean nothing to him!

901
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:22,660
- If we co-operate, we've got a chance!
- Osgood didn't take it!

902
01:15:22,827 --> 01:15:26,422
Do you think I want to die
like that? I want to live!

903
01:15:35,787 --> 01:15:38,824
(KELLY) Brent, is there
any trace of a reason?

904
01:15:38,987 --> 01:15:42,662
We've double checked.
This end is functioning normally.

905
01:15:42,827 --> 01:15:44,545
Then it must be Moonbase!

906
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:48,256
We've no way of checking
their apparatus from this end.

907
01:15:48,427 --> 01:15:52,181
- Commander Radnor's at a meeting.
- He'll expect a full report.

908
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:55,066
There it is.
We've even checked the computer.

909
01:15:55,227 --> 01:15:58,697
(RADNOR) Have you located
the cause of the breakdown?

910
01:15:58,867 --> 01:16:02,098
- This end is clear.
- That isn't what I want to know!

911
01:16:02,267 --> 01:16:04,861
- We cannot trace the fault.
- Miss Kelly!

912
01:16:08,507 --> 01:16:11,704
I have senior government officials
hounding me.

913
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:16,657
They expect a more informative
answer, and so do I!

914
01:16:16,827 --> 01:16:19,660
There isn't one. The trouble is at Moonbase.

915
01:16:19,827 --> 01:16:22,899
- Why can't you deal with it?
- We can't get there.

916
01:16:23,067 --> 01:16:25,058
We can't even talk to them.

917
01:16:25,227 --> 01:16:28,378
You mean there's no other way
of contacting them?

918
01:16:28,547 --> 01:16:30,378
Only by rocket (!)

919
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:35,259
That could be our only answer!

920
01:16:35,427 --> 01:16:38,942
(BRENT) The only place you'll find
a rocket is in a museum!

921
01:16:39,107 --> 01:16:42,338
- Exactly!
- Even if one could be made operational,

922
01:16:42,507 --> 01:16:47,706
- no one could control such a project.
- You're wrong. There is one man,

923
01:16:47,867 --> 01:16:49,983
one man alone who can help us now.

924
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:54,345
For the last time, who are you
and why are you in my private workshop?

925
01:16:54,507 --> 01:16:59,786
Now there really is no need
for all these...these histrionics.

926
01:16:59,947 --> 01:17:03,656
- We are perfectly harmless!
- How did you even get in here?

927
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:06,387
The usual way. We just materialised.

928
01:17:06,547 --> 01:17:10,540
The T-Mat cubicle didn't give
automatic warnings this time.

929
01:17:10,707 --> 01:17:12,823
(ZOE) That's not our fault, is it?

930
01:17:12,987 --> 01:17:15,865
- Why did you come?
- Well, this is a museum!

931
01:17:16,027 --> 01:17:18,780
The museum is... What on earth's that?

932
01:17:18,947 --> 01:17:22,178
It's a 20th-century police box, isn't it?

933
01:17:22,347 --> 01:17:24,338
Well, yes, in a way.

934
01:17:24,507 --> 01:17:26,577
Well, how did it get in my museum?

935
01:17:26,747 --> 01:17:29,659
(ZOE) You could say
it was a form of spaceship.

936
01:17:29,827 --> 01:17:32,057
We owe this gentleman an apology.

937
01:17:32,227 --> 01:17:35,776
We really are most interested
in the museum, Mr, um...?

938
01:17:35,947 --> 01:17:37,938
Eldred. Professor Eldred.

939
01:17:38,107 --> 01:17:42,305
The museum is closed
to the general public. Please leave.

940
01:17:42,467 --> 01:17:46,142
- Are you in charge of this place?
- I own it! I have the right

941
01:17:46,307 --> 01:17:49,697
- to ask you to leave!
- There's no need to threaten us.

942
01:17:49,867 --> 01:17:53,542
- Trespassers are not welcome!
- We're not trespassers!

943
01:17:53,707 --> 01:17:58,303
- We're very interested!
- Interested in these antiquated machines?

944
01:17:56,194 --> 01:18:00,392
(ZOE) It's no use. No contact
at all. Every circuit's dead.

945
01:17:58,467 --> 01:18:01,937
Come for a good laugh, I suppose,
like the rest of them!

946
01:18:00,554 --> 01:18:04,866
- This is most unfortunate!
- Don't try them again. You'll blow us up!

947
01:18:02,107 --> 01:18:07,465
Laugh?! You mean people laugh at this?
It's a magnificent exhibition!

948
01:18:05,034 --> 01:18:06,433
We don't need a radio.

949
01:18:06,594 --> 01:18:09,904
- We're nearly there.
- I wanted to contact Earth.

950
01:18:07,627 --> 01:18:11,097
- We've had enough souvenir hunters!
- We're not thieves!

951
01:18:10,074 --> 01:18:13,464
There's no need. We can activate
the moon homing beam.

952
01:18:11,267 --> 01:18:13,622
We haven't come to take anything!

953
01:18:13,634 --> 01:18:16,990
How? We've got no contact
with anyone on the moon.

954
01:18:13,787 --> 01:18:16,745
We genuinely are interested in space travel!

955
01:18:16,907 --> 01:18:19,057
Why, especially a thing like this!

956
01:18:17,154 --> 01:18:20,066
It's quite simple. It's an automatic device.

957
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:22,025
- This is superb!
- (ELDRED) Yes, magnificent!

958
01:18:20,234 --> 01:18:24,147
Our code radio signals
trigger the homing beam into action.

959
01:18:22,187 --> 01:18:25,862
It was to have been the vehicle
to take man beyond the moon.

960
01:18:24,314 --> 01:18:26,305
We automatically lock onto it

961
01:18:26,027 --> 01:18:30,498
- T-Mat put an end to all that!
- You mean this model's been abandoned?

962
01:18:26,474 --> 01:18:30,592
until we reach the point in orbit
where we fire retro-rockets to land.

963
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:35,343
But its speed and stability are
a tremendous advance in rocket design!

964
01:18:30,754 --> 01:18:33,985
If they've all been cut off,
how can they activate?

965
01:18:34,154 --> 01:18:37,464
It works off a different
power source - solar power.

966
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:37,975
Exactly! Here, let me show it to you!

967
01:18:37,634 --> 01:18:40,023
It's independent of the T-Mat system.

968
01:18:40,194 --> 01:18:41,673
I just hope it works.

969
01:18:40,907 --> 01:18:43,580
Oh, yes, this is superb. My word!

970
01:18:41,834 --> 01:18:45,907
If it doesn't, we'll have trouble docking.
It could be quite a crash.

971
01:18:43,747 --> 01:18:48,104
The real breakthrough was a compact
generator of enormous power!

972
01:18:46,074 --> 01:18:48,349
Let's try. I think we're near enough.

973
01:18:48,267 --> 01:18:51,896
And these must be the secondary
electrode accelerators.

974
01:18:49,514 --> 01:18:53,268
- (THREE-TONE SIGNAL)
- That's our activating signal.

975
01:18:52,067 --> 01:18:56,902
Yes, you see, it beat the problem
of the neutral caesium ions.

976
01:18:54,274 --> 01:18:57,072
- (STEADY BEEP)
- As long as that note is steady,

977
01:18:57,067 --> 01:19:00,662
It magnified the G-thrust, too.
Fantastic proportions!

978
01:18:57,234 --> 01:18:59,270
we're home and dry, no trouble!

979
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:02,028
Hello, Earth Control, this is Moonbase.

980
01:19:00,827 --> 01:19:02,624
That was awkward!

981
01:19:02,194 --> 01:19:05,903
Emergency! Emergency! Can you hear me?

982
01:19:02,787 --> 01:19:05,540
- What did you do about that?
- I'll show you.

983
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,698
(DOCTOR) What have we got here?

984
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:08,668
Hello, Earth Control, this is Moonbase.

985
01:19:07,867 --> 01:19:10,620
Look at them! They're like a couple of kids!

986
01:19:08,834 --> 01:19:11,109
Emergency! Can you hear me?

987
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:13,585
Yeah, he's almost in love with that rocket!

988
01:19:11,274 --> 01:19:17,144
Hello, Earth Control. This is Moonbase.
Emergency! Can you hear me?

989
01:19:13,747 --> 01:19:16,580
Well, that's not surprising - I designed it!

990
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:18,897
I've been in rocketry all my life.

991
01:19:18,114 --> 01:19:21,345
Hello, Earth Control. This is Moonbase.

992
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:22,662
My father engineered
the first lunar passenger module,

993
01:19:21,514 --> 01:19:24,984
Can you hear me? Hello, Earth Control...

- Space travel.

why did you stop at the moon?

- Because of T-Mat.

T-Mat, the ultimate in travel,

1000
01:19:38,467 --> 01:19:42,904
with as much sense of adventure
as a synthetic carbohydrates factory!

1001
01:19:43,067 --> 01:19:47,538
Surely rockets would still be useful
as an auxiliary means of transport?

1002
01:19:47,707 --> 01:19:50,460
Besides, how would man get beyond the moon?

1003

02:00:58,514 --> 02:01:01,745
- Find some other way!
- Your rocket is our only hope

1168
02:01:01,914 --> 02:01:03,393
of reaching the moon.

1169
02:01:03,554 --> 02:01:05,704
- Listen to them.
- I'm listening!

1170
02:01:05,874 --> 02:01:08,468
In a way, this is a triumph for your rocket!

1171
02:01:08,634 --> 02:01:11,865
- Is it?
- Yes! The government recognises the fact.

1172
02:01:12,034 --> 02:01:15,185
Then the government is going to be disappointed!

1173
02:01:18,394 --> 02:01:20,385
I don't understand you!

1174
02:01:20,554 --> 02:01:24,547
I'll be frank. I played with the idea
of making a space flight,

1175
02:01:24,714 --> 02:01:29,424
I even prepared a rocket,
but it was just a dream -

1176
02:01:29,594 --> 02:01:31,789
an illusion for a disappointed man.

1177
02:01:31,954 --> 02:01:35,629
- So there's nothing?
- The rocket's partially prepared.

1178
02:01:35,794 --> 02:01:38,547
- As for an actual lift-off...
- We can do it!

1179
02:01:38,714 --> 02:01:42,548
It takes more than enthusiasm
to get a rocket off the ground!

1180
02:01:42,714 --> 02:01:47,663
- We have funds, men, equipment...
- What it needs, you haven't got - time!

1181
02:01:47,834 --> 02:01:52,032
- We have the best technicians.
- It's nowhere near ready, woman!

1182
02:01:52,194 --> 02:01:54,389
The equipment is still unchecked!

1183
02:01:54,554 --> 02:01:58,024
- A computer can do that.
- It would still be dangerous!

1184
02:02:01,234 --> 02:02:03,225
Daniel...

1185
02:02:04,394 --> 02:02:06,624
It was you who created this rocket.

1186
02:02:07,794 --> 02:02:12,709
It was your driving force and enthusiasm
that got it off the drawing board.

1187
02:02:12,874 --> 02:02:16,389
With you in control, we can't fail to succeed!

1188
02:02:16,554 --> 02:02:19,307
That was a long time past.

1189
02:02:19,474 --> 02:02:22,864
Now my heart couldn't take
the strain of the G-force.

1190
02:02:23,034 --> 02:02:26,310
But your experience and knowledge
aren't useless.

1191
02:02:26,474 --> 02:02:28,590
- We need your guidance.
- No!

1192
02:02:35,474 --> 02:02:37,829
I told you it's a dream!

1193
02:02:38,474 --> 02:02:42,387
I can never go to the moon
and neither can rocket ZA 685!

1194
02:05:06,994 --> 02:05:08,791
- Doctor...
- Yes?

1195
02:05:08,954 --> 02:05:12,549
- Are you all planning to crew the rocket?
- Oh, aye!

1196
02:05:12,714 --> 02:05:16,343
- I hadn't thought about you.
- You're not leaving me behind!

1197
02:05:16,514 --> 02:05:20,302
- There can be no excess weight.
- How many does this thing hold?

1198
02:05:20,474 --> 02:05:23,910
- It was designed for three men.
- Well, then, I'm going!

1199
02:05:24,074 --> 02:05:28,306
The fuel stocks are barely adequate
for a moon journey and return.

1200
02:05:28,474 --> 02:05:31,511
- What about other sources?
- New York and Moscow.

1201
02:05:31,674 --> 02:05:35,110
- Transit impossible.
- We're only getting TO the moon.

1202
02:05:35,274 --> 02:05:37,742
We'll come back by T-Mat, won't we?

1203
02:05:37,914 --> 02:05:39,905
It depends what's wrong with it.

1204
02:05:40,074 --> 02:05:44,545
The moon has a fuel dump
and a refuelling system on the landing bay.

1205
02:05:44,714 --> 02:05:47,023
But that hasn't been used for years!

1206
02:05:47,194 --> 02:05:51,233
Neither has the radio homing beam.
Without it, you won't land at all!

1207
02:05:51,394 --> 02:05:54,147
In that case, why worry about getting back (?)

1208
02:05:54,314 --> 02:05:57,704
The equipment's fully automated
and solar-powered.

1209
02:05:57,874 --> 02:06:00,991
- No reason why it shouldn't work.
- I'm sure it will.

1210
02:06:01,154 --> 02:06:05,545
- Will you remember all I told you?
- Even if I don't, Zoe has total recall.

1211
02:06:05,714 --> 02:06:08,911
- Well, I've written it all down.
- There's no need.

1212
02:06:09,074 --> 02:06:11,304
And there's a map of Moonbase, too.

1213
02:06:13,874 --> 02:06:16,468
You know how to operate the homing beam?

1214
02:06:16,634 --> 02:06:19,626
Don't worry. Your rocket will be in good hands.

1215
02:06:19,794 --> 02:06:21,273
(JAMIE) A-hem!

1216
02:06:21,434 --> 02:06:24,073
You've only food and water for three days.

02:09:02,294 --> 02:09:07,049
Preset registering normal functions.
Lift-off activation check complete.

1224
02:09:08,974 --> 02:09:11,124
All readings alpha green.

1225
02:09:11,294 --> 02:09:15,128
- Well done! Record time and not a thing wrong!
- So far!

1226
02:09:33,834 --> 02:09:36,871
Link programme to telemeter guidance.

1227
02:09:37,674 --> 02:09:39,153
Three minutes.

1228
02:09:39,314 --> 02:09:42,465
Countdown will begin at T minus 60 seconds.

1229
02:09:42,634 --> 02:09:44,625
(RADNOR) This is it.

1230
02:09:44,794 --> 02:09:48,787
(KELLY) All functions
are now on computer control preset.

1231
02:09:48,954 --> 02:09:51,343
Clear launching site.

1232
02:09:53,594 --> 02:09:55,983
Three minutes seem a long time.

1233
02:09:56,154 --> 02:09:59,544
Yes. You remember
your take-off briefing, Jamie?

1234
02:09:59,714 --> 02:10:02,911
Aye, he's told me
about this G-force stuff. I know!

1235
02:10:03,074 --> 02:10:06,464
You don't know about it
until you've experienced it!

1236
02:10:06,634 --> 02:10:09,228
<i>(KELLY) Tminus 60 seconds from now.</i>

1237
02:10:09,394 --> 02:10:12,147
One minute to go. Hold tight, everyone!

1238
02:10:12,314 --> 02:10:14,987
Well, I'm all right. How about you, Jamie?

1239
02:10:15,154 --> 02:10:17,145
I keep telling you - I'm fine!

1240
02:10:17,314 --> 02:10:18,747
<i>(KELLY) Tminus 50.</i>

1241
02:10:18,914 --> 02:10:21,428
Ensure telemeter guidance is operative!

1242
02:10:21,594 --> 02:10:24,984
Don't worry! Everything's
been checked and rechecked!

1243
02:10:26,154 --> 02:10:29,783
- T minus 40. Technicians, report.
- (BRENT) All areas clear.

1244
02:10:29,954 --> 02:10:31,706
Check all systems.

1245
02:10:31,874 --> 02:10:33,865
- We have.
- We must make sure!

1246
02:10:34,034 --> 02:10:37,504
T minus...30.

1247
02:10:40,794 --> 02:10:42,785
<i>(KELLY) 26...</i>

1248
02:10:44,674 --> 02:10:46,665

<i>14...</i>

1251
02:13:34,994 --> 02:13:36,791
We have lift-off!

1252
02:13:41,474 --> 02:13:45,990
(RADNOR) I never thought I'd see
that again - a rocket rising in flight!

1253
02:13:46,154 --> 02:13:48,145
Beautiful!

1254
02:13:48,314 --> 02:13:50,384
Let's see how they are.

1255
02:13:51,874 --> 02:13:53,466
The link is dead!

1256
02:13:54,474 --> 02:13:58,433
Something must have gone wrong
on lift-off! Try the second channel.

1257
02:13:59,394 --> 02:14:02,750
- Nothing.
- We're out of touch completely?!

1258
02:14:09,314 --> 02:14:11,305
What about radio link?

1259
02:14:12,394 --> 02:14:16,467
Earth Control to rocket.
How do you read me? Over.

1260
02:14:16,634 --> 02:14:19,228
No, nothing but static!

1261
02:14:19,394 --> 02:14:21,544
It's only a minor fault, surely?

1262
02:14:22,874 --> 02:14:26,184
<i>(KELLY) Earth Control to rocket.</i>
<i>How do you read me?</i>

1263
02:14:26,354 --> 02:14:30,347
Don't release the strap until
we have automatic gravity control,

1264
02:14:30,514 --> 02:14:32,584
otherwise you'll float away.

1265
02:14:32,754 --> 02:14:35,222
<i>- (KELLY) Earth Control to rocket!</i>
- Wait!

1266
02:14:35,394 --> 02:14:38,227
Switching to automatic gravity control now!

1267
02:14:38,394 --> 02:14:39,952
Try again.

1268
02:14:40,114 --> 02:14:42,105
Earth Control to rocket.

1269
02:14:42,274 --> 02:14:45,983
<i>(ZOE) Rocket to Earth Control.</i>
<i>Wait a minute, can't you?</i>

1270
02:14:46,154 --> 02:14:49,988
Is everything all right?
We've lost our video monitor link.

1271
02:14:50,154 --> 02:14:54,784
<i>(DOCTOR) Yes, I think there must be</i>
<i>a fault in one of the circuits.</i>

1272
02:14:56,154 --> 02:14:58,145
Doctor? Doctor!

1273
02:14:58,994 --> 02:15:01,588
- (ZOE) What is it?
- A circuit's burnt out.

1274
02:15:01,754 --> 02:15:05,508
- I'll switch to another one.
- This is worse than the Tardis!

1275
02:15:05,674 --> 02:15:08,268
Do you read me, Doctor?!

1276
02:15:08,434 --> 02:15:13,144
It sounds as though the entire
communications circuitry has blown out!

1277
02:15:13,314 --> 02:15:16,306
Yes. Let's hope that's all that's happened!

1278
02:15:16,474 --> 02:15:18,385
Keep trying, Miss Kelly.
