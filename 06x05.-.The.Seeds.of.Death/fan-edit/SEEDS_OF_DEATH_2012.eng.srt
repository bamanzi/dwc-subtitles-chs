- Morning. Just as well you've arrived!

01:03:05,627 --> 01:03:09,506
The sooner you take over from Fewsham on Moon Control the better!

All T-Mat consignments
are five minutes behind schedule.

176
01:03:13,307 --> 01:03:17,095
Fewsham routed a Moscow consignment
through to Canberra.

177
01:03:17,267 --> 01:03:20,737
- He's a lunatic!
- You shouldn't have recommended him

178
01:03:20,907 --> 01:03:23,216
for an assistant controller's job.

179
01:03:23,387 --> 01:03:26,459
Yes, I know now,
but I thought he deserved a break.

180
01:03:26,627 --> 01:03:31,018
He'll do something disastrous one day
and you'll have to answer for it!

181
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:35,385
- So, I'll work in a synthetics factory!
- It's your career!

182
01:03:35,547 --> 01:03:38,619
So it is! Have you
a T-Mat cubicle ready for me?

183
01:03:38,787 --> 01:03:41,699
- Yes, Number 6.
- See you later.

It's lucky he got here

Yes. He's late.

Good morning, Brent.
Good morning, Gia. All functioning well?

Of course, Commander Radnor.

198
01:04:45,187 --> 01:04:48,418
In your case, efficiency and charm
go hand in hand!

- Brent, is there any obvious damage?
- None reported. All links stable.

Then it must be Moonbase!

We've no way of checking
their apparatus from this end.

- He'll expect a full report.

There it is.
We've even checked the computer.

the cause of the breakdown?

hounding me.

They expect a more informative
answer, and so do I!

01:16:16,827 --> 01:16:19,660
There isn't one. The trouble is at Moonbase.

- We can't get there.

266

We can't even talk to them.

267
01:16:25,227 --> 01:16:28,378
You mean there's no other way
of contacting them?

268
01:16:28,547 --> 01:16:30,378
Only by rocket (!)

269
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:35,259

- Exactly!
- Even if one could be made operational,

272

- How did you even get in here?

277
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:06,387
The usual way. We just materialised.

278
01:17:06,547 --> 01:17:10,540
The T-Mat cubicle didn't give
automatic warnings this time.

279

- Why did you come?
- Well, this is a museum!

281

The museum is... What on earth's that?

01:17:18,947 --> 01:17:22,178
It's a 20th-century police box, isn't it?

Well, yes, in a way.

284
01:17:24,507 --> 01:17:26,577
Well, how did it get in my museum?

285
01:17:26,747 --> 01:17:29,659
(ZOE) You could say
it was a form of spaceship.

We owe this gentleman an apology.

01:17:32,227 --> 01:17:35,776
We really are most interested
in the museum, Mr, um...?

Eldred. Professor Eldred.

289
01:17:38,107 --> 01:17:42,305
The museum is closed
to the general public. Please leave.

01:17:42,467 --> 01:17:46,142
- Are you in charge of this place?
- I own it! I have the right

291
01:17:46,307 --> 01:17:49,697
- to ask you to leave!
- There's no need to threaten us.

292
01:17:49,867 --> 01:17:53,542
- Trespassers are not welcome!
- We're not trespassers!

293

- Interested in these antiquated machines?

294

Come for a good laugh, I suppose,
like the rest of them!

295
01:18:02,107 --> 01:18:07,465
Laugh?! You mean people laugh at this?
It's a magnificent exhibition!

- We've had enough souvenir hunters!
- We're not thieves!

297

We haven't come to take anything!

298
01:18:13,787 --> 01:18:16,745
We genuinely are interested in space travel!

299
01:18:16,907 --> 01:18:19,057
Why, especially a thing like this!

300
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:22,025
- This is superb!
- (ELDRED) Yes, magnificent!

301
01:18:22,187 --> 01:18:25,862
It was to have been the vehicle
to take man beyond the moon.

302
01:18:26,027 --> 01:18:30,498
- T-Mat put an end to all that!
- You mean this model's been abandoned?

303
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:35,343
But its speed and stability are
a tremendous advance in rocket design!

304
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:37,975
Exactly! Here, let me show it to you!

305
01:18:40,907 --> 01:18:43,580
Oh, yes, this is superb. My word!

306
01:18:43,747 --> 01:18:48,104
The real breakthrough was a compact
generator of enormous power!

307
01:18:48,267 --> 01:18:51,896
And these must be the secondary
electrode accelerators.

308
01:18:52,067 --> 01:18:56,902
Yes, you see, it beat the problem
of the neutral caesium ions.

309
01:18:57,067 --> 01:19:00,662
It magnified the G-thrust, too.
Fantastic proportions!

310
01:19:00,827 --> 01:19:02,624
That was awkward!

311
01:19:02,787 --> 01:19:05,540
- What did you do about that?
- I'll show you.

312
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,698
(DOCTOR) What have we got here?

313
01:19:07,867 --> 01:19:10,620
Look at them! They're like a couple of kids!

314
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:13,585
Yeah, he's almost in love with that rocket!

315
01:19:13,747 --> 01:19:16,580
Well, that's not surprising - I designed it!

316
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:18,897
I've been in rocketry all my life.

317
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:22,662
My father engineered
the first lunar passenger module,

318
01:19:22,827 --> 01:19:26,979
and I travelled on the last trip
back to Earth before it finished.

319
01:19:27,147 --> 01:19:29,707
- Before what finished?
- Space travel.

320
01:19:29,867 --> 01:19:33,462
But if the rocket was so good,
why did you stop at the moon?

321
01:19:33,627 --> 01:19:36,061
- Aye, why end there?
- Because of T-Mat.

322
01:19:36,227 --> 01:19:38,297
T-Mat, the ultimate in travel,

323
01:19:38,467 --> 01:19:42,904
with as much sense of adventure
as a synthetic carbohydrates factory!

324
01:19:43,067 --> 01:19:47,538
Surely rockets would still be useful
as an auxiliary means of transport?

325
01:19:47,707 --> 01:19:50,460
Besides, how would man get beyond the moon?

326
01:19:50,627 --> 01:19:53,539
Nobody cares any more about exploring space.

327
01:19:53,707 --> 01:19:57,859
Life's made... Well, it was
made too easy by T-Mat.

328
01:19:58,027 --> 01:20:00,461
I see. So you lost government backing?

329
01:20:00,627 --> 01:20:03,778
The project was abandoned...except by me.

330
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:12,460
You've got to help me! If we don't
repair it, we'll all be killed!

331
01:20:12,627 --> 01:20:15,699
Maybe we could repair it
and T-Mat back to London?

332
01:20:15,867 --> 01:20:19,542
With that thing guarding the door?
I'll keep on trying.

333
01:20:19,707 --> 01:20:22,380
Maybe there is something we can do.

334
01:20:22,547 --> 01:20:24,617
- What?
- I knew you'd see reason!

335
01:20:28,387 --> 01:20:32,266
- What are you doing?!
- The video link with Earth.

336
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:34,816
It's not so badly damaged as the T-Mat.

337
01:20:34,987 --> 01:20:37,501
We're supposed to repair the T-Mat link!

338
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:40,420
Maybe we can get a message through by video.

339
01:20:40,587 --> 01:20:43,704
A guard will see what we're doing!
He'll kill us!

340

You play your game, we'll play ours.

341
00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:34,096
Stop him!

342
00:09:37,424 --> 00:09:41,019
(RASPING WHISPER)
Hunt that man! He must not escape!

343
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:43,977
Can we not help them? We can use the Tardis!

344
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:48,196
To go to the moon? We'd probably
overshoot by a few million years!

345
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:50,355
Yes, or by a few million miles!

346
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:53,596
The Tardis is not suited to short-range travel.

347
00:09:53,764 --> 00:09:55,573
Still, we should help them if we can.

348
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,133
- Aye.
- Yes.

349
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:05,243
- I could get your rocket to the moon.
- You?

350
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:09,399
Yes, I have considerable experience
in space travel.

351
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:10,855
That's splendid! Thank you!

352
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:15,717
- But the rocket is not ready!
- Perhaps you overestimate the difficulty.

353
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:18,657
How much more work is required?

354
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:21,896
It needs fuel
and a complete computerised check.

355
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:25,181
- I can order that.
- No! The risk is too great!

356
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:26,335
If there was some other way,

357
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:29,302
- I wouldn't even consider such a risk!
- No!

- Yes, Miss Kelly?

384
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,556
Is it wise letting these people crew the rocket?

385

What's the alternative?
We gave up training astronauts years ago.

- Who are they?
- Eldred's crazy friends, I imagine,

00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:30,518
- but the Doctor knows his space travel.
- How can you be sure?

388
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:34,154
He and the girl know
more about space flight than Eldred.

- Do not make any mistakes!
- I'm not an expert!

393

- But you will do it?
- Yes!

394
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:53,743
Commander, I think I should go
as crew on the rocket.

395
00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:57,219
Don't be ridiculous, you're too valuable here!

396

How can T-Mat be repaired if I'm not there?

397
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:03,519
- What about (one of) the technicians (who was already over) there?
- Osgood's dead.

- Yes, well, what about Fewsham?
- He's incapable of doing it! I think I) should go!

just this emergency link can be.

Even if you had a gigantic army of warriors,

405
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:32,017
you couldn't send them all to conquer Earth.

- It could easily burn itself out.
- Sensible.

467
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:05,843

01:17:56,194 --> 01:18:00,392
(ZOE) It's no use. No contact
at all. Every circuit's dead.

- Don't try them again. You'll blow us up!

476

01:18:06,594 --> 01:18:09,904
- We're nearly there.
- I wanted to contact Earth.

478
01:18:10,074 --> 01:18:13,464
There's no need. We can activate
the moon homing beam.

479
01:18:13,634 --> 01:18:16,990
How? We've got no contact
with anyone on the moon.

480
01:18:17,154 --> 01:18:20,066
It's quite simple. It's an automatic device.

481
01:18:20,234 --> 01:18:24,147
Our code radio signals
trigger the homing beam into action.

482
01:18:24,314 --> 01:18:26,305
We automatically lock onto it

483
01:18:26,474 --> 01:18:30,592
until we reach the point in orbit
where we fire retro-rockets to land.

484
01:18:30,754 --> 01:18:33,985
If they've all been cut off,
how can they activate?

485
01:18:34,154 --> 01:18:37,464
It works off a different
power source - solar power.

486
01:18:37,634 --> 01:18:40,023
It's independent of the T-Mat system.

487
01:18:40,194 --> 01:18:41,673
I just hope it works.

488
01:18:41,834 --> 01:18:45,907
If it doesn't, we'll have trouble docking.
It could be quite a crash.

489
01:18:46,074 --> 01:18:48,349
Let's try. I think we're near enough.

01:18:49,514 --> 01:18:53,268
- (THREE-TONE SIGNAL)
- That's our activating signal.

491
01:18:54,274 --> 01:18:57,072
- (STEADY BEEP)
- As long as that note is steady,

492
01:18:57,234 --> 01:18:59,270

01:20:06,274 --> 01:20:10,233
- The homing beam, it's cut out!
- I'm trying to reactivate it!

504
01:20:10,394 --> 01:20:14,945
- You said it was infallible!
- The solar power source has been damaged.

505
01:20:15,114 --> 01:20:19,665
- That means trouble!
- Yes, it's impossible to land safely.

506
01:20:19,834 --> 01:20:24,385
- You mean we'll crash?
- Or drift endlessly through space.

They tricked me! I tried to stop them!

514

No matter. He will be found and killed.

515
02:00:31,874 --> 02:00:35,423
- What about me?
- Have you repaired the T-Mat link?

516
02:00:35,594 --> 02:00:38,427
- Not yet. It isn't easy!
- But it is possible?

02:00:38,594 --> 02:00:40,903
- Yes, only give me time!
- Very well,

519
02:00:41,074 --> 02:00:45,306
but now you know what will happen if you fail!

520
02:00:46,434 --> 02:00:49,631
You will die!

521
02:00:50,634 --> 02:00:55,264
Don't you see this goes far beyond
a petty quarrel over rockets and T-Mat?

522
02:00:55,434 --> 02:00:58,346
Those men are in trouble
and we must help them!

523
02:00:58,514 --> 02:01:01,745
- Find some other way!
- Your rocket is our only hope

524
02:01:01,914 --> 02:01:03,393
of reaching the moon.

525
02:01:03,554 --> 02:01:05,704
- Listen to them.
- I'm listening!

526
02:01:05,874 --> 02:01:08,468
In a way, this is a triumph for your rocket!

527
02:01:08,634 --> 02:01:11,865
- Is it?
- Yes! The government recognises the fact.

528
02:01:12,034 --> 02:01:15,185
Then the government is going to be disappointed!

529
02:01:18,394 --> 02:01:20,385
I don't understand you!

530
02:01:20,554 --> 02:01:24,547
I'll be frank. I played with the idea
of making a space flight,

531
02:01:24,714 --> 02:01:29,424
I even prepared a rocket,
but it was just a dream -

532
02:01:29,594 --> 02:01:31,789
an illusion for a disappointed man.

533
02:01:31,954 --> 02:01:35,629
- So there's nothing?
- The rocket's partially prepared.

534
02:01:35,794 --> 02:01:38,547
- As for an actual lift-off...
- We can do it!

535
02:01:38,714 --> 02:01:42,548
It takes more than enthusiasm
to get a rocket off the ground!

536
02:01:42,714 --> 02:01:47,663
- We have funds, men, equipment...
- What it needs, you haven't got - time!

537
02:01:47,834 --> 02:01:52,032
- We have the best technicians.
- It's nowhere near ready, woman!

538
02:01:52,194 --> 02:01:54,389
The equipment is still unchecked!

539
02:01:54,554 --> 02:01:58,024
- A computer can do that.
- It would still be dangerous!

540
02:02:01,234 --> 02:02:03,225
Daniel...

541
02:02:04,394 --> 02:02:06,624
It was you who created this rocket.

542
02:02:07,794 --> 02:02:12,709
It was your driving force and enthusiasm
that got it off the drawing board.

543
02:02:12,874 --> 02:02:16,389
With you in control, we can't fail to succeed!

544
02:02:16,554 --> 02:02:19,307
That was a long time past.

545
02:02:19,474 --> 02:02:22,864
Now my heart couldn't take
the strain of the G-force.

546
02:02:23,034 --> 02:02:26,310
But your experience and knowledge
aren't useless.

547
02:02:26,474 --> 02:02:28,590
- We need your guidance.
- No!

548
02:02:35,474 --> 02:02:37,829
I told you it's a dream!

549
02:02:38,474 --> 02:02:42,387
I can never go to the moon
and neither can rocket ZA 685!

550
02:05:06,994 --> 02:05:08,791
- Doctor...
- Yes?

551
02:05:08,954 --> 02:05:12,549
- Are you all planning to crew the rocket?
- Oh, aye!

552
02:05:12,714 --> 02:05:16,343
- I hadn't thought about you.
- You're not leaving me behind!

553
02:05:16,514 --> 02:05:20,302
- There can be no excess weight.
- How many does this thing hold?

554
02:05:20,474 --> 02:05:23,910
- It was designed for three men.
- Well, then, I'm going!

555
02:05:24,074 --> 02:05:28,306
The fuel stocks are barely adequate
for a moon journey and return.

556
02:05:28,474 --> 02:05:31,511
- What about other sources?
- New York and Moscow.

557
02:05:31,674 --> 02:05:35,110
- Transit impossible.
- We're only getting TO the moon.

558
02:05:35,274 --> 02:05:37,742
We'll come back by T-Mat, won't we?

559
02:05:37,914 --> 02:05:39,905
It depends what's wrong with it.

560
02:05:40,074 --> 02:05:44,545
The moon has a fuel dump
and a refuelling system on the landing bay.

561
02:05:44,714 --> 02:05:47,023
But that hasn't been used for years!

562
02:05:47,194 --> 02:05:51,233
Neither has the radio homing beam.
Without it, you won't land at all!

563
02:05:51,394 --> 02:05:54,147
In that case, why worry about getting back (?)

564
02:05:54,314 --> 02:05:57,704
The equipment's fully automated
and solar-powered.

565
02:05:57,874 --> 02:06:00,991
- No reason why it shouldn't work.
- I'm sure it will.

566
02:06:01,154 --> 02:06:05,545
- Will you remember all I told you?
- Even if I don't, Zoe has total recall.

567
02:06:05,714 --> 02:06:08,911
- Well, I've written it all down.
- There's no need.

568
02:06:09,074 --> 02:06:11,304
And there's a map of Moonbase, too.

569
02:06:13,874 --> 02:06:16,468
You know how to operate the homing beam?

570
02:06:16,634 --> 02:06:19,626

They come from the planet Mars.

- What do they want?
- Mars is a dying planet.

- They want a new home.
- Why the moon?

- They're Ice Warriors?

If you invade the Earth,

666

- Mr Phipps, I presume?
- Yes, but where did you come from?

676
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:47,614
From the rocket. We were talking on the radio.

677
00:20:47,776 --> 00:20:50,988
- Are the others here too?
- Yeah, They're still in the rocket.

678
00:20:51,156 --> 00:20:54,949
- How many Ice Warriors are there?
- Those creatures you mean?

679
00:20:55,016 --> 00:20:58,128
- Not many, but they're deadly.
- They have their weak points.

680
00:20:58,196 --> 00:21:02,531
Look, they've killed everybody here,
except Fewsham, who's helping them.

681
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:05,869
I see. Well, there's only one thing for it.

682
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:08,824
- We shall have to destroy T-Mat.

683
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:14,251
You will shortly dispatch a cargo
to certain cities on Earth.

684
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,653
Cargo? What sort of cargo?

685
00:21:24,696 --> 00:21:28,291
That's an Ice Warrior's. It's got Miss Kelly, but how...?

686

- He's not one of the crew.

Impossible - we control T-Mat.
How did you get here?

704

Our resources are not limited
to T-Mat, you know!

00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:57,290
He's dead. An Ice Warrior killed him.

How did you manage to escape?

837
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:02,037
- The other man helped me.
- Fewsham? I thought he was working for them?

838
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:04,874
- He saved my life.
- Doesn't sound much like Fewsham.

839
00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:08,820
- He attacked the Ice Warrior. He's also got T-Mat working again.
- (DOCTOR) Do I gether we can get back to Earth?

840
00:36:08,981 --> 00:36:11,541
- I think so.

I had to help them or they would have killed me!

844
00:36:45,521 --> 00:36:48,030
All right, Fewsham. There'll be a full inquiry when we get back to Earth. Tell them.

845
00:36:48,201 --> 00:36:51,671
No more time to waste.
We must T-Mat back to Earth immediately.

846
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:55,516
- But if we all are going, who is going to dispatch us?
- There's a way of doing that.

847
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:58,712
Here, this time switch delays
transportation by ten seconds.

848
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:02,312
Oh, I see, how genius. I'll dispatch you and follow you using the time switch.

849
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:05,598
Right, so Zoe, Jamie, come along. I think this could be quite fun!

850
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:09,754
Fewsham, that time switch was down on the maintenance report for being  inoperable.

851
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:11,559
We repaired it!

In you get, Miss Kelly. I'll use the time switch.

854
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:22,196
You better hurry. Those Ice Warriors will be back any minute.

855
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:29,360
Do you know, I find T-Mat travel
rather disappointing.

856
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:31,477
There's no sensation at all!

857
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:34,031
Where have you been? And what were you being up to all this time?

858
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:36,792
Where's... Miss Kelly! What's happening up there?

859
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:39,337
Will someone tell me
what's happening down here?!

860
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:41,615
Who are these people? Is T-Mat working?

861
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:45,572
Now, please, don't... Let us just one question at a time!

862
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:48,075
Doctor, do you know there's been an alien here?

863
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:51,213
- An Ice Warrior HERE?!
- Jamie, I am not surprised.

864
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:53,372
They have taken over the whole Moonbase.

865
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:56,613
- What about the crew?
- All dead except Fewsham.

866
00:37:56,781 --> 00:38:00,251
- You left him there?
- He said he'd follow using the time switch.

867
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:03,140
He should be back.

868
00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:07,532
What's happening?

869
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:09,834
I thought so!
The time switch is still out of order.

870
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:13,590
- What? But he said he had repaired it.
- He was lying.

871
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:16,316
- Why?
- Obviously he's working for them!

872
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:19,472
Then why did he let us escape?

873
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:28,511

00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,440
(HISSING, LABOURED BREATHING)

875
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:12,173
But don't you see, gentlmen? 
The invasion of Moonbase,
the taking over of T-Mat, 

876
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:16,050
the seed pods, the arrival of the Ice Warrior,
they're all part of the same plan.

877
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,700
Plan? What plan?

878
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:21,631
These incidents seem unrelated.
This fungus everywhere,
what's that got to do with it?

879
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:24,454
I'm not quite sure yet. Have you people been able to make anything of it?

880
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:28,734
It's indestructible.
We've attacked it with every possible way, but without success.

881
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:31,495
Yes, but have you tried to understand it?

882
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,334
You suggest we should psychoanalyse it, Doctor?

883
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:38,779
I'm merely suggesting that rather than destroy it, you should
find out its composition and purpose.

884
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:41,751
I have some laboratory equipment
in my workshop. You could use that.

885
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:44,614
- Good. Then we need a sample.
- No problem about that.

886
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:47,275
- The gardens are full of the stuff.
- Fine. The let no time to be lost.

887
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:48,965
I'll get some equipment for you.

888
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:52,850
Doctor, do be careful. Those pod things are deadly.

889
00:39:52,921 --> 00:39:56,038
Don't worry. I've already had experience. I'll be careful.

890
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:02,657
(DOCTOR) Yes... It's organic.

891
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:04,812
It's alive.

892
00:40:04,981 --> 00:40:07,814
It's definitely a fungus composition.

893
00:40:07,981 --> 00:40:11,615
- Are you sure this is correct?
- As far as I can make out, it is.

894
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:15,276
A molecule of five atoms...absorbs oxygen.

895
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:18,438
You know,  a complete blanket of this

896
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:23,199
would reduce the oxygen content
of the Earth's atmosphere drastically.

897
00:40:23,261 --> 00:40:26,936
According to my calculations,
to one twentieth normal.

898
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:30,299
It would make the Earth's atmosphere
uninhabitable to the human race,

899
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,680
but exactly like the atmosphere of Mars!

900
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:39,752
Look at that. Even without vegetation
to feed on, it's still active. Oh!

(ELDRED) If that thing explodes here, the fumes will kill us! Come on, Doctor!

902
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,714
Just a minute. There must be some way of...

903
00:40:51,441 --> 00:40:54,831
(ELDRED) Come on!
(DOCTOR) Sulphuric acid!

904
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,356
Hydrochloric acid!

905
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:01,312
Acetic acid!

906
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:13,192
(ELDRED) You've done it!

907
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:16,034
Well, what was it? What did you throw on it?

908
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:21,451
- You really think it would work?
- Well It could be less effective than Moonbase, of course.

which handles up to two million microwave channels simultaneously,

910
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:26,675
the satellite would just take a few thousand.

911
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:28,791
That would be enough for vital food supplies.

912
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:32,410
But we can't use normal communications satellites.
They are not programmed for T-Mat.

913
00:41:32,581 --> 00:41:34,474
No. We have to send up a specially       programmed one.

914
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,151
That would mean using a rocket, wouldn't it? I thought no one use them nowadays.

915
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:40,814
Not manned rockets, but we do send up satellites for communications.

916
00:41:40,981 --> 00:41:44,796
- How soon can you get one up?
- Well, I don't know. If we're given top priority...

- What do you want me to do?
- <i>Get hold of the Weather Control Bureau people</i>

<i>over the entire country!</i>

Of course not, but since their fuel
supplies are at a marginal level,

You can't expect immediate results.

997
00:47:20,218 --> 00:47:25,069
- Are you sure you're getting it right?
- Yeah, I hope so, Zoe. Just have to hope for the best. That's all.

998
00:47:25,138 --> 00:47:27,688
I must get on as there's another little job I want to do.

999
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:36,675
We should have some nice heavy rain before long!

1002
00:47:42,798 --> 00:47:45,790
- We've finished and installed the homing device. It's working perfectly.
- Well done.

1003
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:49,011
Doctor, I know we're sending up a false signal,

1004
00:47:49,178 --> 00:47:52,250
but aren't some of the Martian ships bound to follow the right one?

1005
00:47:52,418 --> 00:47:55,476
There isn't going to be a right one, there's going to be only ours, the wrong one,

1006
00:47:55,538 --> 00:47:59,277
and that's going to lead the entire Martian fleet
into an orbit round the sun!

1007
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:02,228
- What about Slaar's signal?
- Obviously that has to be stopped.

1008
00:48:02,348 --> 00:48:04,308
- But how?
- Well, as soon as that satellite is up

1009
00:48:04,398 --> 00:48:07,747
I shall T-Mat myself to the moon
and destroy their homing device.

1010
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:09,870
- They'll kill you on sight!
- No, I don't think so.

00:48:09,998 --> 00:48:13,235

1017
00:48:36,778 --> 00:48:38,688
you must activate our signal in the satellite.

- We'll be ready.
- Right, then I'll be off.

- Don't worry, Zoe, I will.

- Doctor, our control of T-Mat hasn't been tested!
