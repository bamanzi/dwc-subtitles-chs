1
00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:34,096
Stop him!

2
00:09:37,424 --> 00:09:41,019
(RASPING WHISPER)
Hunt that man! He must not escape!

3
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:43,977
Can we not help them? We can use the Tardis!

4
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:48,196
To go to the moon? We'd probably
overshoot by a few million years!

5
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:50,355
Yes, or by a few million miles!

6
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:53,596
The Tardis is not suited to short-range travel.

7
00:09:53,764 --> 00:09:55,573
Still, we should help them if we can.

8
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,133
- Aye.
- Yes.

9
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:05,243
- I could get your rocket to the moon.
- You?

10
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:09,399
Yes, I have considerable experience
in space travel.

11
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:10,855
That's splendid! Thank you!

12
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:15,717
- But the rocket is not ready!
- Perhaps you overestimate the difficulty.

13
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:18,657
How much more work is required?

14
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:21,896
It needs fuel
and a complete computerised check.

15
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:25,181
- I can order that.
- No! The risk is too great!

16
00:10:25,344 --> 00:10:26,335
If there was some other way,

17
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:29,302
- I wouldn't even consider such a risk!
- No!

You don't understand! It's suicide!

26

Listen, if this fault lasts much longer,

27
00:11:00,824 --> 00:11:05,181
there's going to be worldwide chaos,
and world population is at stake.

- Miss Kelly.
- Sir.

35
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:31,136
I want all technical personnel working on this.

36
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:34,137
I want that rocket prepared for launching!

37
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:36,295
Yes, Commander.

38
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:42,016
We'd be grateful for your help.

you'll need a miracle!

43
00:12:12,924 --> 00:12:15,313
- Commander.
- Yes, Miss Kelly?

44
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,556
Is it wise letting these people crew the rocket?

45
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:23,236
What's the alternative?
We gave up training astronauts years ago.

46
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:26,514
- Who are they?
- Eldred's crazy friends, I imagine,

47
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:30,518
- but the Doctor knows his space travel.
- How can you be sure?

48
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:34,154
He and the girl know
more about space flight than Eldred.

49
00:12:34,324 --> 00:12:37,634
- What about the boy?
- I'm not sure about him.

(RASPING WHISPER)
The emergency link with Earth,

51
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:43,758
- is it ready yet?
- I've nearly finished.

52
00:12:43,824 --> 00:12:46,636
- Do not make any mistakes!
- I'm not an expert!

53
00:12:46,704 --> 00:12:48,695
- But you will do it?
- Yes!

54
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:53,743
Commander, I think I should go
as crew on the rocket.

55
00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:57,219
Don't be ridiculous, you're too valuable here!

56
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:59,752
How can T-Mat be repaired if I'm not there?

57
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:03,519
- What about (one of) the technicians (who was already over) there?
- Osgood's dead.

58
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:09,195
- Yes, well, what about Fewsham?
- He's incapable of doing it! I think I) should go!

59
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:13,152
No! You're the only one
who really understands T-Mat.

60

I can't have you risking your life!

61
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:18,192
But (yet you are perfectly prepared to) allow them to risk theirs!

62
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,063
Don't worry, (Miss Kelly) we'll be perfectly all right!

63
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:26,397
But I don't see what good
just this emergency link can be.

64
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,017
Even if you had a gigantic army of warriors,

65
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:32,017
you couldn't send them all to conquer Earth.

66
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:34,778
(RASPING WHISPER)
We do not need an army.

67
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:37,139
Earth will be ours for the taking...

<i>Yes, (I know) we're to re-establish video link with the Earth.</i>

That's right.

73
00:13:57,624 --> 00:13:59,615
When we can see what's wrong,

74
00:13:59,784 --> 00:14:03,094
you can do the rest
under Miss Kelly's supervision.

- What are you going to do?
- Do not ask questions!

85

Activate the link.

00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:43,092
- On receive only.
- Receive?

87
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:45,451
But aren't you going to...?

88
00:14:45,614 --> 00:14:47,923
Activate the link on receive at once!

- (KELLY) You've double-checked?
<i>- Yes, the fault is on Moonbase.</i>

00:14:52,014 --> 00:14:54,387
Are you able to effect repairs over video?

91
00:14:54,454 --> 00:14:56,445
the fault is not too major.

00:14:56,614 --> 00:15:00,163
- And if they get there with the rocket!
- They'll get there.

Commander, you've stopped me once.

106

Don't try it again, otherwise
I shall have to go above your head.

- Thank heavens you've come!
- What happened?

00:16:09,154 --> 00:16:13,447
Osgood, it must have been space madness.
He just went berserk!

111
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,750
Osgood? But he'd be the last man,
I'd have thought!

112
00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:19,064
- So did we.
- Where are the others?

113
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:22,829
When Osgood fused the controls,
Locke tried to stop him.

114
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:25,588
- Osgood killed him.
- This is fantastic!

115
00:16:25,754 --> 00:16:29,303
- What about Phipps?
- He's injured and under sedation.

116

- And you?
- There's nothing wrong with me.

117

You look frightened.

118
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:36,547
If you'd seen Osgood die, wouldn't you be?

119
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:39,148
How did he die?

120
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:41,111
His body's outside.

121
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:42,787
He just went out.

Without a pressure suit? I see.

123
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,871
Open all control sections and computer links.

Fewsham, what are you doing?

125
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:58,953
I'd best switch off the emergency link.

126
00:16:59,114 --> 00:17:02,265
- It could easily burn itself out.
- Sensible.

127
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:05,843
It will prevent Commander Radnor sending a security guard
