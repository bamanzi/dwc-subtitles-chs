(RASPING WHISPER)
Hunt that man! He must not escape!

3
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:43,977
Can we not help them? We can use the Tardis!

4
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:48,196
To go to the moon? We'd probably
overshoot by a few million years!

5
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:50,355
Yes, or by a few million miles!

6
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:53,596
The Tardis is not suited to short-range travel.

7
00:09:53,764 --> 00:09:55,573
Still, we should help them if we can.

8
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,133
- Aye.
- Yes.

9
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:05,243

- You?

Yes, I have considerable experience
in space travel.

That's splendid! Thank you!

12

- But the rocket is not ready!
- Perhaps you overestimate the difficulty.

13
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:18,657
How much more work is required?

14
00:10:18,824 --> 00:10:21,896
It needs fuel
and a complete computerised check.

15
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:25,181
- I can order that.
- No! The risk is too great!

16

If there was some other way,

17
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:29,302

- Eldred's crazy friends, I imagine,

How? We've got no contact
with anyone on the moon.

140
01:18:17,154 --> 01:18:20,066
It's quite simple. It's an automatic device.

141
01:18:20,234 --> 01:18:24,147
Our code radio signals
trigger the homing beam into action.

where we fire retro-rockets to land.

If they've all been cut off,
how can they activate?

145
01:18:34,154 --> 01:18:37,464
It works off a different
power source - solar power.

146
01:18:37,634 --> 01:18:40,023
It's independent of the T-Mat system.

(HISSING, LABOURED BREATHING)

169
01:48:42,834 --> 01:48:44,631
Guard!

170
01:48:48,954 --> 01:48:50,592
Kill him!

171
01:48:52,154 --> 01:48:54,952
(TRILLING BUZZ)

172
02:00:21,914 --> 02:00:25,224
You allowed them to send a message
back to Earth!

173
02:00:25,394 --> 02:00:27,783
They tricked me! I tried to stop them!

174
02:00:27,954 --> 02:00:31,708
No matter. He will be found and killed.

175
02:00:31,874 --> 02:00:35,423
- What about me?
- Have you repaired the T-Mat link?

176
02:00:35,594 --> 02:00:38,427
- Not yet. It isn't easy!
- But it is possible?

177
02:00:36,234 --> 02:00:40,227
(HISSING, LABOURED BREATHING)

178
02:00:38,594 --> 02:00:40,903
- Yes, only give me time!
- Very well,

179
02:00:41,074 --> 02:00:45,306
but now you know what will happen if you fail!

180
02:00:46,434 --> 02:00:49,631
You will die!

181
02:00:50,634 --> 02:00:55,264
Don't you see this goes far beyond
a petty quarrel over rockets and T-Mat?

182
02:00:55,434 --> 02:00:58,346
Those men are in trouble
and we must help them!

183
02:00:58,514 --> 02:01:01,745
- Find some other way!
- Your rocket is our only hope

184
02:01:01,914 --> 02:01:03,393
of reaching the moon.

185
02:01:03,554 --> 02:01:05,704
- Listen to them.
- I'm listening!

186
02:01:05,874 --> 02:01:08,468
In a way, this is a triumph for your rocket!

187
02:01:08,634 --> 02:01:11,865
- Is it?
- Yes! The government recognises the fact.

188
02:01:12,034 --> 02:01:15,185
Then the government is going to be disappointed!

189
02:01:18,394 --> 02:01:20,385
I don't understand you!

190
02:01:20,554 --> 02:01:24,547
I'll be frank. I played with the idea
of making a space flight,

191
02:01:24,714 --> 02:01:29,424
I even prepared a rocket,
but it was just a dream -

192
02:01:29,594 --> 02:01:31,789
an illusion for a disappointed man.

193
02:01:31,954 --> 02:01:35,629
- So there's nothing?
- The rocket's partially prepared.

194
02:01:35,794 --> 02:01:38,547
- As for an actual lift-off...
- We can do it!

195
02:01:38,714 --> 02:01:42,548
It takes more than enthusiasm
to get a rocket off the ground!

196
02:01:42,714 --> 02:01:47,663
- We have funds, men, equipment...
- What it needs, you haven't got - time!

197
02:01:47,834 --> 02:01:52,032
- We have the best technicians.
- It's nowhere near ready, woman!

198
02:01:52,194 --> 02:01:54,389
The equipment is still unchecked!

199
02:01:54,554 --> 02:01:58,024
- A computer can do that.
- It would still be dangerous!

200
02:02:01,234 --> 02:02:03,225
Daniel...

201
02:02:04,394 --> 02:02:06,624
It was you who created this rocket.

202
02:02:07,794 --> 02:02:12,709
It was your driving force and enthusiasm
that got it off the drawing board.

203
02:02:12,874 --> 02:02:16,389
With you in control, we can't fail to succeed!

204
02:02:16,554 --> 02:02:19,307
That was a long time past.

205
02:02:19,474 --> 02:02:22,864
Now my heart couldn't take
the strain of the G-force.

206
02:02:23,034 --> 02:02:26,310
But your experience and knowledge
aren't useless.

207
02:02:26,474 --> 02:02:28,590
- We need your guidance.
- No!

208
02:02:35,474 --> 02:02:37,829
I told you it's a dream!

209
02:02:38,474 --> 02:02:42,387
I can never go to the moon
and neither can rocket ZA 685!

210
02:05:06,994 --> 02:05:08,791
- Doctor...
- Yes?

211
02:05:08,954 --> 02:05:12,549
- Are you all planning to crew the rocket?
- Oh, aye!

212
02:05:12,714 --> 02:05:16,343
- I hadn't thought about you.
- You're not leaving me behind!

213
02:05:16,514 --> 02:05:20,302
- There can be no excess weight.
- How many does this thing hold?

214
02:05:20,474 --> 02:05:23,910
- It was designed for three men.
- Well, then, I'm going!

215
02:05:24,074 --> 02:05:28,306
The fuel stocks are barely adequate
for a moon journey and return.

216
02:05:28,474 --> 02:05:31,511
- What about other sources?
- New York and Moscow.

217
02:05:31,674 --> 02:05:35,110
- Transit impossible.
- We're only getting TO the moon.

218
02:05:35,274 --> 02:05:37,742
We'll come back by T-Mat, won't we?

219
02:05:37,914 --> 02:05:39,905
It depends what's wrong with it.

220
02:05:40,074 --> 02:05:44,545
The moon has a fuel dump
and a refuelling system on the landing bay.

221
02:05:44,714 --> 02:05:47,023
But that hasn't been used for years!

222
02:05:47,194 --> 02:05:51,233
Neither has the radio homing beam.
Without it, you won't land at all!

223
02:05:51,394 --> 02:05:54,147
In that case, why worry about getting back (?)

224
02:05:54,314 --> 02:05:57,704
The equipment's fully automated
and solar-powered.

225
02:05:57,874 --> 02:06:00,991
- No reason why it shouldn't work.
- I'm sure it will.

226
02:06:01,154 --> 02:06:05,545
- Will you remember all I told you?
- Even if I don't, Zoe has total recall.

227
02:06:05,714 --> 02:06:08,911
- Well, I've written it all down.
- There's no need.

228
02:06:09,074 --> 02:06:11,304
And there's a map of Moonbase, too.

229
02:06:13,874 --> 02:06:16,468
You know how to operate the homing beam?

230
02:06:16,634 --> 02:06:19,626
Don't worry. Your rocket will be in good hands.

231
02:06:19,794 --> 02:06:21,273
(JAMIE) A-hem!

232
02:06:21,434 --> 02:06:24,073

- Well done! Record time and not a thing wrong!
- So far!

Three minutes.

Clear launching site.

248
02:09:53,594 --> 02:09:55,983
Three minutes seem a long time.

249
02:09:56,154 --> 02:09:59,544
Yes. You remember
your take-off briefing, Jamie?

250
02:09:59,714 --> 02:10:02,911
Aye, he's told me
about this G-force stuff. I know!

251
02:10:03,074 --> 02:10:06,464
You don't know about it
until you've experienced it!

<i>(KELLY) Tminus 60 seconds from now.</i>

253

One minute to go. Hold tight, everyone!

254
02:10:12,314 --> 02:10:14,987
Well, I'm all right. How about you, Jamie?

255
02:10:15,154 --> 02:10:17,145
I keep telling you - I'm fine!

256

<i>(KELLY) Tminus 50.</i>

257

Don't worry! Everything's
been checked and rechecked!

259
02:10:26,154 --> 02:10:29,783
- T minus 40. Technicians, report.
- (BRENT) All areas clear.

260
02:10:29,954 --> 02:10:31,706
Check all systems.

261
02:10:31,874 --> 02:10:33,865
- We have.
- We must make sure!

262
02:10:34,034 --> 02:10:37,504
T minus...30.

We have lift-off!

268
02:13:41,474 --> 02:13:45,990
(RADNOR) I never thought I'd see
that again - a rocket rising in flight!

269
02:13:46,154 --> 02:13:48,145
Beautiful!

270
02:13:48,314 --> 02:13:50,384
Let's see how they are.

271
02:13:51,874 --> 02:13:53,466
The link is dead!

272
02:13:54,474 --> 02:13:58,433
Something must have gone wrong
on lift-off! Try the second channel.

273
02:13:59,394 --> 02:14:02,750
- Nothing.
- We're out of touch completely?!

274
02:14:09,314 --> 02:14:11,305
What about radio link?

275
02:14:12,394 --> 02:14:16,467
Earth Control to rocket.
How do you read me? Over.

276
02:14:16,634 --> 02:14:19,228
No, nothing but static!

277
02:14:19,394 --> 02:14:21,544
It's only a minor fault, surely?

278
02:14:22,874 --> 02:14:26,184
<i>(KELLY) Earth Control to rocket.</i>
<i>How do you read me?</i>

279
02:14:26,354 --> 02:14:30,347
Don't release the strap until
we have automatic gravity control,

280
02:14:30,514 --> 02:14:32,584
otherwise you'll float away.

281
02:14:32,754 --> 02:14:35,222
<i>- (KELLY) Earth Control to rocket!</i>
- Wait!

282
02:14:35,394 --> 02:14:38,227
Switching to automatic gravity control now!

283
02:14:38,394 --> 02:14:39,952
Try again.

284
02:14:40,114 --> 02:14:42,105

02:14:42,274 --> 02:14:45,983
<i>(ZOE) Rocket to Earth Control.</i>
<i>Wait a minute, can't you?</i>

286
02:14:46,154 --> 02:14:49,988
Is everything all right?
We've lost our video monitor link.

287
02:14:50,154 --> 02:14:54,784
<i>(DOCTOR) Yes, I think there must be</i>
<i>a fault in one of the circuits.</i>

288
02:14:56,154 --> 02:14:58,145
Doctor? Doctor!

289
02:14:58,994 --> 02:15:01,588
- (ZOE) What is it?
- A circuit's burnt out.

290
02:15:01,754 --> 02:15:05,508
- I'll switch to another one.
- This is worse than the Tardis!

291
02:15:05,674 --> 02:15:08,268
Do you read me, Doctor?!

292
02:15:08,434 --> 02:15:13,144
It sounds as though the entire
communications circuitry has blown out!

293
02:15:13,314 --> 02:15:16,306
Yes. Let's hope that's all that's happened!

294
02:15:16,474 --> 02:15:18,385
Keep trying, Miss Kelly.
