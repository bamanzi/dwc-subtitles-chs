00:56:30,328 --> 00:56:33,282
(JAMIE) You didn't have to make it
rain as hard as all that!

152
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,657
Oh, Jamie, some of you is just never satisfied!

153
00:56:35,828 --> 00:56:40,280
- What did you rush us back here for?
- Oh, you know, questions and explanations are very difficult. Come on!

154
00:56:40,648 --> 00:56:42,611
- Where are we going now?
- It's no good asking him.

155
00:56:42,728 --> 00:56:44,922
He's no more idea than the man in the moon!

156
00:56:45,188 --> 00:56:47,656
I heard that, Jamie! Come on!
