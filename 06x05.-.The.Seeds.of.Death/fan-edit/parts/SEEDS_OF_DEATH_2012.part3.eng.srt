00:17:42,156 --> 00:17:45,432
Hello, Moonbase! Can you hear me?

2
00:17:47,396 --> 00:17:48,375
Yes!

3
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:50,666
Yes, I can hear you loud and clear!

4
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,460
What part of Earth are you speaking from?

5
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:56,108
<i>(DOCTOR) We're in a rocket orbiting the moon.</i>

6
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,167
A rocket? But that's impossible!

7
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:02,948
I can assure you it's not impossible!
What is your emergency?

8
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,107
What's happening on Moonbase?

9
00:18:05,276 --> 00:18:08,268
<i>We've been invaded! Aliens have taken over!</i>

10
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:13,505
Put that cover back on.

11
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:17,529
T-Mat to Earth and report to Commander Radnor.

12
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,687
(RASPING WHISPER)
Stop!

13
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:22,416
You will remain here!

14
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:24,886
(HISSING, LABOURED BREATHING)

15
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:27,248
These aliens he described...

16
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,486
- Yes, Ice Warriors!
- What?

17
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:32,473
Jamie and I have met them before.
They come from the planet Mars.

18
00:18:32,536 --> 00:18:35,089
- What do they want?
- Mars is a dying planet.

19
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,065
- They want a new home.
- Why the moon?

20
00:18:38,136 --> 00:18:41,692
- It's a stepping stone.
- They're Ice Warriors?

21
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:45,326
Yes, you know, Mars is a cold planet
and they've adapted to that.

22
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:47,487
It's heat they can't stand.

23
00:18:47,656 --> 00:18:51,126
We should just about be coming into range now.

24
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,988
Hello, Moonbase. 

25
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:03,270
(RASPING WHISPER)
You will remain here!

26
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:17,668
That's the lot. The whole system's
completely operational again.

27
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:22,290
- We can now send to any city in the world?
- Yes, anywhere with a T-Mat centre.

28
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:26,368
- Fewsham, Do you realise what you're doing?!
- I'm trying to save our lives!

29
00:19:26,436 --> 00:19:29,288
We're in no position to argue!

30
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:34,444
Why do you want control of T-Mat?

31
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:37,154
If you invade the Earth,

32
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:41,447
you'll fight the armed forces
of the entire world. You'll never succeed.

33
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:44,889
- There'll be too much resistance.
- There will be no resistance!

34
00:19:44,956 --> 00:19:46,912
What will happen to us?

35
00:19:46,976 --> 00:19:51,049
You will remain alive as long as you are useful.

36
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:55,731
You'll never get any help from me.

37
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:59,855
When the time comes, you will do
exactly what you are told...

38
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:03,452
..or die!

39
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:37,894
Hello?

40
00:20:38,056 --> 00:20:40,809
- Who are you?
- Oh!

41
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:44,571
- Mr Phipps, I presume?
- Yes, but where did you come from?

42
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:47,614
From the rocket. We were talking on the radio.

43
00:20:47,776 --> 00:20:50,988
- Are the others here too?
- Yeah, They're still in the rocket.

44
00:20:51,156 --> 00:20:54,949
- How many Ice Warriors are there?
- Those creatures you mean?

45
00:20:55,016 --> 00:20:58,128
- Not many, but they're deadly.
- They have their weak points.

46
00:20:58,196 --> 00:21:02,531
Look, they've killed everybody here,
except Fewsham, who's helping them.

47
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:05,869
I see. Well, there's only one thing for it.

48
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:08,824
- We shall have to destroy T-Mat.

49
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:14,251
You will shortly dispatch a cargo
to certain cities on Earth.

50
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,653
Cargo? What sort of cargo?

51
00:21:24,696 --> 00:21:28,291
That's an Ice Warrior's. It's got Miss Kelly, but how...?

52
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:32,692
Run!

53
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:41,535
Oh!

54
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,375
Stop!

55
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:48,767
(RASPING WHISPER)
You must be destroyed!

56
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:50,927
You've got no orders to kill me!

57
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:53,774
Your leader will want to speak to me!

58
00:22:53,836 --> 00:22:56,127
Humans are our enemies!

59
00:22:56,296 --> 00:22:59,049
But I can be useful to you, like Fewsham!

60
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:03,687
Your leader will be angry with you
if you kill me! I'm a genius!

61
00:23:03,856 --> 00:23:06,689
(RASPING WHISPER)
Genius!

62
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:11,088
You will come with me!

63
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:18,388
The prisoner Kelly has escaped.

64
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:23,191
This human was in the corridors.

65
00:23:23,356 --> 00:23:26,314
Who are you? Where are you from?

66
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:29,149
I might ask you the same question!

67
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:32,706
You will find the human Kelly
and bring her back here!

68
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:36,789
- Who is this man?
- He's not one of the crew.

69
00:23:36,956 --> 00:23:390,39
He must have just arrived here.

70
00:23:39,556 --> 00:23:42,912
Impossible - we control T-Mat.
How did you get here?

71
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:46,148
Our resources are not limited
to T-Mat, you know!

72
00:23:46,316 --> 00:23:51,007
- You arrived by space craft?
- Rockets haven't been used for years.

73
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:53,465
Then you are lying!

74
00:23:53,636 --> 00:23:57,788
You have been concealed here all the time.

75
00:23:57,956 --> 00:24:01,710
(DOCTOR) But you can't be sure
of that, can you, hmm?

76
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:03,867
The people of the Earth

77
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:07,627
may be preparing a whole fleet
of rockets to defend themselves with!

78
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:11,668
(ICE WARRIOR)
No, Earth relies entirely on T-Mat.

79
00:24:11,836 --> 00:24:14,953
There is no defence against our plans.

80
00:24:15,116 --> 00:24:18,472
And what are your plans? Invasion by T-Mat?

81
00:24:19,676 --> 00:24:22,793
There are too few of you to conquer all Earth.

82
00:24:28,436 --> 00:24:32,873
(ICE WARRIOR) The Grand Marshall
has ordered the seeds to be prepared!

83
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:37,632
- You are to receive your instructions.
- Then guard the humans.

84
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:41,311
If they try to escape, kill them!

85
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:46,072
(HISSING, LABOURED BREATHING)

86
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:04,105
Why are you helping them?

87
00:25:04,276 --> 00:25:06,267
I've seen what they can do!

88
00:25:06,436 --> 00:25:08,996
Do you know what is in that container?

89
00:25:09,156 --> 00:25:12,785
All I know is they want me to send
something to Earth by T-Mat.

90
00:25:12,956 --> 00:25:16,744
- I suppose that's what's in it.
- I shall have to look inside,

91
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,225
and you are going to help me!

92
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:23,609
- The Doctor's been captured?
- There was nothing we could do.

93
00:25:23,676 --> 00:25:26,713
- We had a job to reach here ourselves.
- Aye. So did we!

94
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:28,890
Are you sure the Ice Warriors don't know about this place?

95
00:25:29,556 --> 00:25:34,301
One dit but I got him with a booby trap fixed to the solar energy power line.

96
00:25:34,356 --> 00:25:36,053
It looks those things are invulnerable!

97
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:39,586
- No, the Doctor said they can't stand heat.
- That's right!

The heating controlled from the Centre.

99
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,350
We can turn up the heating.

100
00:25:44,516 --> 00:25:47,147
But how can we get there? Ice Warriors are patrolling those corridors.

101
00:25:47,216 --> 00:25:50,305
Aye, Yes I know. The maintenance tunnel's over here!

102

(WHISPERS)
All right, Fewsham, now!

103
00:26:06,756 --> 00:26:08,747
I can't! They'll kill us both!

104
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:11,350
- You've got to help me!
- I can't, I daren't.

105
00:26:12,496 --> 00:26:14,691
Very well, I shall do it by myself.

106
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:18,849
If I am caught, which is most likely,
we will both get killed.

I said, ''Open it''!

119

What are these things?

120
00:27:17,216 --> 00:27:19,207

What's happened to him?

124

Is he dead?

125
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:42,486
We can get through it here then. Turn the heating up, knock the Warriors out

126

- We can rescue the Doctor.
- And T-Mat ourselves back to Earth.

- But T-Mat's broken down.
- I repaired it.
