- Morning. Just as well you've arrived!

01:03:05,627 --> 01:03:09,506
The sooner you take over from Fewsham on Moon Control the better!

All T-Mat consignments
are five minutes behind schedule.

177
01:03:13,307 --> 01:03:17,095
Fewsham routed a Moscow consignment
through to Canberra.

178
01:03:17,267 --> 01:03:20,737
- He's a lunatic!
- You shouldn't have recommended him

179
01:03:20,907 --> 01:03:23,216
for an assistant controller's job.

180
01:03:23,387 --> 01:03:26,459
Yes, I know now,
but I thought he deserved a break.

181
01:03:26,627 --> 01:03:31,018
He'll do something disastrous one day
and you'll have to answer for it!

182
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:35,385
- So, I'll work in a synthetics factory!
- It's your career!

183
01:03:35,547 --> 01:03:38,619
So it is! Have you
a T-Mat cubicle ready for me?

184
01:03:38,787 --> 01:03:41,699
- Yes, Number 6.
- See you later.

It's lucky he got here

Yes. He's late.

Good morning, Brent.
Good morning, Gia. All functioning well?

Of course, Commander Radnor.

199
01:04:45,187 --> 01:04:48,418
In your case, efficiency and charm
go hand in hand!

I thought the system was infallible.

- Brent, is there any obvious damage?
- None reported. All links stable.

Then it must be Moonbase!

We've no way of checking
their apparatus from this end.

- Commander Radnor's at a meeting.
- He'll expect a full report.

There it is.
We've even checked the computer.

the cause of the breakdown?

- Miss Kelly!

hounding me.

They expect a more informative
answer, and so do I!

01:16:16,827 --> 01:16:19,660
There isn't one. The trouble is at Moonbase.

- We can't get there.

267

We can't even talk to them.

268
01:16:25,227 --> 01:16:28,378
You mean there's no other way
of contacting them?

269
01:16:28,547 --> 01:16:30,378
Only by rocket (!)

270
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:35,259

- Exactly!
- Even if one could be made operational,

273

for all these...these histrionics.

- How did you even get in here?

278
01:17:03,827 --> 01:17:06,387
The usual way. We just materialised.

279
01:17:06,547 --> 01:17:10,540
The T-Mat cubicle didn't give
automatic warnings this time.

280

281

- Why did you come?
- Well, this is a museum!

282

The museum is... What on earth's that?

283
01:17:18,947 --> 01:17:22,178
It's a 20th-century police box, isn't it?

Well, yes, in a way.

285
01:17:24,507 --> 01:17:26,577
Well, how did it get in my museum?

286
01:17:26,747 --> 01:17:29,659
(ZOE) You could say
it was a form of spaceship.

287

We owe this gentleman an apology.

01:17:32,227 --> 01:17:35,776
We really are most interested
in the museum, Mr, um...?

Eldred. Professor Eldred.

290
01:17:38,107 --> 01:17:42,305
The museum is closed
to the general public. Please leave.

01:17:42,467 --> 01:17:46,142
- Are you in charge of this place?
- I own it! I have the right

292
01:17:46,307 --> 01:17:49,697
- to ask you to leave!
- There's no need to threaten us.

293
01:17:49,867 --> 01:17:53,542
- Trespassers are not welcome!
- We're not trespassers!

294

- We're very interested!
- Interested in these antiquated machines?

295
01:17:58,467 --> 01:18:01,937
Come for a good laugh, I suppose,
like the rest of them!

296
01:18:02,107 --> 01:18:07,465
Laugh?! You mean people laugh at this?
It's a magnificent exhibition!

297

- We've had enough souvenir hunters!
- We're not thieves!

298

We haven't come to take anything!

299
01:18:13,787 --> 01:18:16,745
We genuinely are interested in space travel!

300
01:18:16,907 --> 01:18:19,057
Why, especially a thing like this!

301
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:22,025
- This is superb!
- (ELDRED) Yes, magnificent!

302
01:18:22,187 --> 01:18:25,862
It was to have been the vehicle
to take man beyond the moon.

303
01:18:26,027 --> 01:18:30,498
- T-Mat put an end to all that!
- You mean this model's been abandoned?

304
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:35,343
But its speed and stability are
a tremendous advance in rocket design!

305
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:37,975
Exactly! Here, let me show it to you!

306
01:18:40,907 --> 01:18:43,580
Oh, yes, this is superb. My word!

307
01:18:43,747 --> 01:18:48,104
The real breakthrough was a compact
generator of enormous power!

308
01:18:48,267 --> 01:18:51,896
And these must be the secondary
electrode accelerators.

309
01:18:52,067 --> 01:18:56,902
Yes, you see, it beat the problem
of the neutral caesium ions.

310
01:18:57,067 --> 01:19:00,662
It magnified the G-thrust, too.
Fantastic proportions!

311
01:19:00,827 --> 01:19:02,624
That was awkward!

312
01:19:02,787 --> 01:19:05,540
- What did you do about that?
- I'll show you.

313
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,698
(DOCTOR) What have we got here?

314
01:19:07,867 --> 01:19:10,620
Look at them! They're like a couple of kids!

315
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:13,585
Yeah, he's almost in love with that rocket!

316
01:19:13,747 --> 01:19:16,580
Well, that's not surprising - I designed it!

317
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:18,897
I've been in rocketry all my life.

318
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:22,662
My father engineered
the first lunar passenger module,

319
01:19:22,827 --> 01:19:26,979
and I travelled on the last trip
back to Earth before it finished.

320
01:19:27,147 --> 01:19:29,707
- Before what finished?
- Space travel.

321
01:19:29,867 --> 01:19:33,462
But if the rocket was so good,
why did you stop at the moon?

322
01:19:33,627 --> 01:19:36,061
- Aye, why end there?
- Because of T-Mat.

323
01:19:36,227 --> 01:19:38,297
T-Mat, the ultimate in travel,

324
01:19:38,467 --> 01:19:42,904
with as much sense of adventure
as a synthetic carbohydrates factory!

325
01:19:43,067 --> 01:19:47,538
Surely rockets would still be useful
as an auxiliary means of transport?

326
01:19:47,707 --> 01:19:50,460
Besides, how would man get beyond the moon?

327
01:19:50,627 --> 01:19:53,539
Nobody cares any more about exploring space.

328
01:19:53,707 --> 01:19:57,859
Life's made... Well, it was
made too easy by T-Mat.

329
01:19:58,027 --> 01:20:00,461
I see. So you lost government backing?

330
01:20:00,627 --> 01:20:03,778
The project was abandoned...except by me.

331
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:12,460
You've got to help me! If we don't
repair it, we'll all be killed!

332
01:20:12,627 --> 01:20:15,699
Maybe we could repair it
and T-Mat back to London?

333
01:20:15,867 --> 01:20:19,542
With that thing guarding the door?
I'll keep on trying.

334
01:20:19,707 --> 01:20:22,380
Maybe there is something we can do.

335
01:20:22,547 --> 01:20:24,617
- What?
- I knew you'd see reason!

336
01:20:28,387 --> 01:20:32,266
- What are you doing?!
- The video link with Earth.

337
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:34,816
It's not so badly damaged as the T-Mat.

338
01:20:34,987 --> 01:20:37,501
We're supposed to repair the T-Mat link!

339
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:40,420
Maybe we can get a message through by video.

340
01:20:40,587 --> 01:20:43,704
A guard will see what we're doing!
He'll kill us!

341
01:20:43,867 --> 01:20:47,064
You play your game, we'll play ours.
