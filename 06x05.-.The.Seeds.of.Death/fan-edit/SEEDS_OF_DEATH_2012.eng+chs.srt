You suggest we should psychoanalyse it, Doctor?
你是说我们应该对它进行心里分析吗, 博士？

542
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:38,779
I'm merely suggesting that rather than destroy it,
you should find out its composition and purpose.
我只不过是说, 除了消灭它, 你们应该搞明白它的组成和目的

543
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:41,751
I have some laboratory equipment
in my workshop. You could use that.
我的工作室有一些实验设备, 你可以用

544
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:44,614
- Good. Then we need a sample.
- No problem about that.
- 很好, 然后我们需要一个样本  - 这没问题

I'll get some equipment for you.
我去给你拿些设备

547
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:52,850
Doctor, do be careful. Those pod things are deadly.
博士, 千万小心．那些夹子很致命的

548
00:39:52,921 --> 00:39:56,038
Don't worry. I've already had experience. I'll be careful.
别担心, 我已经有些经验了, 我会小心的

It's alive.
是活的

551
00:40:04,981 --> 00:40:07,814
It's definitely a fungus composition.
这绝对是一种真菌组织

552
00:40:07,981 --> 00:40:11,615
- Are you sure this is correct?
- As far as I can make out, it is.
- 你确定这是对的吗？  - 就我目前的理解, 是的

553
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:15,276
A molecule of five atoms...absorbs oxygen.

You know, a complete blanket of this
你知道吗, 一大片这样的东西

555
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:23,199
would reduce the oxygen content
of the Earth's atmosphere drastically.
就会显著降低地球空气中的氧气浓度

556
00:40:23,261 --> 00:40:26,936
According to my calculations,
to one twentieth normal.
根据我的计算, 会降到 5% 的水平

557
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:30,299
It would make the Earth's atmosphere
uninhabitable to the human race,
这会使得地球的大气不再适合人类居住

558
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,680
but exactly like the atmosphere of Mars!
而是变得跟火星的大气一模一样！

Look at that. Even without vegetation
to feed on, it's still active. Oh!
看这个, 即使不蚕食植物, 它还是活着的．噢！

the fumes will kill us! Come on, Doctor!
如果那个东西在这里爆炸, 那种烟会杀死我们的！快闪, 博士！

Well, what was it? What did you throw on it?
哦, 那是什么？你倒了什么东西上去？

567
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:21,451
- You really think it would work?
- Well It could be less effective than Moonbase, of course.
- 你真的觉得这能行？  - 它可能没有月球基地那么有效, 这也是当然的

568
00:41:21,621 --> 00:41:24,419
which handles up to two million microwave channels simultaneously,
月球基地可以同时支持二百万的微波通道

569
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:26,675
the satellite would just take a few thousand.
而卫星只能支持几千

570
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:28,791
That would be enough for vital food supplies.
用来传送重要食物供应那也够了

But we can't use normal communications satellites.
They are not programmed for T-Mat.
但我们不能使用普通的通讯卫星啊, 它们不是为 T-Mat 准备的

572
00:41:32,581 --> 00:41:34,474
No. We have to send up a specially programmed one.
的确不是, 我们得单独发射一颗, 经过特殊编程的

573
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,151
That would mean using a rocket, wouldn't it?
I thought no one use them nowadays.
但那意味着要使用火箭, 对不对？我记得现在都没人使用了？

574
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:40,814
Not manned rockets, but we do send up satellites for communications.
是没有载人火箭, 但我们还是会用它发射通讯卫星

575
00:41:40,981 --> 00:41:44,796

- Well, I don't know. If we're given top priority...
- 多久你们能搞一个上天？  - 嗯, 我不知道．如果我们被授予最高优先级...
