00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:08,645
DOCTOR: Well, that's it, then.

4
00:01:08,727 --> 00:01:10,558
Come on, we've landed.

5
00:01:11,807 --> 00:01:13,923
Oh, hadn't we better wake our cellmate?

6
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,680
(CHUCKLING) He's awake already.

7
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:18,723
He's just trying to show us
how unconcerned he is.

(MASTER LAUGHING)

9
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,400
How well you know me, Doctor!

10
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:25,205
Now, come on, smarten yourselves up.

11
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:27,721
We want to look our best
for a royal audience, you know.

12
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:29,559
He's very confident.

13
00:01:29,647 --> 00:01:32,639
Well, Miss Grant,
as an Earth poet once said,

14
00:01:32,727 --> 00:01:36,037
"My strength is as the strength of ten,
because my heart is pure."

15
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:40,279
Come on, you fellows, let me out.
Your Emperor is waiting to see me.

16
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:56,356
So, Father, once more
Earthmen have invaded our space.

17
00:01:56,447 --> 00:02:00,156
You will address the Emperor
in a proper manner.

18
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:01,396
Your pardon.

19
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:04,445
May I have permission
to address the Emperor?

20
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:08,925
My life at your command.

21
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:12,716
One day, my Son,
you will inherit this throne.

22
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:16,800
Then you will realise
the importance of due formality.

23
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,685
Now, what do you wish to say?

24
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:23,203
Surely, now you will declare war
upon the Earthmen?

25
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:25,437
Let me lead your battle fleets
to crush their...

26
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:28,087
They too, have battle fleets, my Son.

27
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:31,000
Such a war could
well bring down both empires.

28
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:34,238
Not if we strike first,
then we shall be the victors!

29
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:37,763
In such a war, there are no victors.

30
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:40,600
The nobles of the court
are demanding action.

31
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:42,678
They fear for the honour of Draconia.

32
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:48,205
I am the emperor!
The honour of Draconia is vested in me.

33
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:52,200
The throne depends upon
the great families for support.

34
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:55,006
Emperors have been deposed before now.

35
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:58,841
An emperor who does not rule
deposes himself!

36
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:01,798
Then what will you do, Father?

37
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:04,845
I shall question these Earthmen myself.

38
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:06,963
I have already sent for them.

39
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:09,720
Why waste time listening to their lies?

40
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:19,364
Majesty, I bring the prisoners.

41
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,965
May I have permission
to address the Emperor?

42
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:24,476
Wait!

43
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:26,285
This is an insult!

44
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,803
My life at your command, sire.

45
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:33,445
How dare you address the Emperor

46
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:35,597
in a manner reserved
for a noble of Draconia?

47
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:37,882
Ah, but I am a noble of Draconia.

48
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,197
The honour was conferred on me
by the 15th Emperor.

49
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:44,439
The 15th Emperor reigned 500 years ago.

(LAUGHING)

51
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:50,158
Your Majesty, do not be taken
in by this ridiculous story...

52
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:51,760
Be silent!

53
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:54,399
There is a legend
among our people of a man

54
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:57,718
who assisted the 15th Emperor
at a time of great trouble

55
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:03,165
when we were almost overwhelmed
by a great plague from outer space.

56
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:08,844
But you could not be that man.
No Earthman lives so long.

57
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:11,487
Your Majesty,
this man that you speak of,

58
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,444
was he not known as the Doctor?

59
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:17,438
And did he not come to this planet
in a spaceship called the TARDIS?

60
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:18,846
He did.

61
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:20,963
Well, I am that man, sire.

62
00:04:21,487 --> 00:04:24,684
And I come from a race of people
that live far longer than any Earthman.

63
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:28,362
Even if I accept your claim,
you have broken our law.

64
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:31,837
Why did you violate Draconian space?

65
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:35,078
Your Majesty, this man was,
and still is, my prisoner.

66
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:36,839
It is true, Your Majesty.

67
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:40,158
I did come here as a prisoner,
but I came willingly,

68
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,363
in order to inform you that
this man is plotting a war

69
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:43,721
between Earth and Draconia!

70
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:45,957
All Earthmen are determined upon war.

71
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:48,607
Ah, but the Master is not an Earthman.

72
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:51,838
I'm sorry to have to admit it,
but he's a renegade of my own race

73
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:54,521
and he's using creatures called Ogrons

74
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:56,802
to attack your spaceships
and those of the Earthmen.

75
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:59,720
The Earthmen who attacked
our spaceships,

76
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:01,843
they have been seen many times.

77
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,918
I'm sorry,
but there you are in error, sir.

78
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:05,918
Your people have seen Ogrons,

79
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:08,999
but they appear to them as Earthmen
because of a hypnotic device.

80
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:10,645
It's true, Your Majesty.

81
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,797
When the Ogrons attacked
the Earth ships,

82
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:15,037
the Earthmen saw them as Draconians.

83
00:05:15,127 --> 00:05:18,483
Silence! Females are not permitted
to speak in the presence of the Emperor.

84
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:22,446
Your Majesty, do not be deceived
by the pathetic ravings

85
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:24,802
of two criminals
trying to evade justice.

86
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:28,641
If what you say is true,
it would explain much.

87
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:31,287
We lived at peace with the Earthmen
for many years,

88
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:34,404
then suddenly they began
to raid our spaceships.

89
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:37,843
When we protested,
they said that we were attacking them.

90
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:39,883
In order to cover up their own attacks!

91
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:44,245
This is simply a plot of the Earthmen
to lull us into false security.

92
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,196
Speak!

93
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,518
Your Majesty, a spaceship from Earth

94
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:53,201
seeks permission to land
in the palace spaceport.

95
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:56,438
They say they're on a special mission
from the President of Earth.

96
00:05:56,527 --> 00:05:58,563
This is a trick!
You must not allow them to land!

97
00:05:58,647 --> 00:06:00,922
We are not yet at war with Earth.

98
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:04,079
I shall hear what
their president has to say.

99
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:05,725
I give my permission.

100
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:07,240
Your Majesty.

101
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:09,363
A wise decision, Your Majesty.

102
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:11,278
For only by Earth and Draconia
working together

103
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:13,358
can we hope to arrive at the truth.

104
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:15,836
I, too, welcome your wisdom,
Your Majesty.

105
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:19,044
Nobody could be more devoted
to the cause of peace than I.

106
00:06:19,127 --> 00:06:21,243
As a commissioner of Earth's
Interplanetary Police,

107
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:24,524
I have devoted my life
to the cause of law and order.

108
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:27,644
And law and order can only exist
in a time of peace.

109
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:29,877
You feeling all right, old chap?

110
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:32,686
Only during a period
of social stability,

111
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,600
can society adequately
deal with criminals

112
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,279
such as this man
and this unfortunate girl.

that I heard on the cargo ship.

Doctor, it's the Ogrons!

Your Majesty,
I beg of you to be cautious.

120

Something is seriously wrong here.
This ship that has just landed,

121

I beg you,
place it under guard immediately.

in the treachery of the Earthmen?

Great, lumbering idiots!

one of your fellows in the palace!

As soon as the effect
of the hypno-sound wears off,

144

the Draconians will know
who it really was who attacked them.

145
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:11,716
You've ruined everything!

146
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:13,286
What shall we do now?

147
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,962
Do? There's only one thing we can do.

148
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:19,242
Make sure that the Doctor
and his evidence

is never allowed to reach Earth.

150
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:29,477
Why does the Master want war
between Earth and Draconia?

151
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:32,843
Did you attack our spaceships
and those of the Earthmen?

Oh, it's no good.

He will answer to me.

I shall use the mind probe.

155
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:41,557
You'd only be wasting your time.

156
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,525
The Ogrons have got the finest
defence mechanism of all, stupidity.

157
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,756
They haven't got a mind
for you to probe.

158
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:49,203
Then remove him.
We will deal with him later.

00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:57,042
Why did that sound make us see
this creature as a soldier from Earth?

160
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:58,958
Because you're frightened of Earthmen.

161
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:01,242
Draconians fear nothing, female.

162
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:05,479
Well, of course you do.
You fear them and they fear you.

163
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:08,718
That's why when Earthmen
heard that sound, they saw Draconians.

164
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:10,081
That is true.

165
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:15,287
We do fear the Earthmen
and they fear us.

166
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:17,801
And fear breeds hatred, Your Majesty.

167
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:21,197
Fear is the greatest enemy of them all,
for fear leads us to war.

168
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:24,438
We shall tell the Earthmen
what has happened here.

169
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:26,358
They, too, must know the truth.

170
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:28,085
They will not believe us.

171
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,805
The Prince is right, Your Majesty.

172
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:32,959
We must mount an expedition at once
and we must take the Ogron as evidence.

173
00:09:33,047 --> 00:09:35,197
The empires are on the verge of war.

174
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:37,198
A Draconian spaceship in Earth space

175
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:40,723
could be destroyed before it
reaches its destination.

176
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:42,763
We could use the ship
the Master brought us in.

177
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:44,166
It's an Earth police spaceship.

178
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:46,283
Females are not permitted to speak...

179
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:47,766
The female may speak.

180
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:50,077
-But...
-We must respect

181
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:53,796
the customs of our guests,
strange though they may be.

182
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,798
The suggestion had merit.

183
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,684
Thank you, Your Majesty.

184
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,837
You too, will go on this mission.

185
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:02,646
But it must be headed
by a Draconian of noble rank.

186
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,877
I shall send my son.

187
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:22,515
Here you are. Brought you some food.

188
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:24,518
And a delicious banana.

189
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:30,318
I think you're supposed
to peel it first.

190
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,125
Oh, well.

191
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:37,120
Hey, you know,
you wanna be very careful of him.

192
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:39,482
He's not as stupid as he looks.

193
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:45,002
(SIGHING) I know, I know,
women aren't allowed to speak.

194
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:50,445
You know, I think it's about time that
women's lib was brought to Draconia.

195
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:02,518
Hello, Jo. How's your Ogron friend?

196
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:06,361
Not too happy.
He seemed to enjoy his banana, though.

197
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:08,119
Doctor, where are we?

198
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:10,596
We're just about to cross
the frontier into Earth space.

199
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:12,166
Ooh, that's good.

200
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:14,761
Unless your Earth people destroy us.

201
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:17,077
Well, this is an Earth police spaceship,
you know, sir.

202
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:19,078
Even if it is stolen.

203
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,397
What is that?

204
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:23,637
DOCTOR: It looks like another spaceship.

205
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:25,957
It appears to be following us.

206
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:33,360
OGRON: Look!

207
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:36,964
MASTER: Well, that must be them.

208
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:39,515
No other ship would be on a course
for Earth at a time like this.

209
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:41,279
We are on a course for Earth!

210
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,835
Well, naturally,
because we're chasing them...

211
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:44,962
(SIGHING IN EXASPERATION)

212
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:47,197
Keep quiet and let me think!

213
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:50,321
Now, soon they'll be
within striking distance.

214
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:52,841
What will you do, Master?

215
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:56,158
I'd like to try and take
the Doctor alive, if possible.

216
00:11:56,247 --> 00:12:01,002
If not, I'll blast him out of space.
Pity, though.

217
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,725
You do not wish to kill him?

218
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:04,638
Of course, I do!

219
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:09,596
But I don't know,
rocket fire at long range, it's...

220
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,963
I don't know,
somehow it lacks that personal touch.

221
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:16,118
They're closing in.

222
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:18,880
Perhaps, it's a frontier patrol ship
coming to investigate us.

223
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:21,276
Well, can't we talk to them
and tell them who we are?

224
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:24,279
We can try.
We should be within audio range.

00:12:46,527 --> 00:12:49,837
your ship is one that

in trouble over this.

Why should we submit to this delay?
Our mission has diplomatic immunity.

Yes, but they unfortunately
didn't know that, did they?

Hello, Earth police spaceship,

we are reducing speed as you request.
Over.

242
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:17,675
Doctor, are you sure?
We don't really know if it's the police.

243
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:21,396
Yes, exactly. That's why I want
to get them into visual scanner range.

244
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,526
Right, they've reduced speed.

245
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:28,679
They should be within
striking distance now.

That's about it.
Release the first missile!

No. No, I'm afraid we're outgunned.

<i>is escaping in that vessel.</i>

315
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:36,922
CAPTAIN: <i>You are under arrest.</i>

316
00:17:37,007 --> 00:17:39,760
<i>You'll be given the opportunity</i>
<i>of making a full statement.</i>

317
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:43,123
<i>Do not offer any resistance.</i>
<i>Stand by to be boarded.</i>

318
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:46,040
DOCTOR: <i>Oh, very well.</i>
<i>We're standing by.</i>

319
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:47,242
(LAUGHING)

320
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:51,957
Poor Doctor.
Enmeshed in the throes of bureaucracy.

321
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:53,116
(LAUGHING)

322
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:55,562
It'll take him a long time
to talk himself out of that one.

323
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:58,161
But he'll get to see the President,
eventually.

324
00:17:58,247 --> 00:17:59,282
She won't believe him.

325
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:02,757
Oh, yes, she will,
when she sees the Ogron prisoner.

326
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:04,519
He's our evidence.

327
00:18:06,247 --> 00:18:09,125
Your evidence is standing
right behind you.

328
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:15,476
The Draconian Prince knows
the truth and he's with the Doctor.

329
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:20,004
My dear, Miss Grant, in the climate
of opinion that I have created,

330
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:21,566
do you think that any Earthman

331
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,683
is going to believe the word
of a Draconian?

332
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:28,443
Your Highness,
we've heard the Doctor's theory before.

333
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:32,236
And, with respect,
there is still no concrete evidence.

334
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:34,636
I myself would like to believe you
but, as you can see,

335
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:36,797
I need proof to convince my people.

336
00:18:36,887 --> 00:18:39,117
Then we must mount an expedition
to the planet of the Ogrons.

337
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:40,356
The proof we need is there, madam.

338
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:42,563
With Earth on the brink of war,
how can we divert our forces

339
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:44,717
into such a pointless expedition?

340
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:48,117
Suppose this is yet another
Draconian trick to divide our strength?

341
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:50,846
My dear chap,
I'm not asking for a battle fleet.

342
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:53,157
All I require is one small spaceship.

343
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:54,680
Your request is granted.

344
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,246
On the contrary, your request is denied.

345
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:57,362
My authority...

346
00:18:57,447 --> 00:18:59,119
WILLIAMS: In a purely military
matter of this kind, madam,

347
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:00,560
your authority is limited.

348
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:02,524
I can overrule you.

349
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,643
Only with the backing
of the full Earth senate.

350
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,195
And do you think they will give it?

351
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:10,958
How can we expect help
from a man such as this?

352
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:14,084
This is the man who deliberately
caused war between our people!

353
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:15,361
That is untrue!

354
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,883
Twenty years ago,
you destroyed a Draconian ship

355
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:20,685
that had come in a mission of peace.

356
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:24,123
A ship that was about to open fire on us
when we were damaged and helpless.

357
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:27,358
They came in peace,
as had been arranged.

358
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:29,915
Then why didn't they answer my signals?

359
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:33,886
Their communications equipment
had been destroyed in a neutron storm.

360
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:37,277
The same neutron storm
that damaged your ship!

361
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:38,800
Is this true?

362
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,526
I have read the records
of my father's court.

363
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:43,199
It is the truth.

364
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,564
But why a battle cruiser?

365
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:47,717
The agreement was that both ships
were to be unarmed.

366
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:49,877
Naturally, we sent a cruiser.

367
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:52,720
How else should a nobleman
of Draconia travel?

368
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:58,086
But its missile banks were empty,
the ship was unarmed.

369
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:04,236
Well, very soon we shall be landing.

370
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:08,115
I think, Miss Grant, you had better
prepare yourself for a long stay.

371
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,323
I'm afraid it's not
a very comfortable place,

372
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:12,079
but as the old song says,

373
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:15,318
"Be it ever so humble,
there's no place like home."

374
00:20:15,727 --> 00:20:17,479
Your Highness,

375
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:21,719
please accept my deepest regrets
for the wrong I have done your people.

376
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:25,516
Then, can I take it, sir, that you will
now authorise the expedition?

377
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:27,563
I intend to lead it.

378
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:31,003
If the planet of the Ogrons exists,
we shall find it.

379
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:39,684
Be careful down here.

380
00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:44,521
This way.

381
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:52,879
Right, in there.

382
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:16,115
Well, Miss Grant,
welcome to my humble abode.

383
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:17,720
I think you were better off in prison.

384
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:18,956
Oh, temporary quarters, my dear.

385
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:21,436
I shall soon be changing them
for something better.

386
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:23,324
Oh, you'll soon be back in jail.

387
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,442
When the truth gets out,

388
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:27,280
Earth and Draconia will combine
their forces to attack you.

389
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:30,803
I don't think so.
There's too much distrust between them.

390
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:32,445
The Doctor will find you, eventually.

391
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:36,042
Ah, there I agree with you.
He must find me.

392
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:38,766
Not only to rescue you,

393
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:42,965
but also to be reunited
with his beloved TARDIS.

394
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:49,646
You know, Miss Grant,
I'm going to set a trap for the Doctor.

395
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:52,803
And you are going to help me.

396
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:54,036
What?

397
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:59,164
No noble speeches to the effect that
you'd rather die than betray the Doctor?

398
00:21:59,247 --> 00:22:01,715
You know I'm not going to help you.

399
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:05,117
I know that you are.

400
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:11,801
I know that you will obey me.

401
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:18,358
You will obey me! I am the Master...

402
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:20,677
"Mary had a little lamb,
his fleece was white as snow,

403
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:21,882
"and everywhere that Mary went,

404
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:23,161
-"the lamb was sure to go."
-You will obey me...

405
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:25,522
"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall..."

406
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:26,960
Stop that, Miss Grant!

407
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:28,116
It's a form of self-conditioning.

408
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:31,005
You fill your mind with nonsense
and then you can't be hypnotised.

409
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:32,361
-"See-saw, Margery Daw...
-You will obey me.

410
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:33,641
"Johnny shall have a new master.

411
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,955
-"He shall have but a penny a day...
-You will...

412
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:36,366
-"Because he can't work any faster..."
-Obey me!

413
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:39,280
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

414
00:22:39,527 --> 00:22:42,121
I was never very fond
of nursery rhymes anyhow!

415
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:45,358
Then you'll just have to give up
all hope of hypnotising me, won't you?

416
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,802
Once was quite enough, thank you.

417
00:22:47,887 --> 00:22:48,956
Hmm.

418
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:55,838
In that case,
I shall have to try something else.

419
00:22:57,567 --> 00:23:00,081
You may have heard this
noise before, Miss Grant.

420
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:01,885
(HYPNOTIC PULSE SOUNDING)

421
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:06,677
It works directly on the fear centres
deep in your mind!
