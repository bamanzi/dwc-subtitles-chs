你们种族的名声是众所周知的, 殿下

00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:48,557
You attack our ships, you steal their cargoes,
你们攻击我们的船, 你们抢走他们的货物

148
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:52,162
you ignore our protests and just meet them with these counter-charges.

Your general is insolent.

We know the hatred he has always felt for our people.

170
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:14,316
Long ago he caused war.

178
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:40,605
then this is not the way to deal with them.
这也并不是处理问题的正确做法

Many of our noblemen felt it was a mistake
to make a treaty with the Earthmen.

Doctor, what's happening on this ship?
博士, 这艘船现在怎么了?

190
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:29,723
Are they both mad or am I? First I see a Drashig and...
是他们都疯了, 还是我疯了? 先是我看到了一个怪物...

00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:33,322
No, you can put that away. Bolts.
不, 你可以不用去想那个了.fixme

192
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:36,285
And why do they keep calling us Dragons?
为什么他们一直把我们叫做龙?

193
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:37,880
Well, that's the way they see us, I suppose.
哦, 那应该是他们眼中我们的样子, 我猜测

194
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:39,719
Yes, but why Dragons?
哦, 但为什么是龙?

195
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:42,879
It's got to be some non-human life form.
肯定是某种跟人不一样的生命形式

196
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:48,678

- Yes, of course. Draconians. - What?
- 对, 当然了, 龙族人 - 什么?

198
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:54,846
Well, if this is the period that I think it is,
there are two great empires
这样, 这就是我猜测的那段时间, 有两个大帝国

199
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:56,645
spreading their way through the galaxy of the Milky Way.
把他们的版图扩大到了整个银河系

200
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:58,080
Empires? You mean like Solos?
帝国? 你是说 Solos 那个?

200
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:02,080
<i>Jo 说的 Solos 是指第9季第3个故事 The Mutants 中的一个星球</i>
<i>该故事发生在30世纪的地球帝国时期</i>

201
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,237
Those were the declining years of Earth's planetary empire,
那是地球帝国的衰败期

202
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:01,999
this is just the beginning.
而这还在刚兴起的时候

203
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,157
Now, Earth and Draconia are both been expanding, you see.
现在, 地球和龙族都在扩大版图, 你看

and they're sitting on a powder keg.
殖民一个又一个星球, 他们就坐到了火药桶上

205
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:09,477
Yes, but why do they mistake us for these Dragons?
这样啊, 那他们h为什么会把我们错当成龙

206
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:12,843
No, Draconians. No, Dragons is rather an unflattering nickname.
不, 是"龙族人", "龙"只是一个不讨好的绰号

207
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,122
Well, you remember that sound you heard?
对了, 你还记得你听到的那个声音吗?

208
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:17,118
- Yes. - And the man that you saw with the gun?
- 是的 - 你看到的那个人带着枪?

209
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:19,721
Oh, no. No, no, what I saw was a Drashig.
哦, 没有, 没有. 我看到的是一个怪物

210
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:23,720
No, you didn't, Jo. That sound made you see what you fear most.
不, 你没有. Jo, 那个声音让你看到你最害怕的东西

- How? - Well, it shouldn't be too difficult.
- 怎么可能? - 哦, 应该也不是太难

- 差不多就可以主动哦傲 - 可以维持多久?

00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:33,525
How long before they see that we're just people?
多久以后他们才能看清我们只是人类?

215
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:35,518
Well, difficult to say.
这个, 不太好错

216
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:38,599
It seems to act like a, sort of post-hypnotic command.
看起来有点像是某种深度催眠

217
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:41,679
It will fade eventually, of course.
但最终会消退的, 当然了

(SIGHING) Why should anybody go to all this trouble
to make people see things?

219
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:47,717
- Why indeed?
- 对啊, 为什么?

220
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:52,080
Well, we've got to get out of here somehow.
我们还是先得想个办法跑出去

221
00:12:58,447 --> 00:12:59,960
- Doctor! - Hmm?
- 博士!  - 嗯?

222
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:04,160
- I can see the TARDIS. - Well, that's one consolation, isn't it?
- 我可以看到 TARDIS - 啊, 总算有点让人欣慰的事情, 对吧

223
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:08,559

好吧, 也许第一次的信息传过去了, 他们会派人来帮忙的

会吗? 他们很可能只是相互传递一下备忘录

- 他们会派人来帮忙的 - 我可知道他们会怎么做

他们会向龙族大使馆递交一份抗议书

230
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:28,759
By that time, we'll be finished.
到那个时候, 我们早就完了

Do you have a better idea?
你有更好的主意吗?

- 只不过是一堆面粉罢了 - 但这是我运的货啊

00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,842
And if the Draconians want it,
但如果龙族人想拿走
