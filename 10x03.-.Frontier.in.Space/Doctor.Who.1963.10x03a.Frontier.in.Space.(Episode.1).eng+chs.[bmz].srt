We have captured two of your soldiers.

135
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:51,717
They will not survive if you enter our ship.
如果你们登入我们的船, 他们的命就不保了

136
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,763
- Lock them in the hold. - Move!

144
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:23,687
But all these charges are false, Your Highness.
这些指控都是假的, 殿下

145
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,163
We are not attacking Draconian ships. We never have!

Our soldiers have seen the Earthmen attack us.

Our cargos have been stolen.

We are Draconians, we do not lie.

149
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:39,766
The honour of your race is well known, Your Highness.
你们种族的名声是众所周知的, 殿下

150
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:41,838
That is why I cannot understand your actions.
这也是为什么我弄不明白你们的行动

151
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:43,076
Actions?
行动?

152
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:46,557
You attack our ships, you steal their cargoes,
你们攻击我们的船, 你们抢走他们的货物

153
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:50,162
you ignore our protests
and just meet them with these counter-charges.
你忽略我们的抗议, 只是那这些反诉来应对

Our charges are true but yours are false.

We do not attack your ships.

156
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:02,320
This is a transcript of a distress call from one of our ships.
这是有记录, 抄录自我们一艘船说发出的求救信号

"We are under attack by a Draconian battle cruiser,
我们正被一艘龙族战斗巡航舰攻击

00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:15,116
"galaxy class, equipped with neutronic missiles."
星系级, 配备有中子导弹

160
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:20,406
The treaty between our two empires established a frontier in space.
我们两个帝国通过协商建立了一个太空边界

161
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:23,285
We have never violated that frontier.

162
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:26,996
You have invaded our part of the galaxy many times.
但你们已经数次入侵我们星系

163
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:30,079
In pursuit of your ships when they have raided ours!
FIXME

164
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:32,957
We've been very patient, perhaps too patient.
我们一直很有耐性, 也许是太有耐性了

165
00:09:33,047 --> 00:09:34,685
General Williams!
Williams 将军!

166
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:37,678
I take it a rescue attempt has been mounted?
我认为已经在安排营救了吧?

167
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:39,803
We've established an automatic procedure,
我们已经一套自动化过程

168
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:42,276
because of the frequency of these attacks.
因为这种攻击已经变得很频繁了

169
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:45,040
Then I suggest you go and supervise the matter.

170
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,446
There's no need.
这并没有必要

171
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,442
Please do as I say.
请按我说的做

172
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,596
As you wish, Madam President.
听您的吩咐, 总统夫人

173
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:06,037
Your general is insolent.
你的将军太无礼了

174
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:09,915
We know the hatred he has always felt for our people.
我们都知道他一直都对我们种族怀着仇恨

175
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:12,316
Long ago he caused war.
很久以前他挑起了战争

176
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:14,875
Now he wishes to do so again.

177
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:18,164
He's a soldier, Your Highness, and he's angry.
他是个战士, 殿下, 而且他很愤怒

178
00:10:18,887 --> 00:10:21,606
The people of Earth are angry.
地球人都很愤怒

179
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:25,316
So are the nobles of my father's court!
我父亲的王廷上那些贵族也一样!

180
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:29,281
I must ask you to take my personal appeal to your father, the Emperor.
我必须得让你把我个人的呼吁带给你父皇

181
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,837
He must put a stop to these attacks.
他必须叫停这些攻击

182
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:35,725
If Draconia has some grievances against Earth,
如果龙族对地球有什么不满

183
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:38,605
then this is not the way to deal with them.
这也并不是处理问题的正确做法

184
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,843
Many of our noblemen felt it was a mistake
to make a treaty with the Earthmen.
我们贵族中的许多人认为跟地球人缔结条约是一个错误

185
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:48,001
Perhaps they were right.
也许他们是对的

186
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:51,363
You attack our ships and when we protest
你们攻击了我们的飞船, 当我们提出抗议的时候

187
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:54,519
you trick us with lies and evasions.
你们又用谎言和否认来欺骗我们

188
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:57,646
I give you a final warning.
我给你们最后的警告

189
00:10:57,727 --> 00:11:01,117
The path you are treading leads only to war.
你们走的这条路只会通向战争

190
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:06,076
And in that war, Draconia will destroy you!
而在这场战争里, 龙族人会摧毁你们

191
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:13,278
In there.
进去

192
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:15,923
- DOCTOR: Look... - In there!
- 你看... - 进去!

193
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:22,967
Doctor, what's happening on this ship?
博士, 这艘船现在怎么了?

194
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:27,723
Are they both mad or am I? First I see a Drashig and...
是他们都疯了, 还是我疯了? 先是我看到了一个 Drashig ...

195
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:31,322
No, you can put that away. Bolts.
不, 你可以不用去想那个了

196
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:34,285
And why do they keep calling us Dragons?
为什么他们一直把我们叫做龙?

197
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:35,880
Well, that's the way they see us, I suppose.
哦, 那应该是他们眼中我们的样子, 我猜测

198
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,719
Yes, but why Dragons?
哦, 但为什么是龙?

199
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:40,879
It's got to be some non-human life form.
肯定是某种跟人不一样的生命形式

200
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:46,678
Something that they're frightened of. Dragons... Dragons.
某种他们很害怕的东西, 龙...龙...

201
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,118
- Yes, of course. Draconians. - What?
- 对, 当然了, 龙族人 - 什么?

202
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:52,846
Well, if this is the period that I think it is,
there are two great empires
这样, 这就是我猜测的那段时间, 有两个大帝国

203
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:54,645
spreading their way through the galaxy of the Milky Way.
把他们的版图扩大到了整个银河系

204
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:56,080
Empires? You mean like Solos?
帝国? 你是说 Solos 那个?

205
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:00,080
<i>Jo 说的 Solos 是指第9季第3个故事 The Mutants 中的一个星球</i>
<i>该故事发生在30世纪的地球帝国时期</i>

206
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:58,237
Those were the declining years of Earth's planetary empire,
那是地球帝国的衰败期

207
00:11:58,327 --> 00:11:59,999
this is just the beginning.
而这还在刚兴起的时候

208
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,157
Now, Earth and Draconia are both been expanding, you see.
现在, 地球和龙族都在扩大版图, 你看

209
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:05,319
Colonising one planet after another,
and they're sitting on a powder keg.
殖民一个又一个星球, 他们就坐到了火药桶上

210
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:07,477
Yes, but why do they mistake us for these Dragons?
这样啊, 那他们h为什么会把我们错当成龙

211
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:10,843
No, Draconians. No, Dragons is rather an unflattering nickname.
不, 是"龙族人", "龙"只是一个不讨好的绰号

212
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:13,122
Well, you remember that sound you heard?
对了, 你还记得你听到的那个声音吗?

213
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:15,118
- Yes. - And the man that you saw with the gun?
- 是的 - 你看到的那个人带着枪?

214
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:17,721
Oh, no. No, no, what I saw was a Drashig.
哦, 没有, 没有. 我看到的是一个 Drashig

215
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:21,720
No, you didn't, Jo. That sound made you see what you fear most.
不, 你没有. Jo, 那个声音让你看到你最害怕的东西

216
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:24,077
- How? - Well, it shouldn't be too difficult.
- 怎么可能? - 哦, 应该也不是太难

217
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:27,079
Ultrasonics geared to stimulate the fear centres of the brain,
用超声波刺激大脑中的恐惧中心

218
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,727
- something like that. - How long does it last?
- 差不多那样的东西 - 可以维持多久?

219
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:31,525
How long before they see that we're just people?
多久以后他们才能看清我们只是人类?

220
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:33,518
Well, difficult to say.
这个, 不太好错

221
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:36,599
It seems to act like a, sort of post-hypnotic command.
看起来有点像是某种深度催眠

222
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:39,679
It will fade eventually, of course.
但最终会消退的, 当然了

223
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:44,756
(SIGHING) Why should anybody go to all this trouble
to make people see things?
为什么会有人会如此费劲地让别人看到其它的东西?

224
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,817
- Why indeed?
- 对啊, 为什么?

225
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:50,080
Well, we've got to get out of here somehow.
我们还是先得想个办法跑出去

226
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,960
- Doctor! - Hmm?
- 博士!  - 嗯?

227
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:02,160
- I can see the TARDIS. - Well, that's one consolation, isn't it?
- 我可以看到 TARDIS - 啊, 总算有点让人欣慰的事情, 对吧

228
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:06,559
- Try Earth Control again. - Emergency, emergency, red alert.
- 再联系一下地球控制中心 - 紧急情况, 紧急情况, 红色警报

229
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:12,961
This is Earth cargo ship C982 on coordinate 8972/6483.
这里是地球货船C982, 坐标 8972/6483

230
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:15,038
Ah! They're jamming us.
啊, 我们被屏蔽了

231
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,641
Well, maybe the first message got through. They'll send help.
好吧, 也许第一次的信息传过去了, 他们会派人来帮忙的

232
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:20,480
Will they? They're probably still passing memos to each other.
会吗? 他们很可能只是相互传递一下备忘录

233
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,001
- They'll send help. - I know what they'll do.
- 他们会派人来帮忙的 - 我可知道他们会怎么做

234
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:24,998
They'll send a note of protest to the Draconian Embassy.
他们会向龙族大使馆递交一份抗议书

235
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:26,759
By that time, we'll be finished.
到那个时候, 我们早就完了

236
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,236
The Government should have blown the blighters out of space years ago.
政府早就应该把那些讨厌的家伙炸出太空去

237
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:31,045
- And have another war? - What do you think this is?
- 又来一场战争? - 你觉得现在是什么?

238
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:34,437
Look, the door of our space lock is 99% durilium.
我们的减压舱门可是 99% 的硬铝合金

239
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,324
They're not going to get through that in a hurry.
他们一时半会没法弄穿它

240
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:41,242
DRACONIAN COMMANDER: <i>Earth men, this is your last warning.</i>
地球人, 这是对你们最后的警告

241
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:46,084
<i>Surrender your cargo, and you will be unharmed.</i>
交出你们的货物, 你们就会平安无事

242
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:50,479
<i>Resist and you will be destroyed.</i>
如果反抗, 你们就会被消灭

243
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:53,840
Right. Looks like battle stations.
We'd better get down to the airlock.
好吧, 看来是个硬茬, 我们最好到减压舱那里去

244
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:55,519
- You're not going to fight them? - If I have to.
- 你们不打算跟他们斗吧? - 别逼我太甚

245
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:56,835
Do you have a better idea?
你有更好的主意吗?

246
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:59,725
- It's only a load of flour! - It's my cargo.
- 只不过是一堆面粉罢了 - 但这是我运的货啊

247
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:00,842
And if the Draconians want it,
但如果龙族人想拿走

248
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:03,964
it's going to cost them more than just a few threats.
不可能就凭几句话吧, 怎么也得付出点代价

249
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:13,399
<i>And the Bureau of Population Control announced today</i>
人口控制总局今日宣布

250
