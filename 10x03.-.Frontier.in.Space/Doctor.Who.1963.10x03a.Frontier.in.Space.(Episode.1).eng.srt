(DOCTOR WHO THEME)

2
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:51,603
HARDY: This is Earth cargo ship C982
on course and on schedule.

3
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:55,362
We shall be entering hyperspace
in 50 seconds.

4
00:00:55,447 --> 00:00:57,597
(COUNTER CLICKING)

5

(SIGHING)

6
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:02,963
-You know what I'd like?
-What?

7
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:05,561
Job on one of those luxury space liners.

8
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:08,036
First Officer on the Mars-Venus cruise,
that'd suit me.

9
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:09,685
(CHUCKLING) You can keep it.

10
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:12,804
Spit and polish, cocktail parties
and all those passengers?

11
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:15,401
Gold braid uniform,
beautiful stewardesses?

12
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:17,523
Yeah, I'd take that anytime.

13
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:20,326
You'll more likely wind up
pushing a battle cruiser.

14
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:22,557
There's not going to be
an interplanetary war.

15
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:25,241
Didn't you see the videocast last night?

16
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:26,885
The president of the Earth's government

17
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:30,039
deplores the Draconian attack
on two of Earth's cargo vessels.

18
00:01:30,127 --> 00:01:34,917
Look, they steal a few of our cargoes,
we steal a few of theirs.

19
00:01:35,047 --> 00:01:37,083
It'll all blow over.

20
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:40,045
Right. We're ready for the jump.

21
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:47,876
Preparing to enter hyperspace at
22-09-72, 2540 ESP.

22
00:01:48,647 --> 00:01:50,683
-Right.
-Right.

23
00:01:58,847 --> 00:02:00,997
Hey, look. A ship.

24
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:05,000
-STEWART: That thing's not a ship.
-It's gonna hit us.

25
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:09,638
Pulling out of hyperspace now
in 22-13-7-2-7-2-4-0.

26
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:14,358
Phew! That was a close thing.

27
00:02:14,447 --> 00:02:18,759
-HARDY: It vanished, it just vanished.
-You'd better report it.

28
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:22,245
Mysterious object sighted
during hyperspace transition.

29
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:25,080
Object resembles a large box
with flashing light on top.

30
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:26,998
Object disappeared before collision.

31
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:29,043
Present whereabouts unknown.

32
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:30,685
(SIGHING)

33
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:40,516
Well, I'm never going
in that thing again.

34
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:42,757
Oh, come on, Jo, be reasonable.

35
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:45,998
Only you could manage to have
a traffic accident in space.

36
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:48,885
-Well, we didn't hit it, did we?
-Didn't we? Where's this then?

37
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,878
Well, by a rather brilliant last-minute
course correction,

38
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:53,925
I've managed to materialise
the TARDIS inside the spaceship.

39
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,281
But to avoid hitting it,

40
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,562
I've had to make a random jump
back into normal space.

41
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:59,717
Terrific, but what do we do now?

42
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:02,446
Well, if I'm to get us back to Earth,
I'd better find out where we are.

43
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:04,199
I'll just go and check the instruments.

44
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:12,360
-Hmm, they're carrying bulk flour.
-DOCTOR: What?

45
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:15,041
They're carrying a cargo of bulk flour.

46
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:33,197
(HIGH-PITCHED BLEEPING)

47
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:47,363
-Doctor?
-Well, I think I know where we are.

48
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,278
I've got a pretty good idea about when.

49
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,562
-Come and take a look at this.
-A look at what?

50
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:53,160
That.

51
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:55,238
Well, it's just a spaceship, Jo.

52
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:59,240
Now, I reckon we must be somewhere
in the 26th century.

53
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:02,239
Well, interstellar travel's
pretty routine by now.

54
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:05,125
A moment ago, it seemed to change shape.

55
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:08,244
-Hmm?
-It was when I heard that noise.

56
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:09,965
Didn't you hear it?

57
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:12,436
Well, I did hear something
but very faintly.

58
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:13,801
Come on, Jo. Let's go and find the crew.

59
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,355
I want to find the exact date
for my calculations.

60
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:21,324
-Doctor! It's coming straight at us!
-DOCTOR: What?

61
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:24,077
HARDY: You won't believe this.

62
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:26,601
-Now what?
-Maybe it's a wreck.

63
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:28,965
Try and make contact.
They may need help.

64
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:32,562
This is Earth cargo ship C982
in close proximity to you.

65
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,319
Do you read me? Do you read me?

66
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,762
(WHITE NOISE OVER RADIO)

67
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:38,519
-Try again.
-Do you read me?

68
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:40,165
Are you in need of assistance?

(WHITE NOISE OVER RADIO)

70
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,119
It's a weird-looking crate.

HARDY: You can't take on
a battle cruiser!

76
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:08,400
Get the blasters!

77

Emergency, emergency, red alert.

78
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:13,157
This is Earth cargo ship C982

79
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:16,796
on coordinate 8972/6483.

80
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:20,402
We are under attack by a Draconian
battle cruiser, galaxy class,

81
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,159
equipped with neutronic missiles.

82

Emergency, emergency!

83
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,724
That's interesting.

84
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:39,401
-They must be going to do a linkup.
-What for?

85
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:41,478
Well, the two ships are joined together
by a sort of tunnel,

86
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:42,920
you see, with two airlocks.

87
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:45,316
Well, then they equalise the pressure
allowing the crew to move

88
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:48,001
from one ship to the other
without the use of space suits.

89
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:50,476
Otherwise, they'd have to get
all kitted up and do a space walk.

90
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,205
Fascinating, but let's get back
to the TARDIS.

91
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:55,199
Look, Jo, don't worry.
We'll be on our way soon.

92
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:57,721
Now, let's go and take look
at the ship's calendar.

-Drop that gun.
-Gun?

99
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:20,243
I haven't got a gun.
This is simply my hand.

-DOCTOR: Jo, what's the matter with you?
-He's a Drashig!

102
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:27,164
DOCTOR: Nonsense, it's simply a man
with a gun. Now pull yourself together.

103
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:33,320
This is Earth cargo ship C982.

Draconian battle cruiser
is now about to grapple.

106
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:41,363
They are going to lock on now.

Repeat, Draconian battle cruiser
about to lock on now.

<i>Open the hatch of your airlock.</i>

116

I found these two Dragons in the hold.

117
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:20,484
But that's impossible.
They... They're only just locking on.

118
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,523
Doctor, what's happening?
What's going on?

119
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,677
I'm not sure, Jo.
Something rather intriguing.

120

<i>If you resist, we can destroy you</i>

If you destroy our ship,
you won't get the cargo.

Oh, so that's what it's all about.

asking for help.

They will not survive
if you enter our ship.

But all these charges are false,
Your Highness.

We are not attacking Draconian ships.
We never have!

Actions?

You attack our ships,
you steal their cargoes,

you ignore our protests and just
meet them with these counter-charges.

00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:25,285
We have never violated that frontier.

157
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,996
You have invaded
our part of the galaxy many times.

158
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,079
In pursuit of your ships
when they have raided ours!

159
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:34,957
We've been very patient,
perhaps too patient.

160
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:36,685
General Williams!

161
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:39,678
I take it a rescue attempt
has been mounted?

162
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:41,803
We've established an
automatic procedure,

163
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,276
because of the frequency
of these attacks.

164
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:47,040
Then I suggest you go
and supervise the matter.

165
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:48,446
There's no need.

166
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:51,442
Please do as I say.

167
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:56,596
As you wish, Madam President.

168
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:08,037
Your general is insolent.

169
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:11,915
We know the hatred
he has always felt for our people.

170
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:14,316
Long ago he caused war.

171
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:16,875
Now he wishes to do so again.

172
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:20,164
He's a soldier, Your Highness,
and he's angry.

173
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,606
The people of Earth are angry.

174
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:27,316
So are the nobles of my father's court!

175
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:31,281
I must ask you to take my personal
appeal to your father, the Emperor.

176
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:34,837
He must put a stop to these attacks.

177
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:37,725
If Draconia has some grievances
against Earth,

178
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:40,605
then this is not the way
to deal with them.

179
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:44,843
Many of our noblemen felt
it was a mistake

180
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:47,395
to make a treaty with the Earthmen.

181
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:50,001
Perhaps they were right.

182
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:53,363
You attack our ships and when we protest

183
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:56,519
you trick us with lies and evasions.

184
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:59,646
I give you a final warning.

185
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:03,117
The path you are treading
leads only to war.

186
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:08,076
And in that war,
Draconia will destroy you!

187
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:15,278
In there.

188
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,923
-DOCTOR: Look...
-In there!

189
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:24,967
Doctor, what's happening on this ship?

190
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:29,723
Are they both mad or am I?
First I see a Drashig and...

191
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:33,322
No, you can put that away. Bolts.

192
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:36,285
And why do they keep calling us Dragons?

193
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:37,880
Well, that's the way they see us,
I suppose.

194
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:39,719
Yes, but why Dragons?

195
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:42,879
It's got to be some non-human life form.

196
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:48,678
Something that they're frightened of.
Dragons... Dragons.

197
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:52,118
-Yes, of course. Draconians.
-What?

198
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:54,846
Well, if this is the period that I think
it is, there are two great empires

199
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:56,645
spreading their way
through the galaxy of the Milky Way.

200
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:58,080
Empires? You mean like Solos?

201
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,237
Those were the declining years
of Earth's planetary empire,

202
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:01,999
this is just the beginning.

203
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,157
Now, Earth and Draconia
are both been expanding, you see.

204
00:12:04,247 --> 00:12:07,319
Colonising one planet after another,
and they're sitting on a powder keg.

205
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:09,477
Yes, but why do they mistake us
for these Dragons?

206
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:12,843
No, Draconians. No, Dragons
is rather an unflattering nickname.

207
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,122
Well, you remember that sound you heard?

208
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:17,118
-Yes.
-And the man that you saw with the gun?

209
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:19,721
Oh, no. No, no,
what I saw was a Drashig.

210
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:23,720
No, you didn't, Jo. That sound
made you see what you fear most.

211
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:26,077
-How?
-Well, it shouldn't be too difficult.

212
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:29,079
Ultrasonics geared to stimulate
the fear centres of the brain,

213
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:31,727
-something like that.
-How long does it last?

214
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:33,525
How long before they see
that we're just people?

215
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:35,518
Well, difficult to say.

216
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:38,599
It seems to act like a, sort of
post-hypnotic command.

217
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:41,679
It will fade eventually, of course.

-Why indeed?

220

Ah! They're jamming us.

226

Well, maybe the first message
got through. They'll send help.

227
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:22,480
Will they? They're probably still
passing memos to each other.

228
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:25,001
-They'll send help.
-I know what they'll do.

229
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:26,998
They'll send a note of protest
to the Draconian Embassy.

230
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:28,759
By that time, we'll be finished.

231
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:31,236
The Government should have blown the
blighters out of space years ago.

232

-And have another war?
-What do you think this is?

99% durilium.

in a hurry.

<i>Madam President,</i>

307
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:51,520
<i>-but it is not responding to signals.</i>
-And the Draconians?

308
00:17:51,607 --> 00:17:54,201
<i>There is no sign of</i>
<i>any Draconian ships, sir.</i>

309
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:59,997
<i>-They are about to board...now.</i>
-Thank you.

310
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,956
We shall soon know what really happened.

311
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:06,083
If there's anyone alive to tell them.

312
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:18,285
JO: (SOFTLY) Doctor?

313
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,561
-Jo?
-JO: Doctor!

314
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:30,320
-Jo?
-JO: Doctor, I'm over here.

315
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:42,403
All right, Jo, what are
you doing in there?

316
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:44,443
Oh, Doctor, thank goodness,
you're all right.

317
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:48,486
I thought they'd killed you.

318
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:50,364
Come on, come and sit down.

319
00:18:53,927 --> 00:18:56,805
Must have been some kind of
neuronic stun gun.

320
00:18:57,727 --> 00:19:01,515
I wonder why they didn't kill me?
What exactly happened, Jo?

321
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,724
Well, they took the cargo,
threw me in here and...

322
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:06,320
-Doctor?
-Hmm?

323
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:10,036
-They also took the TARDIS.
-Oh...

324
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:14,120
Oh, we're stranded.
What are we going to do?

325
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:15,799
Well, try and get
the TARDIS back, of course.

326
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:16,956
(JO SIGHS)

327
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:19,322
Why should the Ogrons attack this ship?

328
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:23,878
-To steal the cargo.
-No. No, there's more to it than that.

329
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:29,037
That... That sound that you heard,

330
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,278
it's all too sophisticated
for the Ogrons.

331
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:35,484
-Well, they're gone now.
-Yeah, the question is, where?

332
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:38,601
Hey, Doctor, last time we met the Ogrons

333
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:40,678
they were working for the Daleks, right?

334
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:43,839
-Well, you don't suppose that that...
-No, no, not necessarily.

335
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:46,395
No, the Ogrons are mercenaries.

336
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:49,320
Other life forms use them
to do their dirty work.

337
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:53,120
Come on, Jo, let's go and find the crew.

338
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:08,398
Take a look at that one.

339
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:12,920
Well, they're both stunned,
just as I was.

340
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:16,924
That's funny. The Ogrons
have repaired the airlock door.

341
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,440
Well, that was nice of them.

342
00:20:18,527 --> 00:20:20,438
Well, if they hadn't,
we'd have both been done for.

343
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:22,961
All the air would have escaped
when the ships unlocked.

344
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:24,685
Why should they go to all that trouble?

345
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:28,043
Well, maybe they've got kind hearts.
There's good in everyone you know, Jo.

We're being rescued.

-What happened?
-Well, don't worry, old chap.

365
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:42,278
You'll be all right now. I think...

366
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,562
Draconians! They're boarding!

367
00:21:44,647 --> 00:21:48,276
-Stewart? Who are you?
-Passengers.

368
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:53,198
I see. Having a fancy dress party?
What happened?

369
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:55,721
-Dragons attacked us.
-Did they get the cargo?

370
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:57,525
-I don't know.
-Yes, they took everything.

371
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,882
Including some rather valuable
property of mine.

372
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:03,164
-Well, tough luck.
-Oh, thank you very much.

373
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:06,842
-Dragons... They attacked us.
-Yes, we know.

374
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:09,646
You say you're passengers. Isn't that
a little unusual on a cargo ship?

375
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:11,160
Well, we're here, aren't we?

376
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,839
Where did you pick these two up?

377
00:22:12,927 --> 00:22:14,485
I don't know.
I can't seem to remember...

378
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,956
Pull yourself together!
How did they get on board?

379
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:20,804
Stowaways...
That's it, they were stowaways.

380
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:23,196
-They were sending messages.
-That's right.

381
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:26,723
They were helping the Dragons.
They're traitors!
