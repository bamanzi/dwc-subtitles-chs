2
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:35,687
But all these charges are false, Your Highness.

3
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:39,163
We are not attacking Draconian ships. We never have!

4
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,284
Our soldiers have seen the Earthmen attack us.

5
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,756
Our cargos have been stolen.

6
00:00:44,847 --> 00:00:49,045
We are Draconians, we do not lie.

7
00:00:49,127 --> 00:00:51,766
The honour of your race is well known, Your Highness.

8
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,838
That is why I cannot understand your actions.

9
00:00:53,927 --> 00:00:55,076
Actions?

10
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:58,557
You attack our ships, you steal their cargoes,

11
00:00:58,647 --> 00:01:02,162
you ignore our protests and just meet them with these counter-charges.

12
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:06,763
Our charges are true but yours are false.

13
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:09,315
We do not attack your ships.

14
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:18,516
Well, I'm never going in that thing again.

15
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:20,757
Oh, come on, Jo, be reasonable.

16
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,998
Only you could manage to have a traffic accident in space.

17
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:26,885
- Well, we didn't hit it, did we? - Didn't we? Where's this then?

18
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:28,878
Well, by a rather brilliant last-minute course correction,

19
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:31,925
I've managed to materialise the TARDIS inside the spaceship.

20
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:33,281
But to avoid hitting it,

21
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:35,562
I've had to make a random jump back into normal space.

22
00:01:35,647 --> 00:01:37,717
Terrific, but what do we do now?

23
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:40,446
Well, if I'm to get us back to Earth, I'd better find out where we are.

24
00:01:40,527 --> 00:01:42,199
I'll just go and check the instruments.

25
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:45,077
HARDY: You won't believe this.

26
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:47,601
- Now what? - Maybe it's a wreck.

27
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:49,965
Try and make contact. They may need help.

28
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:53,562
This is Earth cargo ship C982 in close proximity to you.

29
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,319
Do you read me? Do you read me?

30
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,762
(WHITE NOISE OVER RADIO)

31
00:01:57,847 --> 00:01:59,519
- Try again. - Do you read me?

32
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:01,165
Are you in need of assistance?

33
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,283
(WHITE NOISE OVER RADIO)

34
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,119
It's a weird-looking crate.

35
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:08,404
(HIGH PITCHED BLEEPING)

36
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:13,397
Draconians!

37
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:27,063
- Doctor? - Well, I think I know where we are.

38
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,978
I've got a pretty good idea about when.

39
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,262
- Come and take a look at this. - A look at what?

40
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:32,860
That.

41
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:34,938
Well, it's just a spaceship, Jo.

42
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:38,940
Now, I reckon we must be somewhere in the 26th century.

43
00:02:39,027 --> 00:02:41,939
Well, interstellar travel's pretty routine by now.

44
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:44,825
A moment ago, it seemed to change shape.

45
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:47,944
- Hmm? - It was when I heard that noise.

46
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:49,665
Didn't you hear it?

47
00:02:49,747 --> 00:02:52,136
Well, I did hear something but very faintly.

48
00:02:52,227 --> 00:02:53,501
Come on, Jo. Let's go and find the crew.

49
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:55,855
I want to find the exact date for my calculations.

50
00:02:55,987 --> 00:02:58,342
- HARDY: They're going to attack us! - STEWART: Get the blasters.

51
00:02:58,427 --> 00:03:00,065
HARDY: You can't take on a battle cruiser!

52
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,500
Get the blasters!

53
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:04,021
Emergency, emergency, red alert.

54
00:03:04,107 --> 00:03:06,257
This is Earth cargo ship C982

55
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:09,896
on coordinate 8972/6483.

56
00:03:09,987 --> 00:03:13,502
We are under attack by a Draconian battle cruiser, galaxy class,

57
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:15,259
equipped with neutronic missiles.

58
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:18,419
Emergency, emergency!

59
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:37,745
Oh, how do you do? I'm sorry about this intrusion.

60
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:39,021
HARDY: Who are you?

00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:40,142
(HIGH-PITCHED BLEEPING)

62
00:03:40,227 --> 00:03:42,502
DOCTOR: I said how do you do?
HARDY: Dragons!

63
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:46,301
- Drop that gun. - Gun?

64
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:48,343
I haven't got a gun. This is simply my hand.

65
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:49,860
(GASPING) No!

66
00:03:49,947 --> 00:03:52,063
-DOCTOR: Jo, what's the matter with you? - He's a Drashig!

67
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:55,664
DOCTOR: Nonsense, it's simply a man with a gun.
Now pull yourself together.

<i>(注: Jo 所看见的怪物名叫 Drashig , 这是在上一个故事 Carnival of Monsters 首次出现的一种猎食怪物)</i>

00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:01,420
This is Earth cargo ship C982.

70
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,384
Situation, red alert.

71
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:07,096
Draconian battle cruiser about to lock on now.

72
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:09,462
<i>All anti-boarding procedures carried out.</i>

73
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:12,425

75
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:23,939
<i>We are locked onto your vessel</i>

76
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:26,495

<i>If you offer any resistance,</i>

<i>you will be destroyed.</i>

79
00:04:32,587 --> 00:04:35,659
<i>Open the hatch of your airlock.</i>

80
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:38,864
I found these two Dragons in the hold.

81
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:41,984
But that's impossible. They... They're only just locking on.

82
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:44,023
Doctor, what's happening? What's going on?

83
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:46,177
I'm not sure, Jo. Something rather intriguing.

84
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:52,385
<i>If you resist, we can destroy you with our neutronic weapons.</i>

85
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:55,256
If you destroy our ship, you won't get the cargo.

86
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:57,298
Oh, so that's what it's all about.

87
00:04:57,387 --> 00:05:00,584
<i>Open the hatch to your airlock</i>

88
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:04,376
<i>or we shall enter your ship by force.</i>

89
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:06,458
- We refuse. - They can blow us to pieces!

90
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:08,902
I've sent a message to Earth asking for help.

91
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:12,820
This is a transcript of a distress call from one of our ships.

92
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:18,698
"From Earth's cargo ship number C982 on coordinate 8972/6483.

93
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:21,904
"We are under attack by a Draconian battle cruiser,

94
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:25,616
"galaxy class, equipped with neutronic missiles."

95
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:30,906
The treaty between our two empires established a frontier in space.

96
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:33,785
We have never violated that frontier.

97
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:37,896
You have invaded our part of the galaxy many times.

98
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:40,579
In pursuit of your ships when they have raided ours!

99
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,657
We've been very patient, perhaps too patient.

100
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,385
General Williams!

101
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,378
I take it a rescue attempt has been mounted?

102
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:50,503
We've established an automatic procedure,

103
00:05:50,587 --> 00:05:52,976
because of the frequency of these attacks.

104
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:55,740
Then I suggest you go and supervise the matter.

105
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:57,146
There's no need.

106
00:05:57,787 --> 00:06:00,142
Please do as I say.

107
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:05,296
As you wish, Madam President.

108
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:16,737
Your general is insolent.

109
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:20,615
We know the hatred he has always felt for our people.

110
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:23,016
Long ago he caused war.

111
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:25,575
Now he wishes to do so again.

112
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:28,864
He's a soldier, Your Highness, and he's angry.

113
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:32,306
The people of Earth are angry.

114
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:36,016
So are the nobles of my father's court!

115
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:39,981
I must ask you to take my personal appeal to your father, the Emperor.

116
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,537
He must put a stop to these attacks.

117
00:06:43,627 --> 00:06:46,425
If Draconia has some grievances against Earth,

118
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:49,305
then this is not the way to deal with them.

119
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:55,543
Many of our noblemen felt it was a mistake
to make a treaty with the Earthmen.

120
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:58,701
Perhaps they were right.

121
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:02,063
You attack our ships and when we protest

122
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:05,219
you trick us with lies and evasions.

123
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:08,346
I give you a final warning.

124
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,817
The path you are treading leads only to war.

125
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:16,776
And in that war, Draconia will destroy you!

Doctor, what are you doing?

129
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:33,560
I'm reversing the polarity of my ultrasonic screwdriver's power source,

130
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:36,605
thereby converting it into an extremely powerful electromagnet.

131
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,484
Oh. What good will that do?

132
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:41,035
You wait and see, Jo.

133
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:44,676

00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:46,922
Yes, I think so.

- I'm going to get the prisoners. - What for?

00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:51,238
We're using them as hostages, remember?

138
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:54,160
You'd better be quick about it. We haven't got much time.

Oh, how very embarrassing.  Good afternoon.

- Out. - That's just where we were going.

144
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,716
We're going to meet your friends.

they'll get you first.

They haven't boarded yet. They're still breaking through that door.

00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,603
All right, Jo, what are you doing in there?

156
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:20,643
Oh, Doctor, thank goodness, you're all right.

157
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,686
I thought they'd killed you.

Come on, come and sit down.

00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:33,005
Must have been some kind of neuronic stun gun.

I wonder why they didn't kill me? What exactly happened, Jo?

Well, they took the cargo, threw me in here and...

Oh, we're stranded. What are we going to do?

165
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:51,999
Well, try and get the TARDIS back, of course.

00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:55,522
Why should the Ogrons attack this ship?

168
00:09:55,607 --> 00:10:00,078
- To steal the cargo. - No. No, there's more to it than that.

That... That sound that you heard,

170
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:08,478
it's all too sophisticated for the Ogrons.

00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,684
- Well, they're gone now. - Yeah, the question is, where?

172
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:14,801
Hey, Doctor, last time we met the Ogrons

173
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:16,878
they were working for the Daleks, right?

174
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:20,039
- Well, you don't suppose that that... - No, no, not necessarily.

175
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:22,595
No, the Ogrons are mercenaries.

176
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:25,520
Other life forms use them to do their dirty work.

177
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:29,320
Come on, Jo, let's go and find the crew.

178
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:33,801
<i>(博士与 Jo 上一次碰到 Ogrons 是在09x01 The Day of the Daleks 这集,

179
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:44,598
Take a look at that one.

180
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,157
DOCTOR: It's all right, Jo. We're being rescued.

181
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,566
- What happened? - Well, don't worry, old chap.

182
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,008
You'll be all right now. I think...

183
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:02,062
Draconians! They're boarding!

184
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:06,476
- Stewart? Who are you? - Passengers.

185
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:11,098
I see. Having a fancy dress party? What happened?

186
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:13,621
- Dragons attacked us. - Did they get the cargo?

187
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,425
- I don't know. - Yes, they took everything.

188
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,782
Including some rather valuable property of mine.

189
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:21,064
- Well, tough luck. - Oh, thank you very much.

190
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,742
- Dragons... They attacked us. - Yes, we know.

191
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:27,546
You say you're passengers.
Isn't that a little unusual on a cargo ship?

192
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:29,060
Well, we're here, aren't we?

193
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,739
Where did you pick these two up?

194
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,385
I don't know. I can't seem to remember...

195
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:34,856
Pull yourself together! How did they get on board?

196
00:11:35,507 --> 00:11:38,704
Stowaways... That's it, they were stowaways.

197
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:40,796
- They were sending messages. - That's right.
