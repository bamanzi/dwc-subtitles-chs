1
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:11,439
- Hello, Jo. - Doctor!

2
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,918
- How are you? All right? - Well...

3
00:26:17,007 --> 00:26:19,885
Right, they'll be plenty of time
for the exchange of social pleasantries.

4
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:21,480
Put him inside.

5
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:39,923
Thank you, gentlemen.
You can leave them to me now.

6
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:47,556
Well, Doctor,
this is an interesting reversal.

7
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,798
I remember your once visiting me
when I was in prison.

8
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:53,366
You know, I'd very much
like to know why...

9
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:54,766
Why you've been locked up?

10
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,486
No, why I'm still alive.

11
00:26:57,687 --> 00:27:02,522
Oh, come, your health is very precious
to me, for the moment.

12
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:06,085
You see, my employers
are most interested in you.

13
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:10,126
-The Ogrons?
-Miss Grant, please! I employ them.

14
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:13,085
Yes, well, whatever it is you're up to,
you needn't expect any help from me.

15
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,646
I don't need any help.

16
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:17,161
Your simple presence
will be quite enough.

17
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:21,201
Oh, by the way, I need hardly warn you
there is no point in trying to escape.

18
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:23,198
This is an interplanetary
police spaceship,

19
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:26,040
specially built for carrying prisoners,
as you can see.

20
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:27,196
Stolen, of course?

21
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:30,438
(SCOFFING) Of course.
Oh, and another thing...

22
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:34,119
There's a closed-circuit television
camera trained on you from up there,

23
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:36,767
so you will be
under continuous observation.

24
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:38,166
I think that's all.

25
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:40,761
Well, now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some rather complicated

26
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:43,236
astro-navigational calculations
to work out.

27
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:45,045
May I ask where we're going?

28
00:27:45,127 --> 00:27:48,756
Certainly. To the home of our friends,
the Ogrons.

29
00:27:49,287 --> 00:27:52,802
A barren and uninteresting planet
on the remote fringes of the galaxy.

30
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:54,525
Why are you taking us there?

31
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:57,917
That, Miss Grant,
you will discover when you arrive.

32
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,397
Right, now listen to me.
We haven't got much time

33
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:06,125
before he gets back to the flight deck.

34
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,562
Now, the first thing
we've got to do is to escape.

35
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,002
Now, they took my sonic screwdriver
from me in the prison

36
00:28:11,087 --> 00:28:13,555
but they didn't get a hold of this.

37
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:16,764
-A steel file.
-Right, let's go.

38
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:18,997
No, not yet. Let's wait
till he gets back to the flight deck,

39
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:22,397
then he'll set the controls.
Now, this is an automatic spaceship.

40
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:24,842
Once we're underway,
the computers take over, right?

41
00:28:24,927 --> 00:28:26,883
-Okay, so what's the plan?
-Now this is what we're gonna do.

42
00:28:52,427 --> 00:28:54,497
<i>So I told the High Council</i>
<i>of the Time Lords,</i>

43
00:28:54,587 --> 00:28:58,466
<i>I said they had absolutely no right</i>
<i>to put me on trial in the first place.</i>

44
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:01,345
Well, if I chose to go wandering around
the universe in my own time,

45
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:02,496
that was my business.

46
00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:04,179
What about stealing the TARDIS?

47
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:06,861
I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it.

48
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:09,177
I fully intended to return it,
I assure you.

49
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:11,178
Anyway, she wasn't exactly
the latest model, poor old thing.

50
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,144
JO: (LAUGHING) You can say that again.

51
00:29:13,227 --> 00:29:15,866
I tell you, I made a complete fool
of that prosecuting council, though.

52
00:29:15,947 --> 00:29:18,142
I ridiculed his every argument.

53
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:20,377
Yes, and I told him
that I had the complete answer

54
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,946
to every one his charges against me.

55
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,426
JO: And then what happened?

56
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:26,180
DOCTOR: Then what happened, well,
they found me guilty,

57
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:28,986
changed my appearance
and exiled me to Earth.

58
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,705
JO: And that's where you met me!

59
00:29:30,787 --> 00:29:33,460
<i>That's right. That's where I met you.</i>

60
00:29:33,547 --> 00:29:35,902
<i>And that alone</i>
<i>made the exile worthwhile, Miss Grant.</i>

61
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:37,136
JO: <i>Thank you!</i>

62
00:29:37,227 --> 00:29:38,945
<i>Not that there's anything wrong</i>
<i>with Earth.</i>

63
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,541
<i>Well, it's quite a nice, little planet</i>
<i>in its own way, but...</i>

64
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:45,302
<i>After all, I am a Time Lord,Jo,</i>
<i>and I think I've deserve my freedom.</i>

65
00:29:45,387 --> 00:29:48,459
-JO: <i>Right!</i>
-In reminiscent mood, are you, Doctor?

66
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:50,856
Poor Miss Grant,
you have my deepest sympathy.

67
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:52,300
(CHUCKLING)

68
00:30:00,947 --> 00:30:03,222
As I soon realised,
the trouble with Lethbridge-Stewart

69
00:30:03,307 --> 00:30:04,706
is that he's got a military mind.

70
00:30:04,787 --> 00:30:07,824
Well, he is a brigadier, after all.
I mean, what do you expect?

71
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:08,976
No, that's just the trouble though.

72
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:12,423
He's hidebound, you see.
He always does everything by the rules.

73
00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:14,179
I keep telling him.
I said, "There are times, you know,

74
00:30:14,267 --> 00:30:16,701
"when you've simply got to cut
right through the red tape."

75
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:18,743
And you've managed to do that, have you?

76
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:22,058
DOCTOR: Yes, I've managed to cut
right through it.

77
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:27,946
And I'm not going to let authority
stand between me and my freedom.

78
00:30:28,347 --> 00:30:32,420
(SIGHING) Lethbridge-Stewart, I...

79
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:37,183
Hey! As far as he's concerned I've been
absent without leave all this time.

80
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:39,297
I'm always telling people ...

81
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:48,061
Is everything all right, Miss Grant?

82
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,097
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

83
00:30:51,427 --> 00:30:54,624
And how about you, Doctor?
No ill effects, I hope?

84
00:30:56,347 --> 00:30:58,383
Doctor, are you all right?

85
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:01,984
JO: <i>Please don't wake him.</i>
<i>He's...he's fast asleep.</i>

86
00:31:02,747 --> 00:31:07,867
Is he? How very relaxed of him.

87
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:10,262
you come with me, Miss Grant.

88
00:31:11,427 --> 00:31:12,746
Come on!

89
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:21,937
Right, in you go, Miss Grant.

90
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,098
Can you hear me, Doctor?

91
00:31:34,347 --> 00:31:37,862
<i>Are you on the flight deck?</i>
<i>If so, listen to this.</i>

92
00:31:38,707 --> 00:31:40,937
<i>Miss Grant is in the air lock.</i>

93
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,865
Unless you surrender yourself
to me immediately,

94
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:49,303
I shall open the outer door
and hurl her into space.

95
00:31:53,587 --> 00:31:56,420
What an ingenious fellow
you are, Doctor!

96
00:31:57,147 --> 00:31:59,183
Oh, no, you don't!

97
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:03,342
Now hold it, Doctor, hold it!

98
00:32:04,227 --> 00:32:06,661
Get that blaster over to me
or I press this button,

99
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:09,420
and that will be the end of Miss Grant!

100
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:18,179
(DOCTOR EXCLAIMING)

101
00:32:26,547 --> 00:32:27,775
Thank you, Doctor.

102
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:29,778
(THUDDING)

103
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:32,876
Well, we appear to have company.

104
00:32:39,387 --> 00:32:41,742
Would these be your Ogron friends?

105
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,226
Why, no, no.

106
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:47,659
Well, I should try and be
a bit more hospitable, old chap.

107
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:51,740
Come on, put that gun away.
They've probably got us outnumbered.

108
00:32:56,147 --> 00:32:59,378
Welcome on board my ship.
To what do I owe the honour?

109
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:02,379
Why have you violated
the Draconian frontier?

110
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:06,016
Uh, yes, I'm most apologetic about that,
but it was really beyond my control.

111
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:08,575
You see, my prisoners
were trying to escape and my...

112
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,897
-My ship was thrown off course.
-Prisoners?

113
00:33:10,987 --> 00:33:13,455
Yes, I am the commissioner
of Earth's Interplanetary Police.

114
00:33:13,547 --> 00:33:17,142
I'm taking these two people back
to planet Sirius 4 for...for trial.

115
00:33:17,227 --> 00:33:18,819
Uh, here is my warrant of authority.

116
00:33:18,907 --> 00:33:21,023
Now, don't believe this man, he's lying.

117
00:33:21,107 --> 00:33:24,224
I'm not concerned in disputes
between Earthmen.

118
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:27,461
We shall take them to Draconia.
Put them in the cage.

119
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,662
But you can't do that!

120
00:33:28,747 --> 00:33:30,146
I'm a commissioner
of Interplanetary Police!

121
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:33,105
This is my spaceship!
I tell you, you can't do that!

122
00:33:45,227 --> 00:33:48,617
Well, personally I'm quite happy
to be going to Draconia, Jo.

123
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:50,060
Perhaps we can convince the Emperor

124
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:51,785
what our friend here
has been trying to do.

125
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:53,937
You really think he'd believe you?

126
00:33:54,027 --> 00:33:56,700
Well, this won't be my first visit
to Draconia, you know?

127
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:59,460
Many years ago,
I spent quite some time there.

128
00:33:59,547 --> 00:34:02,220
I was able to help them through a period
of very great difficulty.

129
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:04,917
So there's a good chance
that they'll believe you, huh?

130
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:07,316
Well, it was a long time ago.
Things may have changed.

131
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:09,318
But I do understand
the Draconian mentality, Jo.

132
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:11,045
It all depends how you approach them.

133
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:14,437
So, if they do believe the Doctor,
you've had it!

134
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:16,722
Perhaps, Miss Grant, perhaps.

135
00:34:16,927 --> 00:34:19,964
But one never knows
when help may be at hand.

136
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:22,402
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I think that this is going to be

137
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:26,765
rather a long journey,
so, uh, good night.

138
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:30,076
We'll wake you with a cup of tea
in the morning.

139
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:31,486
Thank you.
