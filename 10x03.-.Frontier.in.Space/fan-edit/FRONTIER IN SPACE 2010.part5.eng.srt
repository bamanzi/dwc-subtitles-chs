1
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:59,356
So, Father, once more
Earthmen have invaded our space.

2
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:03,156
You will address the Emperor
in a proper manner.

3
00:35:03,247 --> 00:35:04,396
Your pardon.

4
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:07,445
May I have permission
to address the Emperor?

5
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:11,925
My life at your command.

6
00:35:12,007 --> 00:35:15,716
One day, my Son,
you will inherit this throne.

7
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:19,800
Then you will realise
the importance of due formality.

8
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:22,685
Now, what do you wish to say?

9
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:26,203
Surely, now you will declare war
upon the Earthmen?

10
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:28,437
Let me lead your battle fleets
to crush their...

11
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:31,087
They too, have battle fleets, my Son.

12
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:34,000
Such a war could
well bring down both empires.

13
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:37,238
Not if we strike first,
then we shall be the victors!

14
00:35:37,327 --> 00:35:40,763
In such a war, there are no victors.

15
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,600
The nobles of the court
are demanding action.

16
00:35:43,687 --> 00:35:45,678
They fear for the honour of Draconia.

17
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:51,205
I am the emperor!
The honour of Draconia is vested in me.

18
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:55,200
The throne depends upon
the great families for support.

19
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:58,006
Emperors have been deposed before now.

20
00:35:58,087 --> 00:36:01,841
An emperor who does not rule
deposes himself!

21
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:04,798
Then what will you do, Father?

22
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:07,845
I shall question these Earthmen myself.

23
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:09,963
I have already sent for them.

24
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:12,720
Why waste time listening to their lies?

25
00:36:19,247 --> 00:36:22,364
Majesty, I bring the prisoners.

26
00:36:23,007 --> 00:36:25,965
May I have permission
to address the Emperor?

27
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:27,476
Wait!

28
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:29,285
This is an insult!

29
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,803
My life at your command, sire.

30
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:36,445
How dare you address the Emperor

31
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,597
in a manner reserved
for a noble of Draconia?

32
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:40,882
Ah, but I am a noble of Draconia.

33
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:43,197
The honour was conferred on me
by the 15th Emperor.

34
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:47,439
The 15th Emperor reigned 500 years ago.

35
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:48,596
(LAUGHING)

36
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:53,158
Your Majesty, do not be taken
in by this ridiculous story...

37
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:54,760
Be silent!

38
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:57,399
There is a legend
among our people of a man

39
00:36:57,487 --> 00:37:00,718
who assisted the 15th Emperor
at a time of great trouble

40
00:37:00,807 --> 00:37:06,165
when we were almost overwhelmed
by a great plague from outer space.

41
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:11,844
But you could not be that man.
No Earthman lives so long.

42
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:14,487
Your Majesty,
this man that you speak of,

43
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,444
was he not known as the Doctor?

44
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:20,438
And did he not come to this planet
in a spaceship called the TARDIS?

45
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:21,846
He did.

46
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:23,963
Well, I am that man, sire.

47
00:37:24,487 --> 00:37:27,684
And I come from a race of people
that live far longer than any Earthman.

48
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:31,362
Even if I accept your claim,
you have broken our law.

49
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:34,837
Why did you violate Draconian space?

50
00:37:34,927 --> 00:37:38,078
Your Majesty, this man was,
and still is, my prisoner.

51
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:39,839
It is true, Your Majesty.

52
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:43,158
I did come here as a prisoner,
but I came willingly,

53
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:45,363
in order to inform you that
this man is plotting a war

54
00:37:45,447 --> 00:37:46,721
between Earth and Draconia!

55
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:48,957
All Earthmen are determined upon war.

56
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:51,607
Ah, but the Master is not an Earthman.

57
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,838
I'm sorry to have to admit it,
but he's a renegade of my own race

58
00:37:54,927 --> 00:37:57,521
and he's using creatures called Ogrons

59
00:37:57,607 --> 00:37:59,802
to attack your spaceships
and those of the Earthmen.

60
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:02,720
The Earthmen who attacked
our spaceships,

61
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:04,843
they have been seen many times.

62
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:06,918
I'm sorry,
but there you are in error, sir.

63
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:08,918
Your people have seen Ogrons,

64
00:38:09,007 --> 00:38:11,999
but they appear to them as Earthmen
because of a hypnotic device.

65
00:38:12,087 --> 00:38:13,645
It's true, Your Majesty.

66
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:15,797
When the Ogrons attacked
the Earth ships,

67
00:38:15,887 --> 00:38:18,037
the Earthmen saw them as Draconians.

68
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:21,483
Silence! Females are not permitted
to speak in the presence of the Emperor.

69
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:25,446
Your Majesty, do not be deceived
by the pathetic ravings

70
00:38:25,527 --> 00:38:27,802
of two criminals
trying to evade justice.

71
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:31,641
If what you say is true,
it would explain much.

72
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:34,287
We lived at peace with the Earthmen
for many years,

73
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:37,404
then suddenly they began
to raid our spaceships.

74
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:40,843
When we protested,
they said that we were attacking them.

75
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:42,883
In order to cover up their own attacks!

76
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:47,245
This is simply a plot of the Earthmen
to lull us into false security.

77
00:38:50,047 --> 00:38:51,196
Speak!

78
00:38:51,607 --> 00:38:53,518
Your Majesty, a spaceship from Earth

79
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:56,201
seeks permission to land
in the palace spaceport.

80
00:38:56,287 --> 00:38:59,438
They say they're on a special mission
from the President of Earth.

81
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:01,563
This is a trick!
You must not allow them to land!

82
00:39:01,647 --> 00:39:03,922
We are not yet at war with Earth.

83
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:07,079
I shall hear what
their president has to say.

84
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:08,725
I give my permission.

85
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,240
Your Majesty.

86
00:39:10,327 --> 00:39:12,363
A wise decision, Your Majesty.

87
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:14,278
For only by Earth and Draconia
working together

88
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:16,358
can we hope to arrive at the truth.

89
00:39:16,447 --> 00:39:18,836
I, too, welcome your wisdom,
Your Majesty.

90
00:39:18,927 --> 00:39:22,044
Nobody could be more devoted
to the cause of peace than I.

91
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:24,243
As a commissioner of Earth's
Interplanetary Police,

92
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:27,524
I have devoted my life
to the cause of law and order.

93
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:30,644
And law and order can only exist
in a time of peace.

94
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:32,877
You feeling all right, old chap?

95
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:35,686
Only during a period
of social stability,

96
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:38,600
can society adequately
deal with criminals

97
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:40,279
such as this man
and this unfortunate girl.

98
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:41,402
(HYPNOTIC PULSE SOUNDING)

99
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:44,001
Doctor, listen! That sound!

100
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,195
PRINCE: Silence, female!

101
00:39:46,287 --> 00:39:47,515
Quiet!

102
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:50,644
It's the same noise
that I heard on the cargo ship.

103
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:51,921
Doctor, it's the Ogrons!

104
00:39:52,007 --> 00:39:54,726
Your Majesty,
I beg of you to be cautious.

105
00:39:54,807 --> 00:39:56,957
Something is seriously wrong here.
This ship that has just landed,

106
00:39:57,047 --> 00:39:58,446
I beg you,
place it under guard immediately.

107
00:39:58,527 --> 00:40:00,006
Your Majesty, please?

108
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:02,362
DRACONIAN: (SHOUTING) Earthmen!

109
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:05,398
MASTER: Seize them, fool!

110
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:08,483
(ALL GRUNTING)

111
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:11,286
Ah, you idiots!
Back to the ship, all of you!

112
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,403
Come on, back to the ship!

113
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:17,325
Now will you believe
in the treachery of the Earthmen?

114
00:40:17,407 --> 00:40:20,558
Your Majesty, look down here
and tell me, what do you see?

115
00:40:20,647 --> 00:40:22,239
(HYPNOTIC PULSE SOUNDING)

116
00:40:24,807 --> 00:40:27,480
I see one of your Earth soldiers

117
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:31,003
who attacked my palace
and killed my people.

118
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:33,840
Jo? Jo, can you still hear that sound?

119
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:34,962
(HYPNOTIC PULSE FADING)

120
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:37,515
Yes, it's fading. It's almost gone.

121
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:39,325
Your Majesty, I beg of you, please.
Look again.

122
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:41,602
Why do we delay? Destroy him!

123
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:43,482
Wait!

124
00:40:46,887 --> 00:40:49,685
He has spoken the truth.

125
00:41:00,047 --> 00:41:02,197
Great, lumbering idiots!

126
00:41:02,287 --> 00:41:06,121
Now you tell me that you've left
one of your fellows in the palace!

127
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:07,879
Do you realise what this means?

128
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:10,481
As soon as the effect
of the hypno-sound wears off,

129
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:13,479
the Draconians will know
who it really was who attacked them.

130
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:14,716
You've ruined everything!

131
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:16,286
What shall we do now?

132
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:19,962
Do? There's only one thing we can do.

133
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:22,242
Make sure that the Doctor
and his evidence

134
00:41:22,327 --> 00:41:24,636
is never allowed to reach Earth.

135
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:32,477
Why does the Master want war
between Earth and Draconia?

136
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:35,843
Did you attack our spaceships
and those of the Earthmen?

137
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,316
Oh, it's no good.
We're not getting anywhere.

138
00:41:38,407 --> 00:41:40,796
Let me take him for questioning.
He will answer to me.

139
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:42,400
I shall use the mind probe.

140
00:41:42,487 --> 00:41:44,557
You'd only be wasting your time.

141
00:41:44,647 --> 00:41:47,525
The Ogrons have got the finest
defence mechanism of all, stupidity.

142
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:48,756
They haven't got a mind
for you to probe.

143
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:52,203
Then remove him.
We will deal with him later.

144
00:41:55,207 --> 00:42:00,042
Why did that sound make us see
this creature as a soldier from Earth?

145
00:42:00,127 --> 00:42:01,958
Because you're frightened of Earthmen.

146
00:42:02,047 --> 00:42:04,242
Draconians fear nothing, female.

147
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:08,479
Well, of course you do.
You fear them and they fear you.

148
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,718
That's why when Earthmen
heard that sound, they saw Draconians.

149
00:42:11,807 --> 00:42:13,081
That is true.

150
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:18,287
We do fear the Earthmen
and they fear us.

151
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:20,801
And fear breeds hatred, Your Majesty.

152
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:24,197
Fear is the greatest enemy of them all,
for fear leads us to war.

153
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:27,438
We shall tell the Earthmen
what has happened here.

154
00:42:27,527 --> 00:42:29,358
They, too, must know the truth.

155
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:31,085
They will not believe us.

156
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:32,805
The Prince is right, Your Majesty.

157
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:35,959
We must mount an expedition at once
and we must take the Ogron as evidence.

158
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:38,197
The empires are on the verge of war.

159
00:42:38,287 --> 00:42:40,198
A Draconian spaceship in Earth space

160
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:43,723
could be destroyed before it
reaches its destination.

161
00:42:43,807 --> 00:42:45,763
We could use the ship
the Master brought us in.

162
00:42:45,847 --> 00:42:47,166
It's an Earth police spaceship.

163
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:49,283
Females are not permitted to speak...

164
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:50,766
The female may speak.

165
00:42:50,847 --> 00:42:53,077
-But...
-We must respect

166
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:56,796
the customs of our guests,
strange though they may be.

167
00:42:56,887 --> 00:42:58,798
The suggestion had merit.

168
00:42:58,887 --> 00:43:00,684
Thank you, Your Majesty.

169
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:02,837
You too, will go on this mission.

170
00:43:02,927 --> 00:43:05,646
But it must be headed
by a Draconian of noble rank.

171
00:43:05,727 --> 00:43:07,877
I shall send my son.

172
00:43:14,447 --> 00:43:16,119
Doctor, where are we?

173
00:43:16,207 --> 00:43:18,596
We're just about to cross
the frontier into Earth space.

174
00:43:18,687 --> 00:43:20,166
Ooh, that's good.

175
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:22,761
Unless your Earth people destroy us.

176
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:25,077
Well, this is an Earth police spaceship,
you know, sir.

177
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,078
Even if it is stolen.

178
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,397
What is that?

179
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:31,637
DOCTOR: It looks like another spaceship.

180
00:43:31,727 --> 00:43:33,957
It appears to be following us.

181
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:41,360
OGRON: Look!

182
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:44,964
MASTER: Well, that must be them.

183
00:43:45,267 --> 00:43:49,226
DOCTOR: We should be picking them up
on the visual scanner now.

184
00:43:52,707 --> 00:43:54,618
JO: It's an Ogron ship!

185
00:43:54,867 --> 00:43:55,982
Fire!

186
00:44:17,547 --> 00:44:18,866
DOCTOR: Hang on.
I think we're shaking them off.

187
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,062
(OGRON GRUNTING)

188
00:44:20,147 --> 00:44:21,262
Doctor!

189
00:44:21,347 --> 00:44:23,542
He's broken out! Get out, Jo!

190
00:44:25,347 --> 00:44:26,826
MASTER: We must have hit them.
They're losing speed.

191
00:44:26,907 --> 00:44:28,056
OGRON: Shall I fire again?

192
00:44:28,147 --> 00:44:32,060
No, no, it might be possible
to take the Doctor alive after all.

193
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:33,466
Muster a boarding party.

194
00:44:33,547 --> 00:44:34,446
Yes, Master.

195
00:44:35,247 --> 00:44:36,839
(OGRON GRUNTING)

196
00:44:37,487 --> 00:44:39,796
Right, there you are, my friend.

197
00:44:45,927 --> 00:44:47,645
Are you all right?

198
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,479
JO: Oh, no, you don't!

199
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:51,603
No, no!

200
00:44:51,687 --> 00:44:53,166
-No, let go of me!
-This way!

201
00:44:53,247 --> 00:44:54,362
JO: Let me go!

202
00:44:54,447 --> 00:44:56,119
We've been boarded!
We need the blasters, come on!

203
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:57,435
-The prisoner?
-Don't worry about him.

204
00:44:57,527 --> 00:44:58,801
He's no use to us at the moment.

205
00:44:58,887 --> 00:45:01,924
JO: Let me go! No! Doctor!

206
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:06,081
DOCTOR: Get down!
OGRON: The enemy!

207
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,279
OGRON: Fool, go!

208
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:12,119
JO: Help! Doctor!
OGRON: You come!

209
00:45:12,207 --> 00:45:13,481
-You must come!
-No!

210
00:45:13,567 --> 00:45:16,161
Look out! We must take the girl!

211
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:17,282
No!

212
00:45:19,327 --> 00:45:20,601
In here!

213
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:25,637
MASTER: Right. Unlock!

<i>This is Earth battle cruiser X29.</i>

215

00:45:39,527 --> 00:45:41,882
<i>Do you read me? Identify yourself.</i>

218
00:45:41,967 --> 00:45:46,459
Hello, this is Earth
police spaceship 2390,

219
00:45:46,547 --> 00:45:48,542
on a special mission
to the President of Earth. Over.

220
00:45:48,687 --> 00:45:51,679
CAPTAIN: <i>Identify the ship</i>
<i>that has just unlocked from you.</i>

221
00:45:51,767 --> 00:45:53,678
<i>They refuse to answer our signals.</i>

222
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:55,325
Look, it's of vital importance

223
00:45:55,407 --> 00:45:58,001
that you pursue and capture
that ship immediately. Over.

224
00:45:58,087 --> 00:46:00,999
<i>You are in possession</i>
<i>of a stolen police spaceship.</i>

225
00:46:01,087 --> 00:46:03,123
<i>You are under arrest.</i>
<i>Stand by to be boarded.</i>

226
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:04,526
DOCTOR ON RADIO:
<i>Look, you don't understand.</i>

227
00:46:04,607 --> 00:46:07,326
<i>The man who stole this ship</i>
<i>is escaping in that vessel.</i>

228
00:46:07,407 --> 00:46:08,522
CAPTAIN: <i>You are under arrest.</i>

229
00:46:08,607 --> 00:46:11,360
<i>You'll be given the opportunity</i>
<i>of making a full statement.</i>

230
00:46:11,447 --> 00:46:14,723
<i>Do not offer any resistance.</i>
<i>Stand by to be boarded.</i>

231
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:17,640
DOCTOR: <i>Oh, very well.</i>
<i>We're standing by.</i>

232
00:46:17,727 --> 00:46:18,842
(LAUGHING)

233
00:46:18,927 --> 00:46:23,557
Poor Doctor.
Enmeshed in the throes of bureaucracy.

234
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:24,716
(LAUGHING)

235
00:46:24,807 --> 00:46:27,162
It'll take him a long time
to talk himself out of that one.

236
00:46:27,247 --> 00:46:29,761
But he'll get to see the President,
eventually.

237
00:46:29,847 --> 00:46:30,882
She won't believe him.

238
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:34,357
Oh, yes, she will,
when she sees the Ogron prisoner.

239
00:46:34,447 --> 00:46:36,119
He's our evidence.

240
00:46:37,847 --> 00:46:40,725
Your evidence is standing
right behind you.

241
00:46:43,527 --> 00:46:47,076
The Draconian Prince knows
the truth and he's with the Doctor.

242
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:51,604
My dear, Miss Grant, in the climate
of opinion that I have created,

243
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:53,166
do you think that any Earthman

244
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:55,283
is going to believe the word
of a Draconian?

245
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:00,043
Your Highness,
we've heard the Doctor's theory before.

246
00:47:00,127 --> 00:47:03,836
And, with respect,
there is still no concrete evidence.

247
00:47:03,927 --> 00:47:06,236
I myself would like to believe you
but, as you can see,

248
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:08,397
I need proof to convince my people.

249
00:47:08,487 --> 00:47:10,717
Then we must mount an expedition
to the planet of the Ogrons.

250
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:11,956
The proof we need is there, madam.

251
00:47:12,047 --> 00:47:14,163
With Earth on the brink of war,
how can we divert our forces

252
00:47:14,247 --> 00:47:16,317
into such a pointless expedition?

253
00:47:16,807 --> 00:47:19,446
My dear chap,
I'm not asking for a battle fleet.

254
00:47:19,527 --> 00:47:21,757
All I require is one small spaceship.

255
00:47:29,687 --> 00:47:34,715
Well, Miss Grant,
welcome to my humble abode.

256
00:47:34,807 --> 00:47:36,320
I think you were better off in prison.

257
00:47:36,407 --> 00:47:37,556
Oh, temporary quarters, my dear.

258
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:40,036
I shall soon be changing them
for something better.

259
00:47:40,127 --> 00:47:41,924
Oh, you'll soon be back in jail.

260
00:47:42,007 --> 00:47:43,042
When the truth gets out,

261
00:47:43,127 --> 00:47:45,880
Earth and Draconia will combine
their forces to attack you.

262
00:47:45,967 --> 00:47:49,403
I don't think so.
There's too much distrust between them.

263
00:47:49,487 --> 00:47:51,045
The Doctor will find you, eventually.

264
00:47:51,127 --> 00:47:54,642
Ah, there I agree with you.
He must find me.

265
00:47:54,727 --> 00:47:57,366
Not only to rescue you,

266
00:47:57,447 --> 00:48:01,565
but also to be reunited
with his beloved TARDIS.
