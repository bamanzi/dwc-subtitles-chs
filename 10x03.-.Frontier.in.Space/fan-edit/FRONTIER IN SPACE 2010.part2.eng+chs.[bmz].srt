1
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,398
But that's absolute nonsense.
这绝对是胡说

2
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:47,876
Look, we didn't want to be on this ship. It was an accident.
是这样, 我们并不想到这艘船上来的, 是一次事故

3
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,639
You said you were passengers.
你刚说你们是乘客

4
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:53,561
I was merely trying to avoid a lot of tiresome explanations, old chap.
我只是想把事情弄简单一点, 免得浪费半天口舌, 老伙计

6
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,322
What about these two?
这两个人怎么办?

7
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:58,681
Lock them in the hold, put a guard on them.
把他们所进置留室, 派人看着他们

8
00:11:58,807 --> 00:12:01,321
- But we haven't done anything. - They say you have. Take them away.
- 但我们没干过任何事啊 - 他们说你干过. 带走

00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,442
Now, if you'll only listen to me...

You can talk to Earth Security.

Oops. No need to push.

Doctor, well, now the Ogrons have gone,
博士, 对了, 既然 Ograns 已经走了

16
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:29,527
why don't the crewmen remember what really happened?
为什么这些船员还是想不起来真正发生了什么?

17
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:32,326
Because the true facts have been erased from their minds, that's why.
因为真相已经从他们大脑里面抹掉了, 这就是为什么

18
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:34,602
Well, yes, but why did they keep telling lies about us?
哦, 这样, 但为什么他们又一直说胡说八道呢?

19
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,518
Oh, they don't know that they're lying, Jo.
哦, 他们并不知道他们在胡说八道, Jo

20
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:39,167
They're desperately trying to fit us into their version of things.
他们只是在尽力地把我们装进他们那个版本的真实中去

21
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:41,477
Well, what are we going to do then?
那, 我们该怎么办?

22
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:43,080
Well, when we get back to Earth,
现在, 等我们回到地球

23
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:46,364
we've got to reach someone in authority
whose mind isn't already closed.
我们应该能碰到某个当权者, 他的大脑没有那么封闭?

24
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:47,675
Closed to what?
封闭?

25
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,200
Jo, look, these people believe
Jo, 你看, 这些人相信

26
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:51,278
that the Draconians are attacking their spaceships, right?
是龙族人袭击了他们的飞船, 对吧?

27
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,039
- Right. - We know that they're wrong, don't we?
- 是的   - 我们知道他们说的是错的, 是不?

28
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:54,446
Well, yes, it was Ogrons.

have created that hallucinatory device

31
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:00,801
that makes the Earthmen think they're Draconians.
可以让地球人产生错觉, 以为是龙族人袭击了他们

32
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:03,526
Oh. Oh, well, that's simple then.
哦, 哦, 这样就简单了

33
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:07,202
I mean, what we've got to is find out what's going on,
我是说, 我们要做的, 就是搞明白到底是怎么一回事

34
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,597
who's behind the Ogrons, where they've taken the TARDIS,
谁在操纵这些 Ogrons, 他们又把 TARDIS 带到哪里去了

35
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:13,247
go and get it back and then we can all go home.
我们去把它找回来, 然后我们就可以回家了

- Right? - Right.

Oh. I don't know what I've been worrying about.

<i>We are now in space port 10.</i>
我们正在十号太空站

39
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,958
<i>The ship will land in 15 minutes. The crew are safe.</i>
飞船将在15分钟内降落, 船员都安全

40
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:29,801
<i>Also aboard, two human stowaways, origins unknown.</i>
船上还有两个偷渡的人类, 来源未知

41
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:32,560
I want a cordon around the landing area,
the minute that ship touches down.
我需要飞船一着地, 就在周边拉起警戒线

42
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:34,365
Nobody on, nobody off till I get there.
在我到达之前, 任何人不得进入, 任何人不得离开

43
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,482
<i>Sir.</i>
先生

44
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:38,859
I'd better get down there.
I want handle the preliminary interrogations myself.

You're going to, but outside.
你会见到的, 不过得先出来

47
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:51,338
Now then, what's all this about?
既然这样, 这些又什么意思

48
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:55,318
- Draconian agents? Are you sure? - What else can they be?
- 龙族特工? 你确定吗?   - 要不然还能是什么

49
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:56,840
Their story is obvious nonsense.
他们的故事显然说不通啊

50
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:58,679
But why? We...
为什么? 我们...

51
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:00,678
Why would the Draconians leave them on board the ship?

00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:03,122
The Draconians are preparing for war.
那些龙族人正在准备一场战争

53
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:05,596
You're still only suspecting that. There is no proof.

54
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:07,439
Then they need to plant human agents,

00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:10,405
traitors, on this planet to sabotage our war effort.

But we are bound to suspect them. They must have realised.
但我们肯定会怀疑他们啊, 他们肯定能想到这个

57
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:16,045
The Draconians probably thought the crew was dead.
那些龙族人也许认为船员都死了

58
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:18,038
We could easily have accepted those two as passengers,

59
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:21,278
two unfortunate refugees from a Draconian attack,

- When did you last eat? - Quite some while ago.

Well, I'll see they send you some food.

I'm going straight back to my ship.
我就直接回我的船了

65
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:38,335
Don't want to get mixed up with security.
别想着破坏这里的安保设施

66
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:40,145
It's not healthy.
这对你不好

67

- Look, I'll give you a piece of advice. - DOCTOR: Yes?

68
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:47,977
Sooner or later, you're going to tell them everything.
或早或迟, 你们都给告诉他们全部实情

69
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,818
They'll use the mind probe. You talk to them now.
他们会使用思维探测器的, 你们还是现在就说实话吧

70
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:55,500
You'll save yourselves a lot of trouble.
这也可以给你们自己省去很多麻烦

71
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:02,779
PRESIDENT: And you are quite sure it was a Draconian battle cruiser.

72
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:03,902
Of course, Madam.
当然, 夫人

73
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,500
They locked on and boarded us.

00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:08,101
We saw them. They were Draconians.

75
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:11,064

00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:14,139
I hope you will soon recover from your ordeal.

77
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:21,186
Well, Your Highness?
怎样, 殿下? 

78
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,303
These men are your servants.
他们都是你的人

79
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:26,220
They are saying what they have been ordered to say.
你们让他们说什么, 他们就说什么

80
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:29,538
On this occasion, we have more than our servants to confront you with.
这次不同了, 能跟你对质的不仅仅是我们的人

81
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:31,265
We have captured two of your human agents.
我们抓住了你的两个人类间谍

82
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,303

by the treaty of peace between our two empires.

85
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:41,336
A treaty which you have flagrantly broken.

87
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:46,663
Just a moment please, Your Highness. Bring them in.
请等一下, 殿下. 把他们带进来

88
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:54,306
These people stowed away on the cargo ship.

which enabled your battle cruiser to home in on its prey.

91
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:00,258
I know nothing of this.
我对此毫不知情

92
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:04,545
Perhaps you do not, but some servant of the Draconian empire employed them.
也许你是不知道, 但龙族帝国的某些人雇佣了他们

夫人, 我可以保证, 我从来没有被任何人雇佣

94
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,778
Least of all by the Draconians.
更别说被龙族人雇佣了

95
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:14,780
Your servants should have been better rehearsed in their lies.
你的喽罗应该好好排练一下如何撒谎

96
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:18,064
Or they're showing a misguided loyalty to their Draconian masters.
或许他们只是对龙族主人展现了错误的忠诚 (fixme)

97
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:19,944
If we really were working for the Draconians,

why did they leave us in your ship?

Allow me to congratulate you, sir.

You have the most totally closed mind that I've ever encountered.

Madam, I beg of you to listen to me.

Some third party is trying to provoke war between Earth and Draconia.

Why should a third party wish to do this?

108
00:16:40,907 --> 00:16:41,976
I've no idea, Madam,
我不知道, 夫人

109
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,386
but believe me, that is what is happening.
但相信我, 这就是真相

110
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:44,582
Take them away.
把他们带走

111
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,259
Now please listen to me! If you don't
现在请听我说! 如果你不听的话

112
00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:50,977
you'll be involved in a war that could cause the death of millions.
你们就会卷入一场战争, 百万生灵将因此丧命

113
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:56,856
Is this the evidence upon which you accuse me?
这就是你们控诉我的证据?

114
00:16:57,507 --> 00:17:00,624
I must ask you to convey a formal protest to your Emperor.
我必须要求你向你的皇帝转达我们的正式抗议

115
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:05,986
I shall inform him of this latest insult
to the honour of the Draconian empire.
我会告诉他的, 告诉他你们对龙族尊严的侮辱

116
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:18,155
But why?
不过为什么?

117
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:22,157
Why should they produce such an elaborate lie?
为什么要编造一个如此复杂的谎言

118
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:28,000
The ways of the Earthmen are devious. They're an inscrutable species.
地球人的行为很怪异, 他们这个种族真是难以揣测

119
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:33,036
Obviously, they are preparing the next stage of their plan.
很显然, 他们在为他们自己计划的下一步铺路

120
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:38,197
First, the attacks on our ships and now this.
首先, 攻击我们的船, 然后又是这个

121
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:43,563
Is it possible, Your Highness,
that for once the Earthmen spoke the truth?
有没有可能, 殿下, 这一次地球人说的是事实?

122
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:47,925
Some plan of the Emperor of which Your Highness has not been informed?
皇帝有他自己的计划, 而没有告知殿下?

123
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:51,443
The Emperor would not possibly contemplate such a plan.
我们的皇帝不会弄出这样的计划

124
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:54,087
We do not break the treaty of peace.
我们不能打破和平协定

125
00:17:57,287 --> 00:18:01,678
Shall I prepare your Excellency's report
to the Emperor on this meeting?

126
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,596
I must have more information.
我必须获得更多的信息

127
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:11,404
It would be useful to question the humans who were found on the ship.
如果能审讯一下船上找到的那两个人, 应该会有帮助

128
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:16,236
They are supposed to be prisoners.
他们肯定被囚禁起来了

129
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:21,075
Prisoners have been known to escape, Your Highness.
被囚禁的人都是可以逃走的, 殿下

130
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,205
Not without help.
那得有人帮忙才行

131
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,759
And that would be a grave act of hostility.
而这可是严重的敌对行为

132
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:30,205
I could not possibly countenance such a plan.
我不可能支持这样的计划

133
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:39,922
But, should two escaping prisoners seek sanctuary in this embassy,
但是, 如果两个逃犯到大使馆来寻求庇护

134
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:44,759
it would be uncivilised to turn them away.
我们弃而不管就太不人道了

135
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:52,155
I must not detain you longer.
我就不再耽搁你了

136
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:57,437
No doubt you have duties demanding your attention?
无疑你现在还有更需要你关注的事情?

137
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:01,245
Your Highness.
殿下
