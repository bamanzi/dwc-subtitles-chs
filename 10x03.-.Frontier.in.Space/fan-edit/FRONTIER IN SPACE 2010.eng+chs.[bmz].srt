We're using them as hostages, remember?
我们可以用他们作为人质，记得吧?

- 但他们不是我们的朋友! - 你们俩是他们登船小队的成员

They haven't boarded yet. They're still breaking through that door.
他们还没有登船. 他们还在切割舱门呢

- 能不能讲点理，伙计 - 他们过来了

Oh, Doctor, thank goodness, you're all right.

Come on, come and sit down.

00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:33,005
Must have been some kind of neuronic stun gun.

166
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:37,715
I wonder why they didn't kill me? What exactly happened, Jo?
很奇怪他们为什么没杀了我? 到底发生了什么，Jo?

- They also took the TARDIS. - Oh...

Oh, we're stranded. What are we going to do?

Well, try and get the TARDIS back, of course.
当然是想办法把 TARDIS 弄回来

(JO SIGHS)

173
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:55,522
Why should the Ogrons attack this ship?
为什么 Ogrons 要攻击这艘船?

174
00:09:55,607 --> 00:10:00,078
- To steal the cargo. - No. No, there's more to it than that.
- 为了偷货呗 - 不，不，远不仅于此

175
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:05,237
That... That sound that you heard,
那个...你听到的那个声音

176
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:08,478
it's all too sophisticated for the Ogrons.
对于 Ogrons 来说过于复杂了

177

No, the Ogrons are mercenaries.
不，这些 Ogrons 都是雇佣兵

182
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:25,520
Other life forms use them to do their dirty work.

Come on, Jo, let's go and find the crew.
来吧，Jo, 我们去看看能不能找到船员

所以这次 Ogrons 这次一露面，Jo 就能认出他们了)</i>

Take a look at that one.

You'll be all right now. I think...

Draconians! They're boarding!

I see. Having a fancy dress party? What happened?

- 那些龙...他们攻击了我们 - 是的，我们知道了

197
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:27,546
You say you're passengers.
Isn't that a little unusual on a cargo ship?
你说你们是乘客，这对于一艘货船来讲是不是有点不合常理啊?

198
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:29,060
Well, we're here, aren't we?
但是，我们现在就在这里，对不?

199

Where did you pick these two up?

I don't know. I can't seem to remember...

Pull yourself together! How did they get on board?

Stowaways... That's it, they were stowaways.

- They were sending messages. - That's right.

00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:43,323
They were helping the Dragons. They're traitors!
他们在帮助那些龙，他们是叛徒!

205
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,398
But that's absolute nonsense.
这绝对是胡说

206
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:47,876
Look, we didn't want to be on this ship. It was an accident.
是这样，我们并不想到这艘船上来的，是一次事故

207
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,639
You said you were passengers.

208
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:53,561
I was merely trying to avoid a lot of tiresome explanations, old chap.

00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:58,681
Lock them in the hold, put a guard on them.
把他们所进置留室，派人看着他们

212
00:11:58,807 --> 00:12:01,321
- But we haven't done anything. - They say you have. Take them away.
- 但我们没干过任何事啊 - 他们说你干过. 带走

213
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,442
Now, if you'll only listen to me...
诶，如果你能听我说...

214
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:03,562
You can talk to Earth Security.

Doctor, well, now the Ogrons have gone,
博士，对了，既然 Ograns 已经走了

220
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:29,527
why don't the crewmen remember what really happened?
为什么这些船员还是想不起来真正发生了什么?

221
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:32,326
Because the true facts have been erased from their minds, that's why.
因为真相已经从他们大脑里面抹掉了，这就是为什么

222
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:34,602
Well, yes, but why did they keep telling lies about us?
哦，这样，但为什么他们又一直说胡说八道呢?

223
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,518
Oh, they don't know that they're lying, Jo.
哦，他们并不知道他们在胡说八道，Jo

224
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:39,167
They're desperately trying to fit us into their version of things.
他们只是在尽力地把我们装进他们那个版本的真实中去

00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:41,477
Well, what are we going to do then?
那，我们该怎么办?

226

Well, when we get back to Earth,

we've got to reach someone in authority
whose mind isn't already closed.
我们应该能碰到某个当权者，他的大脑没有那么封闭?

228
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:47,675
Closed to what?
封闭?

229
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,200
Jo, look, these people believe
Jo, 你看，这些人相信

230
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:51,278
that the Draconians are attacking their spaceships, right?
是龙族人袭击了他们的飞船，对吧?

have created that hallucinatory device

235
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:00,801
that makes the Earthmen think they're Draconians.
可以让地球人产生错觉，以为是龙族人袭击了他们

236
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:03,526
Oh. Oh, well, that's simple then.
哦，哦，这样就简单了

237
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:07,202
I mean, what we've got to is find out what's going on,
我是说，我们要做的，就是搞明白到底是怎么一回事

谁在操纵这些 Ogrons, 他们又把 TARDIS 带到哪里去了

船上还有两个偷渡的人类，来源未知

I want a cordon around the landing area,
the minute that ship touches down.

Now then, what's all this about?

252
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:55,318
- Draconian agents? Are you sure? - What else can they be?
- 龙族特工? 你确定吗?   - 要不然还能是什么

253
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:56,840
Their story is obvious nonsense.

Why would the Draconians leave them on board the ship?

The Draconians are preparing for war.

The Draconians probably thought the crew was dead.

I'm going straight back to my ship.

Don't want to get mixed up with security.

00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:46,138
Under the powers invested in me by the Special Security Act,
根据特别安全法案授权于我的权力

417
00:22:46,227 --> 00:22:49,697
I'm sending you to the Lunar Penal Colony.
我现在发配你去月球刑事殖民地

418
00:22:49,787 --> 00:22:52,221
What, without a trial?
什么，不进行审判吗?

419
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:55,140
Without even a chance to state my case?
甚至都不给我一个陈述的机会?

420
00:22:56,827 --> 00:23:01,662
So, you're just tucking me quietly away, are you?
你们就这样把我悄悄地处理了，是吧?

421
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:04,298
What about my companion?
我的同伴会怎样?

422
00:23:04,387 --> 00:23:05,945
She will remain here.
她将留在这里

423
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:08,177
I have hopes that, away from your influence,
我还是有所期待，远离了你的影响

424
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:10,735
I might be able to make her see the error of her ways.
我也许能让她看明白她走错了路

425
00:23:10,827 --> 00:23:13,341
But you will see that she comes to no harm?
但你可否盯着点，让她免受伤害?

426
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:15,543
We are not barbarians.
我们不是野蛮人

427
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,106
If you want to help her,

00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,223
why don't you tell me where she comes from?

I'd like to inform her family.

00:23:21,507 --> 00:23:22,986
I'd like to, madam.
我也期望如此，夫人

00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:27,936
I really would, but there's nothing that I can say that you'd believe.
我真的这样，但确实我说不出什么你能相信的东西

432
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:29,861
May I say goodbye to her?
我可以跟她道个别吗?

433
00:23:29,947 --> 00:23:33,940
No! You'll be leaving immediately for the penal colony.
不，你要立刻出发去刑事殖民地

434
00:23:34,027 --> 00:23:38,100
We're putting you where your Draconian friends will be unable to reach you.
我们要把你放到你那些龙族朋友够不到你的地方

435
00:24:04,107 --> 00:24:06,701
Penny for them, Miss Grant?
想什么呢 (?)，Grant 小姐?

436
00:24:06,787 --> 00:24:10,177
You! What are you doing here?
你! 你在这里干什么?

00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:13,920
To coin a phrase, I've come to take you away from all this.

What are you talking about?

00:24:15,227 --> 00:24:17,546
Well, surely you don't want to spend the rest of your life in here, do you?
你当然不会期望在这里过完你的下半辈子，是吧?

440
00:24:17,627 --> 00:24:19,299
Well, I'm not going anywhere with you, that's for sure.
这是当然. 但我也不打算同你去任何地方

441
00:24:19,387 --> 00:24:21,139
Oh, but you are, you know.

442
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:22,296
Believe it or not,

I am a fully accredited commissioner from the planet Sirius 4

444
00:24:26,347 --> 00:24:28,622
and you and the Doctor are two dangerous criminals

445
00:24:28,707 --> 00:24:31,301
being handed over into my custody.

00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,059
So it was you!

You ordered those Ogrons to attack the ships

and pretend they were Draconians!

449
00:24:36,747 --> 00:24:37,862
But, of course!
不过，当然了

450
00:24:37,947 --> 00:24:39,665
Those lumbering idiots could never have thought up
那些愚蠢的家伙是无论如何也想不出

451
00:24:39,747 --> 00:24:42,022
such a brilliant scheme by themselves.

Why did you want to start a war?

Now, come on, Miss Grant, be reasonable.

You want to see the Doctor again, don't you?

458
00:24:56,427 --> 00:24:57,576
You don't.
你不知道

And the only way you'll find out is by coming with me.
唯一搞明白的方法就是跟我走

460
00:25:00,547 --> 00:25:01,662
Well?
怎样

461
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:02,975
(SIGHING)

462
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:08,227
How did you know we were here in the first place?

Well, after they'd attacked the cargo ships,
啊，当那些 Ogrons 攻击了那艘货船之后

the Ogrons returned to their planet, taking their loot with them.
他们带着战利品，回到自己的星球

465
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:17,659
Now imagine my surprise, and my delight,

00:25:17,747 --> 00:25:20,705
when I found that they brought me the Doctor's TARDIS.

468
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:23,900
Oh, need you ask?

How could I leave two dear friends in such dire straits?

Oh, you don't seriously think that

I'm going to believe that you want to help us...

Believe what you like, Miss Grant, I have my reasons.

Now, are you coming,
现在，你是跟着走呢?

474
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:37,262
or do you really wish to vegetate in
this hole for the rest of your natural?

The prisoner and I are ready to leave now, guard.

00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:50,457
Anywhere is better than here.

- Hello, Jo. - Doctor!

- How are you? All right? - Well...
- 你怎么样? 没事吧?  - 这个...

481

Right, they'll be plenty of time
for the exchange of social pleasantries.

Well, Doctor, this is an interesting reversal.
怎样，博士，这真是有趣的反转啊

485

I remember your once visiting me when I was in prison.

486
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:53,366
You know, I'd very much like to know why...

487
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:54,766
Why you've been locked up?

No, why I'm still alive.

Oh, come, your health is very precious to me, for the moment.
哦，得了，你的健康对我来说很珍贵的，至少目前是

You see, my employers are most interested in you.
要知道，我的雇主对你非常有兴趣

491

- The Ogrons? - Miss Grant, please! I employ them.
- 是 Ogrons?  - Grant 小姐，是我雇佣他们好不

Yes, well, whatever it is you're up to,
you needn't expect any help from me.

494
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:17,161
Your simple presence will be quite enough.
你们只要出现就完全够了

495
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:21,201
Oh, by the way, I need hardly warn you
there is no point in trying to escape.
哦，对了，不需要我警告你吧，企图在这里逃跑完全没意义

496
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:23,198
This is an interplanetary police spaceship,
这是一艘星际警用飞船

497
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:26,040
specially built for carrying prisoners, as you can see.

Stolen, of course?

499
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:30,438
(SCOFFING) Of course. Oh, and another thing...
当然. 哦，还有一件事

500
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:34,119
There's a closed-circuit television
camera trained on you from up there,
这里有一个闭路电视摄像头，对准了你

501
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:36,767
so you will be under continuous observation.

502
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:38,166
I think that's all.
差不多就是这些了

00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:40,761
Well, now, if you'll excuse me,
现在，如果没有什么事情

00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:43,236
I have some rather complicated
astro-navigational calculations to work out.

May I ask where we're going?

on the remote fringes of the galaxy.

508
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:54,525
Why are you taking us there?
你为什么带我去那里?

509
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:57,917
That, Miss Grant, you will discover when you arrive.
这个，Grant 小姐，你到了就知道了

510
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,397
Right, now listen to me. We haven't got much time

511
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:06,125
before he gets back to the flight deck.
要赶在他回到飞行舱之前

512
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,562
Now, the first thing we've got to do is to escape.
现在第一件事我们要做的事情是逃脱

513
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,002
Now, they took my sonic screwdriver from me in the prison
在监狱的时候他们把我的音速起子给拿走了

514
00:28:11,087 --> 00:28:13,555
but they didn't get a hold of this.
不过他们没发现这个

515
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:16,764
- A steel file.   - Right, let's go.
- 一把锉刀?   - 对，我们开始

516
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:18,997
No, not yet. Let's wait till he gets back to the flight deck,
不，还不行. 先等他回到飞行舱

517
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:22,397
then he'll set the controls. Now, this is an automatic spaceship.
等他设定好控制，飞船就进入自动巡航状态了

518
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:24,842
Once we're underway, the computers take over, right?
等我们一启程，电脑就完全接管了，对吧

519
00:28:24,927 --> 00:28:26,883
-Okay, so what's the plan?
-Now this is what we're gonna do.
- 好了，计划是什么  - 我们接下来要这样

520
00:28:52,427 --> 00:28:54,497
<i>So I told the High Council of the Time Lords,</i>
于是我就告诉时间领主最高理事会

521
00:28:54,587 --> 00:28:58,466
<i>I said they had absolutely no right</i>
<i>to put me on trial in the first place.</i>
我说他们一开始就完全无权让我受审

522
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:01,345
Well, if I chose to go wandering around the universe in my own time,
就是说，如果我自己决定要用我自己的时间去宇宙里四处逛逛

523
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:02,496
that was my business.
那是我自己的事情

524
00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:04,179
What about stealing the TARDIS?
那偷 TARDIS 的事情怎么说?

525
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:06,861
I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it.
我没偷，我是借走的

526
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:09,177
I fully intended to return it, I assure you.
我本来就打算还回去的，我向你保证

527
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:11,178
Anyway, she wasn't exactly the latest model, poor old thing.
再说了，它也不是最新的型号，可怜的老古董

528
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,144
JO: (LAUGHING) You can say that again.
你又说这个

529
00:29:13,227 --> 00:29:15,866
I tell you, I made a complete fool of that prosecuting council, though.

I ridiculed his every argument.

Yes, and I told him that I had the complete answer

532
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,946
to every one his charges against me.
对于他指控我的每一条

533
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,426
JO: And then what happened?
然后发生了什么

534
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:26,180
DOCTOR: Then what happened, well, they found me guilty,
然后发生了什么，这个，他们说我有罪

535
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:28,986
changed my appearance and exiled me to Earth.
改变了我的外形，把我流放到了地球

536
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,705
JO: And that's where you met me!
就是你碰见我的地方!

537
00:29:30,787 --> 00:29:33,460
<i>That's right. That's where I met you.</i>
对，就是我碰见你的地方

538
00:29:33,547 --> 00:29:35,902
<i>And that alone made the exile worthwhile, Miss Grant.</i>
单单这个就让这次流放变得有价值了，Grant 小姐

539
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:37,136
JO: <i>Thank you!</i>
谢谢你!

540
00:29:37,227 --> 00:29:38,945
<i>Not that there's anything wrong with Earth.</i>
不过地球本身也没有什么问题

541
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,541
<i>Well, it's quite a nice, little planet in its own way, but...</i>
嗯，它很不错，小小的星球，有自己的风格，不过...

542
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:45,302
<i>After all, I am a Time Lord, Jo,</i>
<i>and I think I've deserve my freedom.</i>
毕竟，我是一个时间领主，Jo, 我想我应该享有我的自由

-In reminiscent mood, are you, Doctor?
- 对啊   - 又想忆苦思甜了，是吗，博士?

544
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:50,856
Poor Miss Grant, you have my deepest sympathy.
可怜的 Grant 小姐，我对你深表同情

545
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:52,300
(CHUCKLING)

546
00:30:00,947 --> 00:30:03,222
As I soon realised, the trouble with Lethbridge-Stewart
我很快就发现，Lethbridge-Stewart 准将的问题是

547
00:30:03,307 --> 00:30:04,706
is that he's got a military mind.
他始终是军人的思维

548
00:30:04,787 --> 00:30:07,824
Well, he is a brigadier, after all. I mean, what do you expect?
但是，毕竟他是一个准将啊. 我是说，你还想他怎么样?

549
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:08,976
No, that's just the trouble though.
不，那还只是问题的开始

550
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:12,423
He's hidebound, you see. He always does everything by the rules.
他很死板，你明白吗. 他总是按照规则来做事情

551
00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:14,179
I keep telling him. I said, "There are times, you know,
我一直跟他说: "有些时候啊，

552
00:30:14,267 --> 00:30:16,701
"when you've simply got to cut right through the red tape."
你就得抛弃那些繁文缛节

553
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:18,743
And you've managed to do that, have you?
你就真这样做了，是吗

554
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:22,058
DOCTOR: Yes, I've managed to cut right through it.
是的，我就抛掉这些东西

555
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:27,946
And I'm not going to let authority stand between me and my freedom.
我可不打算让当局挡住我去追求自由

556
00:30:28,347 --> 00:30:32,420
(SIGHING) Lethbridge-Stewart, I...
Lethbridge-Stewart, 我...

557
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:37,183
Hey! As far as he's concerned
I've been absent without leave all this time.
说到他，我还没有跟他请假就离开了

558
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:39,297
I'm always telling people ...
我一直跟人说...

559
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:48,061
Is everything all right, Miss Grant?

560
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,097
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

561
00:30:51,427 --> 00:30:54,624
And how about you, Doctor?
No ill effects, I hope?

562
00:30:56,347 --> 00:30:58,383
Doctor, are you all right?

563
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:01,984
JO: <i>Please don't wake him.</i>

564
00:31:02,747 --> 00:31:07,867
Is he? How very relaxed of him.

565
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:10,262
you come with me, Miss Grant.

566
00:31:11,427 --> 00:31:12,746
Come on!

567
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:21,937
Right, in you go, Miss Grant.

568
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,098
Can you hear me, Doctor?

569
00:31:34,347 --> 00:31:37,862
<i>Are you on the flight deck?</i>
<i>If so, listen to this.</i>

570
00:31:38,707 --> 00:31:40,937
<i>Miss Grant is in the air lock.</i>

571
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,865
Unless you surrender yourself
to me immediately,

572
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:49,303
I shall open the outer door
and hurl her into space.

573
00:31:53,587 --> 00:31:56,420
What an ingenious fellow
you are, Doctor!

574
00:31:57,147 --> 00:31:59,183
Oh, no, you don't!

575
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:03,342
Now hold it, Doctor, hold it!

576
00:32:04,227 --> 00:32:06,661
Get that blaster over to me
or I press this button,

577
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:09,420
and that will be the end of Miss Grant!

578
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:18,179
(DOCTOR EXCLAIMING)

579
00:32:26,547 --> 00:32:27,775
Thank you, Doctor.

580
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:29,778
(THUDDING)

581
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:32,876
Well, we appear to have company.

582
00:32:39,387 --> 00:32:41,742
Would these be your Ogron friends?

583
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:43,226
Why, no, no.

584
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:47,659
Well, I should try and be
a bit more hospitable, old chap.

585
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:51,740
Come on, put that gun away.
They've probably got us outnumbered.

586
00:32:56,147 --> 00:32:59,378
Welcome on board my ship.
To what do I owe the honour?

587
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:02,379
Why have you violated
the Draconian frontier?

588
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:06,016
Uh, yes, I'm most apologetic about that,
but it was really beyond my control.

589
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:08,575
You see, my prisoners
were trying to escape and my...

590
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,897
-My ship was thrown off course.
-Prisoners?

591
00:33:10,987 --> 00:33:13,455
Yes, I am the commissioner
of Earth's Interplanetary Police.

592
00:33:13,547 --> 00:33:17,142
I'm taking these two people back
to planet Sirius 4 for...for trial.

593
00:33:17,227 --> 00:33:18,819
Uh, here is my warrant of authority.

594
00:33:18,907 --> 00:33:21,023
Now, don't believe this man, he's lying.

595
00:33:21,107 --> 00:33:24,224
I'm not concerned in disputes
between Earthmen.

596
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:27,461
We shall take them to Draconia.
Put them in the cage.

597
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,662
But you can't do that!

598
00:33:28,747 --> 00:33:30,146
I'm a commissioner
of Interplanetary Police!

599
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:33,105
This is my spaceship!
I tell you, you can't do that!

600
00:33:45,227 --> 00:33:48,617
Well, personally I'm quite happy
to be going to Draconia, Jo.

601
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:50,060
Perhaps we can convince the Emperor

602
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:51,785
what our friend here
has been trying to do.

603
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:53,937
You really think he'd believe you?

604
00:33:54,027 --> 00:33:56,700
Well, this won't be my first visit
to Draconia, you know?

605
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:59,460
Many years ago,
I spent quite some time there.

606
00:33:59,547 --> 00:34:02,220
I was able to help them through a period
of very great difficulty.

607
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:04,917
So there's a good chance
that they'll believe you, huh?

608
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:07,316
Well, it was a long time ago.
Things may have changed.

609
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:09,318
But I do understand
the Draconian mentality, Jo.

610
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:11,045
It all depends how you approach them.

611
00:34:11,127 --> 00:34:14,437
So, if they do believe the Doctor,
you've had it!

612
00:34:14,527 --> 00:34:16,722
Perhaps, Miss Grant, perhaps.

613
00:34:16,927 --> 00:34:19,964
But one never knows
when help may be at hand.

614
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:22,402
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I think that this is going to be

615
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:26,765
rather a long journey,
so, uh, good night.

616
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:30,076
We'll wake you with a cup of tea
in the morning.

1
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:11,439
- Hello, Jo. - Doctor!
- 嘿, Jo  - 博士!

2
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,918
- How are you? All right? - Well...
- 你怎么样? 没事吧?  - 这个...

3
00:26:17,007 --> 00:26:19,885
Right, they'll be plenty of time
for the exchange of social pleasantries.
好啦, 他们有足够的时间来嘘寒问暖

4
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:21,480
Put him inside.
把他关进去

5
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:39,923
Thank you, gentlemen. You can leave them to me now.
谢谢你们, 先生们. 你们可以把他们俩留给我了

6
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:47,556
Well, Doctor, this is an interesting reversal.
怎样, 博士, 这真是有趣的反转啊

7
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,798
I remember your once visiting me when I was in prison.
我记得有一次我在监狱里面你还来探访

8
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:53,366
You know, I'd very much like to know why...
你知道吗, 我倒是很想知道为什么...

9
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:54,766
Why you've been locked up?
为什么你被锁起来了?

10
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,486
No, why I'm still alive.
不, 为什么我还活着

11
00:26:57,687 --> 00:27:02,522
Oh, come, your health is very precious to me, for the moment.
哦, 得了, 你的健康对我来说很珍贵的, 至少目前是

12
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:06,085
You see, my employers are most interested in you.
要知道, 我的雇主对你非常有兴趣

13
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:10,126
- The Ogrons? - Miss Grant, please! I employ them.
- 是 Ogrons?  - Grant 小姐, 是我雇佣他们好不

14
00:27:10,207 --> 00:27:13,085
Yes, well, whatever it is you're up to,
you needn't expect any help from me.
好吧, 不管你的图谋是什么, 别想从我这里得到帮助

15
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,646
I don't need any help.
我不需要任何帮助

16
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:17,161
Your simple presence will be quite enough.
你们只要出现就完全够了

17
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:21,201
Oh, by the way, I need hardly warn you
there is no point in trying to escape.
哦, 对了, 不需要我警告你吧, 企图在这里逃跑完全没意义

18
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:23,198
This is an interplanetary police spaceship,
这是一艘星际警用飞船

19
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:26,040
specially built for carrying prisoners, as you can see.
专为运送囚犯建造的, 你可以看得出来

20
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:27,196
Stolen, of course?
偷来的, 对吧?

21
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:30,438
(SCOFFING) Of course. Oh, and another thing...
当然. 哦, 还有一件事

22
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:34,119
There's a closed-circuit television
camera trained on you from up there,
这里有一个闭路电视摄像头, 对准了你

23
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:36,767
so you will be under continuous observation.
所以你在我的持续监视之下

24
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:38,166
I think that's all.
差不多就是这些了

25
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:40,761
Well, now, if you'll excuse me,/
现在, 如果没有什么事情

26
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:43,236
I have some rather complicated
astro-navigational calculations to work out.
我还要去做一些复杂的航天导航计算

27
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:45,045
May I ask where we're going?
我能问问我们要去哪儿吗?

28
00:27:45,127 --> 00:27:48,756
Certainly. To the home of our friends, the Ogrons.
当然可以, 去我们朋友的家乡, 那些 Ogrons 的

29
00:27:49,287 --> 00:27:52,802
A barren and uninteresting planet
on the remote fringes of the galaxy.
一颗贫瘠而无趣的星球, 在遥远的星系边缘

30
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:54,525
Why are you taking us there?
你为什么带我去那里?

31
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:57,917
That, Miss Grant, you will discover when you arrive.
这个, Grant 小姐, 你到了就知道了

32
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:04,397
Right, now listen to me. We haven't got much time
好了, 现在听我说, 我们没有太多时间

33
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:06,125
before he gets back to the flight deck.
要赶在他回到飞行舱之前

34
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,562
Now, the first thing we've got to do is to escape.
现在第一件事我们要做的事情是逃脱

35
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,002
Now, they took my sonic screwdriver from me in the prison
在监狱的时候他们把我的音速起子给拿走了

36
00:28:11,087 --> 00:28:13,555
but they didn't get a hold of this.
不过他们没发现这个

37
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:16,764
- A steel file.   - Right, let's go.
- 一把锉刀?   - 对, 我们开始

38
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:18,997
No, not yet. Let's wait till he gets back to the flight deck,
不, 还不行. 先等他回到飞行舱

39
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:22,397
then he'll set the controls. Now, this is an automatic spaceship.
等他设定好控制, 飞船就进入自动巡航状态了

40
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:24,842
Once we're underway, the computers take over, right?
等我们一启程, 电脑就完全接管了, 对吧

41
00:28:24,927 --> 00:28:26,883
-Okay, so what's the plan?
-Now this is what we're gonna do.
- 好了, 计划是什么  - 我们接下来要这样

42
00:28:52,427 --> 00:28:54,497
<i>So I told the High Council of the Time Lords,</i>
于是我就告诉时间领主最高理事会

43
00:28:54,587 --> 00:28:58,466
<i>I said they had absolutely no right</i>
<i>to put me on trial in the first place.</i>
我说他们一开始就完全无权让我受审

44
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:01,345
Well, if I chose to go wandering around the universe in my own time,
就是说, 如果我自己决定要用我自己的时间去宇宙里四处逛逛

45
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:02,496
that was my business.
那是我自己的事情

46
00:29:02,587 --> 00:29:04,179
What about stealing the TARDIS?
那偷 TARDIS 的事情怎么说?

47
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:06,861
I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it.
我没偷, 我是借走的

48
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:09,177
I fully intended to return it, I assure you.
我本来就打算还回去的, 我向你保证

49
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:11,178
Anyway, she wasn't exactly the latest model, poor old thing.
再说了, 它也不是最新的型号, 可怜的老古董

50
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,144
JO: (LAUGHING) You can say that again.
你又说这个

51
00:29:13,227 --> 00:29:15,866
I tell you, I made a complete fool of that prosecuting council, though.
我跟你说, 我把他们检察委员会从头到尾给耍了

52
00:29:15,947 --> 00:29:18,142
I ridiculed his every argument.
我把他的每句话都驳倒了

53
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:20,377
Yes, and I told him that I had the complete answer
是的, 我跟他说我全有理由

54
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,946
to every one his charges against me.
对于他指控我的每一条

55
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,426
JO: And then what happened?
然后发生了什么

56
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:26,180
DOCTOR: Then what happened, well, they found me guilty,
然后发生了什么, 这个, 他们说我有罪

57
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:28,986
changed my appearance and exiled me to Earth.
改变了我的外形, 把我流放到了地球

58
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,705
JO: And that's where you met me!
就是你碰见我的地方!

59
00:29:30,787 --> 00:29:33,460
<i>That's right. That's where I met you.</i>
对, 就是我碰见你的地方

60
00:29:33,547 --> 00:29:35,902
<i>And that alone made the exile worthwhile, Miss Grant.</i>
单单这个就让这次流放变得有价值了, Grant 小姐

61
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:37,136
JO: <i>Thank you!</i>
谢谢你!

62
00:29:37,227 --> 00:29:38,945
<i>Not that there's anything wrong with Earth.</i>
不过地球本身也没有什么问题

63
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,541
<i>Well, it's quite a nice, little planet in its own way, but...</i>
嗯, 它很不错, 小小的星球, 有自己的风格, 不过...

64
00:29:41,627 --> 00:29:45,302
<i>After all, I am a Time Lord, Jo,</i>
<i>and I think I've deserve my freedom.</i>
毕竟, 我是一个时间领主, Jo, 我想我应该享有我的自由

65
00:29:45,387 --> 00:29:48,459
-JO: <i>Right!</i>
-In reminiscent mood, are you, Doctor?
对啊, 又在回忆了, 是吗, 博士?

66
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:50,856
Poor Miss Grant, you have my deepest sympathy.
可怜的 Grant 小姐, 我对你深表同情

67
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:52,300
(CHUCKLING)

68
00:30:00,947 --> 00:30:03,222
As I soon realised, the trouble with Lethbridge-Stewart
我很快就发现, Lethbridge-Stewart 准将的问题是

69
00:30:03,307 --> 00:30:04,706
is that he's got a military mind.
他始终是军人的思维

70
00:30:04,787 --> 00:30:07,824
Well, he is a brigadier, after all. I mean, what do you expect?
但是, 毕竟他是一个准将啊. 我是说, 你还想他怎么样?

71
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:08,976
No, that's just the trouble though.
不, 那还只是问题的开始

72
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:12,423
He's hidebound, you see. He always does everything by the rules.
他很死板, 你明白吗. 他总是按照规则来做事情

73
00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:14,179
I keep telling him. I said, "There are times, you know,
我一直跟他说: "有些时候啊, 

74
00:30:14,267 --> 00:30:16,701
"when you've simply got to cut right through the red tape."
你就得抛弃那些繁文缛节

75
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:18,743
And you've managed to do that, have you?
你就真这样做了, 是吗

76
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:22,058
DOCTOR: Yes, I've managed to cut right through it.
是的, 我就抛掉这些东西

77
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:27,946
And I'm not going to let authority stand between me and my freedom.
我可不打算让当局挡住我去追求自由

78
00:30:28,347 --> 00:30:32,420
(SIGHING) Lethbridge-Stewart, I...
Lethbridge-Stewart, 我...

79
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:37,183
Hey! As far as he's concerned
I've been absent without leave all this time.
说到他, 我还没有跟他请假就离开了

80
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:39,297
I'm always telling people ...

I shall open the outer door
and hurl her into space.

To what do I owe the honour?

Why have you violated
the Draconian frontier?

啊，是，我对此非常抱歉。不过情况真的超出了我的控制

to be going to Draconia, Jo.

what our friend here has been trying to do.

Well, this won't be my first visit
to Draconia, you know?
哦，这也不是我第一次去龙帝国，你知道不？

Many years ago,
I spent quite some time there.

the Draconian mentality, Jo.

It all depends how you approach them.

9
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:26,203
Surely, now you will declare war
upon the Earthmen?

Let me lead your battle fleets
to crush their...

They too, have battle fleets, my Son.

It'll take him a long time
to talk himself out of that one.
可得要些时间他才能说明白，再脱开身

But he'll get to see the President,

She won't believe him.

is going to believe the word of a Draconian?

And, with respect, there is still no concrete evidence.
而且，恕我直言，它并没有可靠证据支撑

I myself would like to believe you
but, as you can see,

I need proof to convince my people.

The proof we need is there, madam.

00:47:15,547 --> 00:47:17,617
into such a pointless expedition?

their forces to attack you.

I don't think so. There's too much distrust between them.

263
00:47:50,787 --> 00:47:52,345
The Doctor will find you, eventually.

(SIGHING) If only we had proof.

他之前把坐标输入到飞船电脑里面了，那会儿我还是他的俘虏

And after you'd captured the ship, sir,

I extracted the information
from the ship's memory banks.

从飞船的大小来看, 他们的力量不可能太强
