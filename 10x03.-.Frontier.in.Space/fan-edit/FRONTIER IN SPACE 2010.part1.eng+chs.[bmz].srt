We're going to meet your friends.

- Come on! Get up there! - Come on, they're almost through.
- 快点, 上这里来! - 快点, 他们快打穿了

00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,806
HARDY: Get in front! If your friends start shooting,
they'll get you first.
站前面去! 如果你的朋友们开始开枪, 先射死的是你们

- But they're not our friends! - You are part of their boarding party.
- 但他们不是我们的朋友! - 你们俩是他们登船小队的成员

147
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:27,877
They haven't boarded yet. They're still breaking through that door.
他们还没有登船. 他们还在切割舱门呢

148
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:30,435
- Now, try and be logical, man. - They're coming through!
- 能不能讲点理, 伙计 - 他们过来了

- Ogrons!  - 快回到 TARDIS, Jo. 回去!

150
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:41,717
Doctor! Doctor!
博士, 博士!

151
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:54,485
JO: (SOFTLY) Doctor?
博士?

152
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:00,761
- Jo? - JO: Doctor!

00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:06,520
- Jo? - JO: Doctor, I'm over here.
- Jo? - 博士, 我在这里

154
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,603
All right, Jo, what are you doing in there?

155
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:20,643
Oh, Doctor, thank goodness, you're all right.
哦, 博士, 感谢神灵, 你没事

I thought they'd killed you.

157
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,564
Come on, come and sit down.
来吧, 过来坐下

158
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:33,005
Must have been some kind of neuronic stun gun.
肯定是某种中子击晕枪

159
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:37,715
I wonder why they didn't kill me? What exactly happened, Jo?
很奇怪他们为什么没杀了我? 到底发生了什么, Jo?

160
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:40,924
Well, they took the cargo, threw me in here and...
呃..他们把货拿走了, 然后把我扔到这里面就...

161
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:42,520
- Doctor? - Hmm?
- 博士 - 唔?

162
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:46,236
- They also took the TARDIS. - Oh...
- 他们还带走了 TARDIS - 噢...

163
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:50,320
Oh, we're stranded. What are we going to do?
哦, 我们陷入困境了. 现在怎么办?

Well, try and get the TARDIS back, of course.
当然是想办法把 TARDIS 弄回来

165
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:53,156
(JO SIGHS)

166
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:55,522
Why should the Ogrons attack this ship?
为什么 Ogrons 要攻击这艘船?

167
00:09:55,607 --> 00:10:00,078
- To steal the cargo. - No. No, there's more to it than that.
- 为了偷货呗 - 不, 不, 远不仅于此

168
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:05,237
That... That sound that you heard,
那个...你听到的那个声音

169
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:08,478
it's all too sophisticated for the Ogrons.
对于 Ogrons 来说过于复杂了

170
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,684
- Well, they're gone now. - Yeah, the question is, where?
- 他们现在已经走了 - 对, 但问题是, 去了哪儿?

171
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:14,801
Hey, Doctor, last time we met the Ogrons
嘿, 博士, 上一次我们碰到 Ogrons 的时候

172
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:16,878
they were working for the Daleks, right?
他们在为 Daleks 卖命, 对不?

173
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:20,039
- Well, you don't suppose that that... - No, no, not necessarily.
- 这, 你不是想说... - 不, 不, 不一定

174
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:22,595
No, the Ogrons are mercenaries.
不, 这些 Ogrons 都是雇佣兵

175
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:25,520
Other life forms use them to do their dirty work.
其他的种族会用他们来干些脏活

176
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:29,320
Come on, Jo, let's go and find the crew.
来吧, Jo, 我们去看看能不能找到船员

177
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:33,801
<i>(博士与 Jo 上一次碰到 Ogrons 是在09x01 The Day of the Daleks 这集,
所以这次 Ogrons 这次一露面, Jo 就能认出他们了)</i>

178
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:44,598
Take a look at that one.
你看一下那个

179
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,157
DOCTOR: It's all right, Jo. We're being rescued.
没事了, Jo. 我们得救了

180
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,566
- What happened? - Well, don't worry, old chap.
- 发生了什么? - 别担心, 老伙计

181
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,008
You'll be all right now. I think...
你很快就没事了, 我想...

182
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:02,062
Draconians! They're boarding!

- Stewart? Who are you? - Passengers.

184
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:11,098
I see. Having a fancy dress party? What happened?

185
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:13,621
- Dragons attacked us. - Did they get the cargo?
- 那些龙袭击了我们 - 他们劫走货物了没

187
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,782
Including some rather valuable property of mine.
包括我个人的一些相当值钱的东西

188
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:21,064
- Well, tough luck. - Oh, thank you very much.
- 这样啊, 挺倒霉啊 - 哦, 很感谢你们

189
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:24,742
- Dragons... They attacked us. - Yes, we know.
- 那些龙...他们攻击了我们 - 是的, 我们知道了

190
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:27,546
You say you're passengers.
Isn't that a little unusual on a cargo ship?
你说你们是乘客, 这对于一艘货船来讲是不是有点不合常理啊?

191
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:29,060
Well, we're here, aren't we?
但是, 我们现在就在这里, 对不?

192
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,739
Where did you pick these two up?
你们在哪里捎带上他们俩的?

193
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,385
I don't know. I can't seem to remember...
我不知道, 好像想不起来了...

194
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:34,856
Pull yourself together! How did they get on board?
站好了! 他们是怎么上船的?

195
00:11:35,507 --> 00:11:38,704
Stowaways... That's it, they were stowaways.
偷渡的... 对了, 他们是偷渡的

196
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:40,796
- They were sending messages. - That's right.
- 他们曾经往外发送信息 - 那就对了

197
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:44,323
They were helping the Dragons. They're traitors!
他们在帮助那些龙, 他们是叛徒!
