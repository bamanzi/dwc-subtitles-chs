2
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,398
But that's absolute nonsense.

3
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:47,876
Look, we didn't want to be on this ship. It was an accident.

4
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,639
You said you were passengers.

5
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:53,561
I was merely trying to avoid a lot of tiresome explanations, old chap.

6
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:56,207
Stewart, I'll leave Kemp on board to take your ship back to Earth.

7
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,322
What about these two?

8
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:58,681
Lock them in the hold, put a guard on them.

9
00:11:58,807 --> 00:12:01,321
- But we haven't done anything. - They say you have. Take them away.

10
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,442
Now, if you'll only listen to me...

11
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:03,562
You can talk to Earth Security.

12
00:12:03,647 --> 00:12:04,716
They'll listen, it's their business.

13
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,436
- Put them in the starboard cubicle. - All right, get moving.

14
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:13,999
In there.

15
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,956
Oops. No need to push.

16
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:26,885
Doctor, well, now the Ogrons have gone,

17
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:29,527
why don't the crewmen remember what really happened?

18
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:32,326
Because the true facts have been erased from their minds, that's why.

19
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:34,602
Well, yes, but why did they keep telling lies about us?

20
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,518
Oh, they don't know that they're lying, Jo.

21
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:39,167
They're desperately trying to fit us into their version of things.

22
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:41,477
Well, what are we going to do then?

23
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:43,080
Well, when we get back to Earth,

24
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:46,364
we've got to reach someone in authority
whose mind isn't already closed.

25
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:47,675
Closed to what?

26
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,200
Jo, look, these people believe

27
00:12:49,287 --> 00:12:51,278
that the Draconians are attacking their spaceships, right?

28
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,039
- Right. - We know that they're wrong, don't we?

29
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:54,446
Well, yes, it was Ogrons.

30
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:56,279
Oh, we also know that the Ogrons couldn't possibly

31
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:58,198
have created that hallucinatory device

32
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:00,801
that makes the Earthmen think they're Draconians.

33
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:03,526
Oh. Oh, well, that's simple then.

34
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:07,202
I mean, what we've got to is find out what's going on,

35
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,597
who's behind the Ogrons, where they've taken the TARDIS,

36
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:13,247
go and get it back and then we can all go home.

37
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:14,840
- Right? - Right.

38
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:18,124
Oh. I don't know what I've been worrying about.

39
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:21,477
<i>We are now in space port 10.</i>

40
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,958
<i>The ship will land in 15 minutes. The crew are safe.</i>

41
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:29,801
<i>Also aboard, two human stowaways, origins unknown.</i>

42
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:32,560
I want a cordon around the landing area,
the minute that ship touches down.

43
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:34,365
Nobody on, nobody off till I get there.

44
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,482
<i>Sir.</i>

45
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:38,859
I'd better get down there.
I want handle the preliminary interrogations myself.

46
00:13:40,507 --> 00:13:43,146
- Outside. - We want to see somebody in authority.

47
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:45,457
You're going to, but outside.

48
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:51,338
Now then, what's all this about?

49
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:55,318
- Draconian agents? Are you sure? - What else can they be?

50
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:56,840
Their story is obvious nonsense.

51
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:58,679
But why? We...

52
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:00,678
Why would the Draconians leave them on board the ship?

53
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:03,122
The Draconians are preparing for war.

54
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:05,596
You're still only suspecting that. There is no proof.

55
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:07,439
Then they need to plant human agents,

56
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:10,405
traitors, on this planet to sabotage our war effort.

57
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:13,081
But we are bound to suspect them. They must have realised.

58
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:16,045
The Draconians probably thought the crew was dead.

59
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:18,038
We could easily have accepted those two as passengers,

60
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:21,278
two unfortunate refugees from a Draconian attack,

61
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,865
- When did you last eat? - Quite some while ago.

62
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:31,744
Well, I'll see they send you some food.

63
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:34,216
I'd like to get a message through to your president.

64
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,820
Not a chance.

65
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:37,022
I'm going straight back to my ship.

66
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:38,335
Don't want to get mixed up with security.

67
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:40,145
It's not healthy.

68
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:44,426
- Look, I'll give you a piece of advice. - DOCTOR: Yes?

69
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:47,977
Sooner or later, you're going to tell them everything.

70
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,818
They'll use the mind probe. You talk to them now.

71
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:55,500
You'll save yourselves a lot of trouble.

72
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:02,779
PRESIDENT: And you are quite sure it was a Draconian battle cruiser.

73
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:03,902
Of course, Madam.

74
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,500
They locked on and boarded us.

75
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:08,101
We saw them. They were Draconians.

76
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:11,064
Thank you. That will be all.

77
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:14,139
I hope you will soon recover from your ordeal.

78
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:21,186
Well, Your Highness?

79
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:23,303
These men are your servants.

80
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:26,220
They are saying what they have been ordered to say.

81
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:29,538
On this occasion, we have more than our servants to confront you with.

82
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:31,265
We have captured two of your human agents.

83
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,303
We have no human agents.

84
00:15:33,427 --> 00:15:36,419
Subversion and espionage are expressly forbidden

85
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:38,941
by the treaty of peace between our two empires.

86
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:41,336
A treaty which you have flagrantly broken.

87
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:43,224
I shall return to my embassy.

88
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:46,663
Just a moment please, Your Highness. Bring them in.

89
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:54,306
These people stowed away on the cargo ship.

90
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,581
They transmitted signals

91
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:58,340
which enabled your battle cruiser to home in on its prey.

92
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:00,258
I know nothing of this.

93
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:04,545
Perhaps you do not, but some servant of the Draconian empire employed them.

94
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:08,742
Madam, I can assure that I've never been employed by anybody.

95
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,778
Least of all by the Draconians.

96
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:14,780
Your servants should have been better rehearsed in their lies.

97
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:18,064
Or they're showing a misguided loyalty to their Draconian masters.

98
00:16:18,147 --> 00:16:19,944
If we really were working for the Draconians,

99
00:16:20,027 --> 00:16:21,301
why did they leave us in your ship?

100
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:24,618
To act as spies when you were brought back to Earth.

101
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:26,937
Allow me to congratulate you, sir.

102
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,939
You have the most totally closed mind that I've ever encountered.

103
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:32,143
Madam, I beg of you to listen to me.

104
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:35,742
Some third party is trying to provoke war between Earth and Draconia.

105
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:36,942
You are both being duped.

106
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:38,142
Take them away.

107
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:39,455
Just a minute, please.

108
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:40,821
Why should a third party wish to do this?

109
00:16:40,907 --> 00:16:41,976
I've no idea, Madam,

110
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,386
but believe me, that is what is happening.

111
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:44,582
Take them away.

112
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,259
Now please listen to me! If you don't

113
00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:50,977
you'll be involved in a war that could cause the death of millions.

114
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:56,856
Is this the evidence upon which you accuse me?

115
00:16:57,507 --> 00:17:00,624
I must ask you to convey a formal protest to your Emperor.

116
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:05,986
I shall inform him of this latest insult
to the honour of the Draconian empire.

117
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:18,155
But why?

118
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:22,157
Why should they produce such an elaborate lie?

119
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:28,000
The ways of the Earthmen are devious. They're an inscrutable species.

120
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:33,036
Obviously, they are preparing the next stage of their plan.

121
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:38,197
First, the attacks on our ships and now this.

122
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:43,563
Is it possible, Your Highness,
that for once the Earthmen spoke the truth?

123
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:47,925
Some plan of the Emperor of which Your Highness has not been informed?

124
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:51,443
The Emperor would not possibly contemplate such a plan.

125
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:54,087
We do not break the treaty of peace.

126
00:17:57,287 --> 00:18:01,678
Shall I prepare your Excellency's report
to the Emperor on this meeting?

127
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,596
I must have more information.

128
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:11,404
It would be useful to question the humans who were found on the ship.

129
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:16,236
They are supposed to be prisoners.

130
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:21,075
Prisoners have been known to escape, Your Highness.

131
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,205
Not without help.

132
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,759
And that would be a grave act of hostility.

133
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:30,205
I could not possibly countenance such a plan.

134
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:39,922
But, should two escaping prisoners seek sanctuary in this embassy,

135
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:44,759
it would be uncivilised to turn them away.

136
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:52,155
I must not detain you longer.

137
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:57,437
No doubt you have duties demanding your attention?
