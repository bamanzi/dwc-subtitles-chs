We know this man is a Draconian agent. He must be lying.

Perhaps he's already been brainwashed, sir.

I've been telling you the truth for some considerable time

I can't think why you chose to work for the Draconians.

But whatever it is, I'll double any offer they've made to you.

That's very generous of you, madam,

What, without a trial?

79

I'd like to, madam.

111

Why did you want to start a war?

113

Now, come on, Miss Grant, be reasonable.

114
00:24:47,947 --> 00:24:49,778
You want to see the Doctor again, don't you?

115
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:52,335
- Where is he? - He's in another prison, on the Moon.

We're going to collect him.

118
00:24:56,427 --> 00:24:57,576
You don't.

119
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:00,465

the Ogrons returned to their planet, taking their loot with them.

126
00:25:17,747 --> 00:25:20,705
when I found that they brought me the Doctor's TARDIS.

127
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,459

Oh, need you ask?

129
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:27,024
How could I leave two dear friends in such dire straits?

130
00:25:27,107 --> 00:25:28,540
Oh, you don't seriously think that

131
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:29,821

132
00:25:29,907 --> 00:25:32,023
Believe what you like, Miss Grant, I have my reasons.

133
00:25:32,107 --> 00:25:33,506
Now, are you coming,

134
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:37,262
or do you really wish to vegetate in
this hole for the rest of your natural?

Very well. I'll come.
