Hello, battle cruiser, battle cruiser,
this is the cargo ship. Over.

10
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:06,199
<i>What is your situation?</i>

11
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:09,723
The ship has been attacked
and the cargo stolen. Over.

12
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:11,445
<i>Do you have casualties?</i>

13
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:14,724
Yes, the crew are stunned
but otherwise they're unharmed. Over.

DOCTOR: It's all right, Jo.
We're being rescued.

16
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,321
-What happened?
-Now don't worry, old chap.

17
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:36,556
You'll be all right.

18
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:38,638
Draconians! They're boarding!

19
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:43,005
-Stewart? Who are you?
-Passengers.

20
00:01:43,607 --> 00:01:48,476
I see. Having a fancy-dress party?
What happened?

21
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,762
-Dragons attacked us.
-Did they get the cargo?

22
00:01:50,847 --> 00:01:52,678
-I don't know.
-Yes, they took everything.

23
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:54,962
Including some rather valuable
property of mine.

24
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:57,925
-Well, tough luck.
-Oh, thank you very much.

25
00:01:58,447 --> 00:02:01,405
-Dragons... They attacked us.
-Yes, we know.

26
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:04,965
You say you're passengers. Isn't that
a little unusual on a cargo ship?

27
00:02:05,047 --> 00:02:06,685
Well, we're here, aren't we?

28
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:08,246
Where did you pick these two up?

29
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:09,760
I don't know.
I can't seem to remember...

30
00:02:09,847 --> 00:02:12,361
Pull yourself together!
How did they get on board?

31
00:02:12,447 --> 00:02:15,166
Stowaways...
That's it, they were stowaways.

32
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:17,556
-They were sending messages.
-That's right.

33
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:20,480
They were helping the Dragons.
They're traitors!

34
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:22,398
But that's absolute nonsense.

35
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:24,876
Look, we didn't want to be on this ship.
It was an accident.

36
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:26,639
You said you were passengers.

37
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:30,561
I was merely trying to avoid a lot of
tiresome explanations, old chap.

38
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:33,207
Stewart, I'll leave Kemp on board
to take your ship back to Earth.

39
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,322
What about these two?

40
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:35,681
Lock them in the hold,
put a guard on them.

41
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,321
-But we haven't done anything.
-They say you have. Take them away.

42

Now, if you'll only listen to me...

43
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:40,562
You can talk to Earth Security.

44
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:41,716
They'll listen, it's their business.

45
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:45,436
-Put them in the starboard cubicle.
-All right, get moving.

46
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:50,999
In there.

That's what he's there for, isn't it?

52

Right, we'll give it a few minutes,

53
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,757
then I'll start groaning
and pretending I'm ill,

-Then we'll take his gun,

56
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:52,079
go to the flight deck
and make somebody take us back to Earth.

57
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:55,557
Jo, this ship's already going back
to Earth.

58
00:03:55,647 --> 00:03:58,445
Oh. Oh, dear. Hmm.

59
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:02,999
Hey, I've got a terrific idea.

60
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:05,726
I saw this film once, you see,
and there were these two big gangsters,

61
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:07,286
big fellas they were,
with sort of cauliflower ears...

62
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:08,561
-Look, Jo!
-And one of them...

63
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:11,639
Will you stop pacing up and down
like a perishing panda.

64
00:04:11,727 --> 00:04:14,799
Now, come and sit down.
Let me think, will you?

65
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:17,000
That's better.

66
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,885
Doctor, well, now the Ogrons have gone,

67
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:24,527
why don't the crewmen remember
what really happened?

68
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:27,326
Because the true facts have been
erased from their minds, that's why.

69
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:29,602
Well, yes, but why did they keep telling
lies about us?

70
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,518
Oh, they don't know
that they're lying, Jo.

71
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:34,167
They're desperately trying to fit us
into their version of things.

72
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:36,477
Well, what are we going to do then?

73
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,080
Well, when we get back to Earth,

74
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:41,364
we've got to reach someone in authority
whose mind isn't already closed.

75
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,675
Closed to what?

76
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:44,200
Jo, look, these people believe

77
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:46,278
that the Draconians are attacking
their spaceships, right?

78
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:48,039
-Right.
-We know that they're wrong, don't we?

79
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:49,446
Well, yes, it was Ogrons.

80
00:04:49,527 --> 00:04:51,279
Oh, we also know that the Ogrons
couldn't possibly

81
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:53,198
have created that hallucinatory device

82
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:55,801
that makes the Earthmen think
they're Draconians.

83
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:58,526
Oh. Oh, well, that's simple then.

84
00:04:58,607 --> 00:05:02,202
I mean, what we've got to is
find out what's going on,

85

where they've taken the TARDIS,

-Right.

-Draconian agents? Are you sure?
-What else can they be?

110

But why? We...

112
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,078
Why would the Draconians
leave them on board the ship?

113
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:25,522
The Draconians are preparing for war.

114
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:27,996
You're still only suspecting that.
There is no proof.

115
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,839

But we are bound to suspect them.
They must have realised.

118
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:38,445
The Draconians probably thought
the crew was dead.

119

00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,679
(LAUGHING) What happened?

155
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,359
Well, the poor old machine
just couldn't believe it,

156
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:34,483
-had a nervous breakdown.
-And then what happened?

157
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,444
Well, they put me under
another one of these mind probe things

158
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:37,846
and the same thing happened.

159
00:08:37,927 --> 00:08:39,485
But you weren't telling the truth.

160
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:41,319
I mean, you weren't really going to
meet a giant rabbit,

161
00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:43,841
a pink elephant and a... What was it?

162
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:46,805
A purple horse with yellow spots.
Yes, I was.

163
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:50,038
You see, they were all delegates for the
third Intergalactic Peace Conference.

164
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:51,845
How did you get away from these things?

165
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:53,440
Well, they had to turn me loose
eventually.

166
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:55,722
-Why?
-They ran out of mind probes.

167
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,604
(BOTH LAUGHING)

168
00:08:57,687 --> 00:09:00,679
PRESIDENT: And you are quite
sure it was a Draconian battle cruiser.

169
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:01,802
Of course, Madam.

170
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:03,400
They locked on and boarded us.

171
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,001
We saw them. They were Draconians.

172
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:08,964
Thank you. That will be all.

173
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:12,039
I hope you will soon recover
from your ordeal.

174
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:19,086
Well, Your Highness?

175
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,203
These men are your servants.

176
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:24,120
They are saying what they
have been ordered to say.

177
00:09:24,207 --> 00:09:27,438
On this occasion, we have more
than our servants to confront you with.

178
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:29,165
We have captured
two of your human agents.

179
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:31,203
We have no human agents.

180
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:34,319
Subversion and espionage are
expressly forbidden

181
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,841
by the treaty of peace
between our two empires.

182
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:39,236
A treaty which you have
flagrantly broken.

183
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,124
I shall return to my embassy.

184
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:44,563
Just a moment please, Your Highness.
Bring them in.

185
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:52,206
These people stowed away
on the cargo ship.

186
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:53,481
They transmitted signals

187
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:56,240
which enabled your battle cruiser
to home in on its prey.

188
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:58,158
I know nothing of this.

189
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:02,445
Perhaps you do not, but some servant
of the Draconian empire employed them.

190
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:03,642
Madam,

191
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:06,685
I can assure that
I've never been employed by anybody.

192
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,678
Least of all by the Draconians.

193
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,680
Your servants should have been
better rehearsed in their lies.

194
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:15,964
Or they're showing a misguided loyalty
to their Draconian masters.

195
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:17,844
If we really were working
for the Draconians,

196
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:19,201
why did they leave us in your ship?

197
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:22,518
To act as spies when
you were brought back to Earth.

198
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:24,837
Allow me to congratulate you, sir.

199
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:27,839
You have the most totally closed mind
that I've ever encountered.

200
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,043
Madam, I beg of you to listen to me.

201
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:33,642
Some third party is trying to
provoke war between Earth and Draconia.

202
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:34,842
You are both being duped.

203
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,042
Take them away.

204
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,355
Just a minute, please.

205
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:38,721
Why should a third party wish
to do this?

206
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:39,876
I've no idea, Madam,

207
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,286
but believe me,
that is what is happening.

208
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:42,482
Take them away.

209
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:44,159
Now please listen to me!

210
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:48,877
If you don't you'll be involved in a war
that could cause the death of millions.

211
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:54,756
Is this the evidence
upon which you accuse me?

212
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:58,524
I must ask you to convey
a formal protest to your Emperor.

213
00:10:58,607 --> 00:11:03,886
I shall inform him of this latest insult
to the honour of the Draconian empire.

214
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:11,006
We should have used the mind probe
before we saw the ambassador.

215
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,396
If we'd had a full confession...

216
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:16,760
Has it occurred to you that they
might have been speaking the truth?

217
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:19,042
(SCOFFING) Is it likely?

218
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,557
Mysterious alien giants
that can change their form?

219
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:28,565
A pocket spaceship
that appears inside another?

220
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,445
I suppose you're right.
It is nonsensical.

221
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:33,366
Just you leave them to me.

222
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:36,359
I'll get the truth out of them,
eventually.

223
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,562
Well, we've seen the President.

224
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:45,605
I've got to get them to listen to me,
for their sakes as well as ours.

225
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:47,518
Well, why their sakes?

226
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:49,843
Well, that was a Draconian
with the President, you know?

227
00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:52,680
-Obviously an ambassador of some kind.
-So?

228
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:55,804
Well, clearly Earth and Draconia
are on the brink of war,

229
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,366
and they both believe
it's the other's fault.

230
00:12:57,447 --> 00:13:01,156
Well, never mind about that.
What about getting us out of here?

231
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,999
Well, I can but try.

232
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:11,442
Yeah, seems a fairly conventional
type of electronic lock,

233
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:14,326
rather old-fashioned really. Here goes.

234

(HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING)

235
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,077
(ALARM BLARING)

236
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:27,516
Yes, well, I think we'll sit here
for a while after all.

237
00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:44,755
But why?

238
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,757
Why should they produce
such an elaborate lie?

239
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:54,600
The ways of the Earthmen are devious.
They're an inscrutable species.

240
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:59,636
Obviously, they are preparing
the next stage of their plan.

241
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:04,797
First, the attacks on our ships
and now this.

242
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:10,163
Is it possible, Your Highness, that
for once the Earthmen spoke the truth?

243
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:14,525
Some plan of the Emperor of which
Your Highness has not been informed?

244
00:14:14,607 --> 00:14:18,043
The Emperor would not possibly
contemplate such a plan.

245
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:20,687
We do not break the treaty of peace.

246
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:28,278
Shall I prepare your Excellency's report
to the Emperor on this meeting?

247
00:14:28,807 --> 00:14:31,196
I must have more information.

248
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:38,004
It would be useful to question
the humans who were found on the ship.

249
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:42,836
They are supposed to be prisoners.

250
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:47,675
Prisoners have been known to escape,
Your Highness.

251
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:49,805
Not without help.

252
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:53,359
And that would be a grave act
of hostility.

253
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:56,805
I could not possibly countenance
such a plan.

254
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:02,522
But, should two escaping prisoners

255
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:06,797
seek sanctuary in this embassy,

256
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,359
it would be uncivilised
to turn them away.

257
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:18,755
I must not detain you longer.

258
00:15:19,247 --> 00:15:24,037

275

I shall have them brought here
immediately.

276
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:26,359
I suggest His Highness joins me here.
We shall question them together.

277
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,562
-On your feet.
-Hmm, why?

278
00:16:40,727 --> 00:16:42,445
You heard me. Move.

279
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:45,242
Not unless you give me some good reason.

280
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:48,239
The President wants you.
Is that good enough?

281
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:50,363
Perhaps she believed you?

282
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:55,002
Are you sure it's the President and
not another ridiculous interrogation?

283
00:16:55,087 --> 00:16:56,281
I said move!

284
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,598
Come on, Jo,
perhaps we can convince them after all.

But you don't understand!

It's the Draconians.
They've got the Doctor.

289

We must demand the immediate
withdrawal of the Draconian embassy.

Break off diplomatic relations
completely?

00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:43,483
What diplomatic relations?

292
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:45,923
The embassy staff have behaved
like criminals.

293
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:48,282
We don't know that the ambassador
was behind this.

294

The attackers were Draconians.
They were clearly seen.

295
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,800
The Draconian embassy tricked you
into moving the prisoners,

296
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:58,163
then mounted an armed attack
in order to rescue their agents.

break off diplomatic relations.

once this news gets out.

310
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:45,641
has left you in a very serious position?

311
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:47,479
But he didn't escape, he was kidnapped!

312
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:50,877
He was rescued
by your Draconian paymasters.

313
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:54,926
The wisest course you can take now
is to make a full confession.

314
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:58,239
Remember your colleague has left you
to your fate.

315
00:18:58,327 --> 00:18:59,840
But you've got it all wrong!

316
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:01,918
You see, the Doctor was pleased
when you sent for him

317
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,396
because he wanted to talk to you. And...

318
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:07,366
We have eye-witness reports
on what occurred.

319
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,439
We need to know how you came to work
for the Draconians.

320
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:12,483
When were you recruited?

321
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,681
How many agents do they have on Earth?

322
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:17,120
What are their plans?

323
00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:18,765
If you tell us everything,

324
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:23,045
I'll promise I'll see to it personally
that you will be treated leniently.

325
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:25,357
But I don't know what
you're talking about.

326
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:28,359
Look, we told you the truth when
we first came here.

327
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:30,324
We're not working for the Draconians.

328
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:31,635
We're wasting time.

329
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:34,878
I suggest you let me apply depth
interrogation techniques without delay.

330
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:38,004
Look, you can use your mind probe
or whatever.

331
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:40,763
I'm telling you the truth.

332
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:50,805
Well, I must say it's very nice of
you gentlemen to invite me here.

333
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:52,601
And where is Miss Grant?

334
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:55,360
Your companion is still with
your fellow Earthmen.

335
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:57,517
Don't you realise what you've done?

336
00:19:57,607 --> 00:20:00,644
You've now finally convinced them
that we're both Draconian agents.

337
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:03,400
There is no need to
maintain this pretence.

338
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:06,524
We know that you are both agents
of the Earth government.

339
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:09,280
You're part of a plot
against the Draconian empire.

340
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:10,800
My dear chap, I've already
been through all this

341
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:13,799
with the President of Earth.
She thinks I'm working for you.

342
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:17,675
-You are working for General Williams.
-I'm what?

343
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:19,644
General Williams hates our people.

344
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:23,163
Once before, he caused war
between us and the Earthmen.

345
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:25,078
Now he plans to do so again.

346
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:27,965
And such a war would be madness
since both empires will be destroyed.

347
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:29,116
Yes, I couldn't agree with you more.

348
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:31,243
That's exactly what I've been trying to
say to you.

349
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:34,080
The Earth cargo ship was not attacked
by Draconians.

350
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,158
It was not attacked at all.
The whole story is a lie!

351
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:39,523
I can assure you that it was attacked,
but by Ogrons.

352
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:41,086
-Ogrons?
-Yes.

353
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:42,960
Some third party's employing them

354
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:46,244
trying to make trouble
between Earth and Draconia.

355
00:20:47,007 --> 00:20:49,999
If you tell us the details
of General Williams' plan,

356
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:53,238
we shall be able to
expose him to your President.

357
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:55,921
There will still be a chance for peace.

358
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:59,920
My dear chap, nobody is more devoted
to the cause of peace than I am.

359
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:01,804
But I cannot tell you something
that I don't know.

360
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:04,196
We have mind-probing techniques

361
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:07,085
just as efficient as those
employed by you Earthmen.

362
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:10,079
If you do not speak now,
we shall force you to confess.

363
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:12,681
Don't you realise you're
completely on the wrong tack?

364
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,485
There is a plot, yes.

365
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:18,196
But the Earthmen are not behind it,
any more than you are.

366
00:21:18,447 --> 00:21:19,926
Take him away!

367
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:25,722
No!

368
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:35,366
Stop him!

369
00:21:36,007 --> 00:21:37,156
Halt!

370

371
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:03,996
Hello, Jo.

372
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:05,725
Doctor, where've you been?

373
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:09,641
I've been paying a brief but unwilling
visit to the Draconian embassy.

374
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:11,046
And I'm afraid I had to
leave in rather a hurry

375
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:12,321
and found myself back here.

376
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:13,681
What happened?

377
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:15,200
Well, believe it or believe it not, Jo,

378
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:18,040
they think we're working for General
Williams and trying to provoke a war.

379
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:19,276
Oh, no!

380
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:22,200
Yes, Earth is blaming Draconia
and Draconia is blaming Earth.

381
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:24,482
-And both sides are blaming us.
-That's about it.

What's the matter?

384
00:22:27,407 --> 00:22:30,843
Well, that sound, the one
I heard on the cargo ship.

385
00:22:31,927 --> 00:22:34,077
I think I can hear it again.
