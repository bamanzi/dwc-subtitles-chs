为什么这些船员还是想不起来真正发生了什么?

73
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:27,326
Because the true facts have been erased from their minds, that's why.
因为真相已经从他们大脑里面抹掉了, 这就是为什么

74
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:29,602

哦, 这样, 但为什么他们又一直说胡说八道呢?

哦, 他们并不知道他们在胡说八道, Jo

They're desperately trying to fit us into their version of things.
他们只是在尽力地把我们装进他们那个版本的真实中去

Well, when we get back to Earth,
现在, 等我们回到地球

we've got to reach someone in authority
whose mind isn't already closed.
我们应该能碰到某个当权者, 他的大脑没有那么封闭?

封闭?

81
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:44,200
Jo, look, these people believe

that the Draconians are attacking their spaceships, right?
是龙族人袭击了他们的飞船, 对吧?

- 是的   - 我们知道他们说的是错的, 是不?

Well, yes, it was Ogrons.
嗯, 是的, 是 Ogrons 干的

have created that hallucinatory device
能制造出那种致幻设备

87
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:55,801
that makes the Earthmen think they're Draconians.
可以让地球人产生错觉, 以为是龙族人袭击了他们

88
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:58,526
Oh. Oh, well, that's simple then.
哦, 哦, 这样就简单了

89
00:04:58,607 --> 00:05:02,202
I mean, what we've got to is find out what's going on,
我是说, 我们要做的, 就是搞明白到底是怎么一回事

who's behind the Ogrons, where they've taken the TARDIS,
谁在操纵这些 Ogrons, 他们又把 TARDIS 带到哪里去了

00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:08,247
go and get it back and then we can all go home.
我们去把它找回来, 然后我们就可以回家了

92
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:09,840
- Right? - Right.
- 对吧?  - 对

the minute that ship touches down.
我需要飞船一着地, 就在周边拉起警戒线

104
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:46,402
Now, if you'll excuse me.
现在, 我先退下了

105
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:51,397
What did they think they're doing?
他们以为他们在干什么?

106
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,762
We've been landed for simply ages.

00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:05,846
- Outside. - We want to see somebody in authority.

You're going to, but outside.
你会见到的, 不过得先出来

113
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:14,038
Now then, what's all this about?
既然这样, 这些又什么意思

114
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:17,718
- Draconian agents? Are you sure? - What else can they be?
- 龙族特工? 你确定吗?   - 要不然还能是什么

115
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:19,240
Their story is obvious nonsense.
他们的故事显然说不通啊

116
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:21,079
But why? We...
为什么? 我们...

117
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,078
Why would the Draconians leave them on board the ship?
为什么龙族人会把他们继续留在飞船上?

118
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:25,522
The Draconians are preparing for war.
那些龙族人正在准备一场战争

You're still only suspecting that. There is no proof.
你这只是在怀疑, 但没有证据

120
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,839
Then they need to plant human agents,
所以他们需要安插两名人类特工

121
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:32,805
traitors, on this planet to sabotage our war effort.
两个叛徒, 好让他们在这个星球上破坏我们的反击

但我们肯定会怀疑他们啊, 他们肯定能想到这个

123
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:38,445
The Draconians probably thought the crew was dead.
那些龙族人也许认为船员都死了

124

Your Highness has not been informed?
