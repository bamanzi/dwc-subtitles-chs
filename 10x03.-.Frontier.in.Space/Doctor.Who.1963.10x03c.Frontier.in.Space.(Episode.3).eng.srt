you do as you're told.

If you behave yourselves,
you'll be reasonably treated,

That's probably the last time
you'll see the Governor.

I sympathise with your position.

266
00:13:58,967 --> 00:14:02,198
But my government has sought
these criminals throughout the galaxy.

267

They are now prisoners
of the government of Earth.

With the greatest respect,
General Williams, I must disagree.

270
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:11,005
They are citizens of Sirius 4.

271
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:12,679
Part of Earth's empire.

272
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:16,043
Yes, but it has been granted
dominion status.

273
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:18,561
He has a point, General Williams.

274
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:20,922
Once a colony has been raised
to dominion status,

275
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:23,316
it enjoys certain autonomous rights,

276
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:26,479
including the right to try
and punish its own citizens.

277
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:29,559
Exactly. But I feel sure that
once these two have come to trial,

278
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:30,875
my government will be only too happy

279
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:33,481
to send them back to you
for further interrogation.

280
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:36,161
But, meanwhile, my orders are clear.

281
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:38,477
I must take them back
with me to Sirius 4.

282
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:43,038
I will not hand over vital prisoners
to some tin-pot colony!

283
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:46,477
As the commissioner has
pointed out, General Williams,

284
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:50,276
Sirius 4 is no longer a colony.
It is a dominion.

Your request is granted.

286

You may rest assured, General Williams,

Anytime. There's no day or night here.

No. Uh, tell me, Professor, when...

For all I know,
you could be a spy for the Governor.

307

If I were, I'd hardly be
drawing attention to myself

00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:53,640
quite so quickly, now would I?

No, a valid point of logic.

I wonder if I can trust you?

You've little
or no alternative, Professor.

We're all in this sector together.

00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:10,115
Oh, I was sent here at the express wish
of a certain General Williams.

317
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:11,276
We have no proof of that.

318
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,835
We have no reason to tell you anything.

319
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:15,883
I'll tell you something.

320
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:18,959
There is a conspiracy to start a war
between Earth and Draconia.

321
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:21,242
There are warmongers on both sides.
We are aware of that.

322
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:24,285
But there's also
a third party, Professor,

323
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:27,803
who's plotting to set the two empires
at each other's throats.

324
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:35,356
No, I'll see her alone.

325
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:49,201
Penny for them, Miss Grant?

326
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:52,677
You! What are you doing here?

327
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,120
To coin a phrase,

328
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:56,437
I've come to take you
away from all this.

329
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:58,643
-What are you talking about?
-Well, surely you don't want to spend

330
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,046
the rest of your life in here, do you?

331
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:01,799
Well, I'm not going anywhere with you,
that's for sure.

332
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,639
Oh, but you are, you know.

333
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:04,796
Believe it or not,

334
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:08,766
I am a fully accredited commissioner
from the planet Sirius 4

335
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:11,122
and you and the Doctor
are two dangerous criminals

336
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:13,801
being handed over into my custody.

337
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,559
So it was you!

338
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:17,842
You ordered those Ogrons
to attack the ships

339
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:19,155
and pretend they were Draconians!

340
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,362
But, of course!

341
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:22,165
Those lumbering idiots
could never have thought up

342
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:24,522
such a brilliant scheme by themselves.

343
00:17:24,607 --> 00:17:27,679
Why did you want to start a war?

344
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,367
Now, come on, Miss Grant, be reasonable.

345
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:32,278
You want to see
the Doctor again, don't you?

346
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:34,835
-Where is he?
-He's in another prison, on the Moon.

347
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,918
We're going to collect him.

348
00:17:37,007 --> 00:17:38,838
How do I know you're telling the truth?

349
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:40,076
You don't.

350
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:42,965
And the only way you'll find out
is by coming with me.

351
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:44,162
Well?

352
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:45,475
(SIGHING)

353
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,727
How did you know
we were here in the first place?

354
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:52,479
Well, after they'd attacked
the cargo ships,

355
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:57,083
the Ogrons returned to their planet,
taking their loot with them.

356
00:17:57,167 --> 00:18:00,159
Now imagine my surprise, and my delight,

357
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,205
when I found that
they brought me the Doctor's TARDIS.

358
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:04,959
And why are you taking us with you?

359
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:06,400
Oh, need you ask?

360
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:09,524
How could I leave two dear friends
in such dire straits?

361
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:11,040
Oh, you don't seriously think that

362
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:12,321
I'm going to believe that
you want to help us...

363
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:14,523
Believe what you like, Miss Grant,
I have my reasons.

364
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:16,006
Now, are you coming,

365
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:19,762
or do you really wish to vegetate in
this hole for the rest of your natural?

366
00:18:21,127 --> 00:18:23,357
Very well. I'll come.

367
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:24,846
Excellent!

368
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:30,318
The prisoner and I
are ready to leave now, guard.

369
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:32,957
Anywhere is better than here.

370
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:40,202
DOCTOR: Well, there you are.
There you have it.

371
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:41,925
That's how I came to be here.

372
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:43,679
It's fantastic!

373
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:45,678
I mean, our people seeing Draconians,

374
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:49,646
Draconians seeing Earthmen.
I can't believe it.

375
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,797
Well, I can.

376
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:53,320
Good grief.

377
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:56,237
Do you know, sir, you're
the first person who's believed me?

378
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:58,283
It would explain a great deal.

379
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:01,242
After the stupidity of
the Draconian war,

380
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:06,276
the bitterness eventually died down
and we had many years of peace.

381
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:07,961
There were trade treaties,

382
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,561
cultural exchanges and then,

383
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:13,684
for no reason at all,
these sudden acts of hostility.

384
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:14,916
(DOOR OPENING)

385
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:17,157
Dale! Over here!

386
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:20,080
-Yes, what is it?
-Spot check. You ought to know.

387
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:24,126
If you'll excuse me,
one of our little prison rituals.

388
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:32,241
This is it. There's a VIP landing
on this spaceship

389
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:33,521
in 10 minutes' time, Bay 7.

390
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,757
You can pinch it.
I've set up two spacesuits for you.

391
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:37,075
I can't believe it.

392
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:38,885
Well, I keep my promises,
now you keep yours.

393
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:40,844
When you get back to Earth,
don't forget who your friends are.

394
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,316
When the Peace Party takes over,
you will be given a free pardon,

395
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:45,238
you have my word.

396
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:47,557
Right, you're clean. Report to
Air lock 3 for maintenance work.

397
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:50,923
You and one other.
You can choose him yourselves, okay.

398
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:52,884
-DOCTOR: What is it? What's up?
-Oh,just a search.

399
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:54,844
All part of the routine.

400
00:19:58,247 --> 00:19:59,646
(DOOR CLOSING)

401
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:03,163
Come on, Professor. Come on!

402
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:06,559
You were giving off conspiracy
in waves over there.

403
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:09,278
You can trust me, you know.

404
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:12,837
The escape plan, it's now.

405
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:17,365
We have to walk from the air lock,
across the Moon's surface.

406
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,084
We're going to steal a spaceship.
They've left two spacesuits for us.

407
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:23,397
Who are you taking with you?

408
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:24,840
Well, I had planned
to take another member

409
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:27,441
of the Peace Party committee

410
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:31,042
but I'm afraid he'll have to
give up his place.

411
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:33,439
Doctor, I want you to come with me.

412
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:34,721
Well, that's very generous
of you, but...

413
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:37,321
We must get you back to Earth
so that you can tell your story.

414
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:38,999
Well, it was telling my story on Earth

415
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:40,361
that got me sent here
in the first place.

416
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,438
We have contacts everywhere,

417
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:45,963
journalists, broadcasters,
even friends in the government.

418
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:47,685
We'll make them believe you.

419
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:51,358
Thank you, Professor.

420
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,438
You don't know what it means to me
to have found allies at last.

421
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:54,960
Well, we'd better be going, Doctor.

422
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,925
This spaceship
will be landing any moment.

423
00:21:07,127 --> 00:21:09,641
Good! He's left it open.

424
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:16,481
Excellent! Excellent!

425
00:21:23,447 --> 00:21:26,041
Come on, Doctor, we haven't got long.

426
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:29,999
Take this one?

427
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:36,758
We can't use the main entrance
to the spaceport.

428
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:39,122
It's too well guarded.

429
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:41,641
All we have to do is to walk
across the Moon's surface,

430
00:21:41,727 --> 00:21:44,480
about 10 minutes and we're there.

431
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:48,242
Tell me, Professor,
why is Cross helping you?

432
00:21:48,327 --> 00:21:51,319
A kind of bribery, I'm afraid.

433
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:55,204
I promised to get him a free pardon
once we get into power.

434
00:21:55,287 --> 00:21:57,755
That's extraordinary. I would have
thought he would have wanted something

435
00:21:57,847 --> 00:21:59,405
far more positive than promises.

436
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:01,284
DALE: Oh, he's not a bad fellow
when you get to know him.

437
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:03,244
I appealed to his better self.

438
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:05,522
Now do hurry, Doctor.

439
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:14,556
(ZIPPER FASTENING)

(AIR HISSING)

441
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:17,479
What's that?
I thought I heard something.

442
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:19,444
Yes. Now, Doctor,

443
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:22,963
clip my cylinder on the back of my suit
and then I'll fix up yours.

444
00:22:23,047 --> 00:22:24,560
DOCTOR: All right.

445
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:28,958
-Well, this one's empty.
-It can't be.

446
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,436
Well, it certainly is.
Take a look for yourself.

447
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:33,722
There, look at the gauge.

448
00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:37,961
Yes, and so is this one.

449
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:40,763
They're both empty, Professor.

they're pumping out the air!
