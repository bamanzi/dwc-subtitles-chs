That's very generous of you, madam,

You leave me no alternative.

但我的政府在搜索这些罪犯, 把整个星系搜了个便

267
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:04,801
They are now prisoners of the government of Earth.
他们现在是地球政府的囚犯

268
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:05,922
That's good enough.
差不多就这样吧fixme

269
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:09,204
With the greatest respect, General Williams, I must disagree.
带着极大的敬意, Williams 将军, 我必须不同意

270
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:11,005
They are citizens of Sirius 4.
他们是天狼星4号的臣民

271
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:12,679
Part of Earth's empire.
那也是地球帝国的一部分

272
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:16,043
Yes, but it has been granted dominion status.
是的, 但它已经被授权可以自治

273
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:18,561
He has a point, General Williams.
他说得有点道理, Williams 将军

274
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:20,922
Once a colony has been raised to dominion status,
一旦殖民地被授予自治权

275
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:23,316
it enjoys certain autonomous rights,
它就应该享有这份权利

276
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:26,479
including the right to try and punish its own citizens.
这也包括审判和惩罚它自己臣民的权利

277
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:29,559
Exactly. But I feel sure that once these two have come to trial,
正是. 但我很肯定, 一旦这两个人被审判了之后

278
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:31,875
my government will be only too happy to send them back to you
我们政府会很乐意将他们送回来

279
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:33,481
for further interrogation.
以便你们进一步审讯

280
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:36,161
But, meanwhile, my orders are clear.
但与此同时, 我收到的命令也是很清楚的,

281
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:38,477
I must take them back with me to Sirius 4.
我必须把他们带回天狼星4号

282
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:43,038
I will not hand over vital prisoners to some tin-pot colony!
我不会把这么重要的囚犯交给某个破烂殖民地

283
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:46,477
As the commissioner has pointed out, General Williams,
正如专员所指出的, Williams 将军,

284
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:50,276
Sirius 4 is no longer a colony. It is a dominion.
天狼星4号已经不是一个殖民地了, 它是一个主权国

285
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:52,998
Your request is granted.
你的请求被批准了

286
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:56,238
Madam President, I am most grateful.
总统夫人, 我由衷感激

287
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:59,285
Heaven help you if you let them escape!
如果你让他们逃跑的话, 让老天帮你吧

288
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,801
You may rest assured, General Williams,
你可以回去休息了, Williams 将军

289
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,923
they will be perfectly safe with me.
他们跟我在一起非常安全

290
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:09,325
Right, keep it moving!
好了, 往前走

291
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:11,798
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

292
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:14,916
Is this all we get?
我们就只能得到这个?

293
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:17,965
It contains all the elements to support life.
这东西包含了能支撑生命的所有要素

294
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:21,203
Mmm, and absolutely nothing to make it enjoyable, eh?
唔, 但完全没考虑把它做得讨喜一点, 是吧

295
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,562
You get used to it after a month or two.
你过一两个月就习惯了

296
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,080
Anyway, it's all we ever get.
不管怎么说, 我们只能得到这个

297
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:27,920
- Keep moving! - You heard him, move!
- 继续往前走!  - 你听到了, 走!

298
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:30,715
Not exactly friendly, are they?
他们一点也不友好, 是吧

299
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:32,843
One gets used to it.
早就习惯了

300
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:34,201
What time do we get to bed?
我们什么时候上床呢?

301
00:15:34,287 --> 00:15:37,563
Anytime. There's no day or night here.

302
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:40,957
No. Uh, tell me, Professor, when...
不, 嗷. 告诉我, 教授, 什么时候...

303
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:42,560
When do you plan to escape?
你打算什么时候逃跑?

304
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:44,638
No one escapes from here.
没人能从这里逃跑

305
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:46,479
But you're going to try?
但你还是要试?

306
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:49,286
For all I know, you could be a spy for the Governor.
就我所知的情况, 你可能是监狱长派来的奸细

307
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:52,040
If I were, I'd hardly be drawing attention to myself
如果我是, 我会这么着急地显露自己吗

308
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:53,640
quite so quickly, now would I?
会吗?

309
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:57,117
No, a valid point of logic.
不会. 有点道理

310
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,323
I wonder if I can trust you?
我在想, 能不能信任你

311
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:01,716
You've little or no alternative, Professor.
你的选择很少, 或者说没有, 教授

312
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:02,876
We're all in this sector together.
我们都在这个片区

313
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:04,195
Whatever you do, I shall know about it.

314
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:06,357
Yes, but we don't know you.

315
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:07,562
Why did they send you here?
他们为什么把你送进来?

316
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:10,115
Oh, I was sent here at the express wish of a certain General Williams.
哦, 某个 Williams 将军一声令下, 我就被送到这里来了

317
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:11,276
We have no proof of that.
我们没有见到证据

318
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,835
We have no reason to tell you anything.

I'll tell you something.
我跟你说

320

There is a conspiracy to start a war between Earth and Draconia.
现在有一场阴谋, 要挑起地球与龙族之间的战争

321
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:21,242
There are warmongers on both sides. We are aware of that.
两边都有一些好战分子, 这我们很清楚

322
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:24,285
But there's also a third party, Professor,
但还有一个第三方, 教授

323
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:27,803
who's plotting to set the two empires at each other's throats.
他的阴谋已经让两个帝国相互掐住了咽喉

No, I'll see her alone.
不, 我要单独见她

325

Penny for them, Miss Grant?

You! What are you doing here?
你! 你在这里干什么?

327
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:56,420
To coin a phrase, I've come to take you away from all this.
简单地说, 我来带你远离这一切

329
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:57,643
What are you talking about?
你这是什么意思

Well, surely you don't want to spend the rest of your life in here, do you?
你当然不会期望在这里过完你的下半辈子, 是吧?

331
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:01,799
Well, I'm not going anywhere with you, that's for sure.
这是当然. 但我也不打算同你去任何地方

Believe it or not,

But, of course!

Now, come on, Miss Grant, be reasonable.

You want to see the Doctor again, don't you?
你还想再见到博士的, 对吧?

- 他在哪儿?  - 他现在在另外一个监狱, 月球上

You don't.

How did you know we were here in the first place?

Now, are you coming,
现在, 你是跟着走呢?

That's how I came to be here.

Good grief.
感谢老天

Do you know, sir, you're the first person who's believed me?
你知道吗, 先生, 你是第一个相信我的

378
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:58,283
It would explain a great deal.

- 怎样, 有什么事?  - 哦, 只是搜查一下

Come on, Professor. Come on!

You were giving off conspiracy in waves over there.

403

You can trust me, you know.

The escape plan, it's now.

我们必须先走到减压舱去, 从月球表面过去

啊, 那你真是太慷慨了, 不过...

We must get you back to Earth so that you can tell your story.
我们必须把你弄回地球, 这样你就可以把你的故事讲出去

that got me sent here in the first place.

Thank you, Professor.

你不知道, 终于找到盟友对我来说意味着什么

Well, we'd better be going, Doctor.

Take this one?

We can't use the main entrance to the spaceport.

428
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:39,122
It's too well guarded.
那里守卫严密

429

All we have to do is to walk across the Moon's surface,
我们要做的, 就是从月球表面穿过去

Tell me, Professor, why is Cross helping you?

A kind of bribery, I'm afraid.
这算是一种行贿, 恐怕是

I promised to get him a free pardon once we get into power.
我承诺他说, 一旦我们掌权了, 会给他一个赦免

00:21:55,287 --> 00:21:57,755
That's extraordinary. I would have thought he would have wanted something
这很特别啊. 我原以为他想要的东西很难给呢

435
00:21:57,847 --> 00:21:59,405
far more positive than promises.
没想到一个承诺就搞定了

436

DALE: Oh, he's not a bad fellow when you get to know him.
哦, 他倒不是个坏人, 如果你了解他的话

00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:03,244
I appealed to his better self.

Yes. Now, Doctor,

clip my cylinder on the back of my suit and then I'll fix up yours.
在我后背挂一下氧气瓶, 然后我来挂你的

444

There, look at the gauge.

Yes, and so is this one.

They're both empty, Professor.

The door, it's locked!

你不明白吗, 朋友, 他们正在往外排空气!
