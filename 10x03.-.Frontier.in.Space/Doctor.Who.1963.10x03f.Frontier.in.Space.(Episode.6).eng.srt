to try a little harder, Miss Grant.

Congratulations, my dear.
I seem to have failed again.

Yes, you do, don't you?
Never mind! You can't win 'em all!

19
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:48,796
Hmm! I shall have to think about this.

20
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:53,165
I'm afraid I shall have to ask you
to be my guest for a little longer.

-Yes, what is it?

-Two raiding ships have returned.
-Oh, were they successful?

25
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:12,680
They found and attacked
two Earth cargo ships.

-Where was this?
-In Earth space.

Your Royal Highness,
could you convince your people

39
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:03,999
they were not being attacked
by Earthmen?

40

(SIGHING) If only we had proof.

We shall use my personal scoutship.

00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:25,366
a course correction to galactic
coordinates 2349-6784.

51
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:26,880
You realise where that will take us?

52
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,037
A completely uninhabited sector
of the galaxy.

53
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:31,118
Well, not completely uninhabited,
General Williams.

54
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:32,560
That's where the Ogron's planet is.

55
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,842
No doubt your information
is better than mine.

56
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:37,999
-May I ask where you obtained it?
-Certainly. From the Master.

57
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:41,159
He fed the co-ordinates into his
ship's computer when I was his prisoner.

58
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,885
And after you'd captured the ship, sir,

59
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:45,003
I extracted the information
from the ship's memory banks.

60
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:47,237
We're simply wasting time...

Let me talk to them, I shall explain!

63

Somehow I don't think
they're in the mood

64
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:54,842
for explanations at this minute.

65
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,485
-Can you outrun them?
-This ship can outrun anything.

-Right, we're out of range now.
-Reduce speed, return to course.

I regret the behaviour of my people.

-Yes?

I can't get her back on course, sir.

One of the drive outlets
is malfunctioning.

There's damage
to exterior electrical circuit.

75
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:26,396
-Can't you repair it?
-It'll mean going outside, sir.

76
00:05:26,487 --> 00:05:27,715
Put the ship on automatic
and get out there.

77
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:29,923
No good, sir.
I've got to control it manually.

78

Right, well, you hold her steady.
I'll go and effect the repairs.

-Stand by for hyper-drive.
-We can't, sir.

91
00:06:57,847 --> 00:07:00,236
The Doctor's had to disconnect
the main circuitry to make the repair.

92
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:03,000
I can't reach the speed
until he's finished.

93
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:05,681
If my people fire, he will be killed!
Let me speak to them!

94
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:07,246
Do you think they'll wait to talk?

00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,318
The Draconians are coming up fast,
Doctor.

96
00:07:09,407 --> 00:07:11,443
If you don't get that repair finished,
we'll be a sitting target.

that close, sir,

What about that repair?
Will it stand the heat?

107

Well, we'll just have to risk it.
We can't see anything from up here.

Mayday, mayday.

109

This is an urgent message
for both Draconian and Earth forces.

We're nearly over the horizon.

-Did you get a fix on it?
-Pretty close.

117
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:21,240
I can put us down on a general area.

118
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:22,760
How long will it take us
to complete the orbit?

-About 20 minutes.
-Increase speed.

Please inform the authorities
of either Earth or Draconia.

That was the trap.

Oh, no. You're the one who's trapped.

your entire position away!

Yes. I left those galactic
coordinates for you to find.

-You mean they were fakes?
-Oh, no, no, no.

They're genuine enough.

On the contrary, the Doctor heard you.

Yes, at this moment, he's orbiting
the planet in a small spaceship.

a little while ago.

My dear Miss Grant,
who else could it be?

137

You see, when the Doctor arrives,
we'll be waiting for him.

138

-Oh, yes, a most ingenious device.

304
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:52,596
I congratulate you.

305
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:54,245
OGRONS: Oh! The monster!

306
00:22:54,327 --> 00:22:55,521
(HYPNOTIC PULSE SOUNDING)

307
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:07,120
-Oh, Doctor, I thought you were dead.
-Help me.

308
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:11,200
Come on, yes. Careful.

309
00:23:17,087 --> 00:23:18,805
-Help me into the TARDIS, Jo.
-Okay.

310
00:23:21,727 --> 00:23:23,683
-All right, Jo.
-Careful.

311
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:33,123
The first thing we've got to do
is get out of here.

312
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,080
(WHOOSHING)

313
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:41,726
(BEEPING)

314
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:44,439
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

315
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:47,166
Doctor, what are you doing?

316
00:23:47,247 --> 00:23:52,002
Telepathic circuits,
sending a message to the Time Lords.
