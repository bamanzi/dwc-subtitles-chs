2
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:35,778
In that case,
I shall have to try something else.

00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:39,896
You may have heard this
noise before, Miss Grant.

(HYPNOTIC PULSE THROBBING)

00:00:41,787 --> 00:00:46,702
It works directly on the fear centres
deep in your mind!

6
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:53,459
It's not real! It's an illusion!

7
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:56,425
MASTER: Then we shall have
to try a little harder, Miss Grant.

8
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:58,179
JO: It's not real!

9
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,339
It's you! It's the Master!

10
00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:05,624
MASTER: You cannot shut your eyes!
It is impossible!

11
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:07,345
Let's try a little harder!

12
00:01:07,427 --> 00:01:13,059
JO: It's... It's not real!
It's an illusion! It's you!

13
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:17,459
It's the Master!
It doesn't work on me any more!

14
00:01:18,107 --> 00:01:19,381
It's you!

15
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:24,624
It doesn't work on me any more!

16
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:29,098
It doesn't work on me any more! It...

17
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:39,342
Congratulations, my dear.
I seem to have failed again.

18
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:44,458
Yes, you do, don't you?
Never mind! You can't win 'em all!

19
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:48,096
Hmm! I shall have to think about this.

20
00:01:48,187 --> 00:01:52,465
I'm afraid I shall have to ask you
to be my guest for a little longer.

21
00:01:53,387 --> 00:01:56,026
Show Miss Grant to her room, will you?

22
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:58,739
JO: No, let me go!

23
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:05,939
-Master?
-Yes, what is it?

24
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:09,224
-Two raiding ships have returned.
-Oh, were they successful?

25
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:11,980
They found and attacked
two Earth cargo ships.

26
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:14,023
-Where was this?
-In Earth space.

27
00:02:14,107 --> 00:02:16,905
One ship resisted. We destroyed it.

28
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:21,185
(LAUGHING) Excellent!
That should stir things up.

29
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:25,180
It can't be long now before
they declare war on each other.

<i>War! War! War!</i>

36
00:02:52,747 --> 00:02:54,817
I don't know how much longer
I can hold them.

37
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:58,217
You must tell them, it is not the
Draconians that attack you.

38
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:01,458
Your Royal Highness,
could you convince your people

39
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:03,299
they were not being attacked
by Earthmen?

40
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:05,947
(SIGHING) If only we had proof.

41
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:09,064
Then I could convince my people
and you could convince yours.

42
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,138
But there's not much time.

43
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:14,856
Madam President, everything is ready.
We shall use my personal scoutship.

44
00:03:14,947 --> 00:03:17,780
We'd better leave at once.
Madam President.

45
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:23,976
-My life at your command.
-Madam President.

46
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:27,425
Thanks, cheerful.

00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:19,301
DOCTOR: Right, 34 seconds,

50
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:24,666
a course correction to galactic
coordinates 2349-6784.

51
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:26,180
You realise where that will take us?

52
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,337
A completely uninhabited sector
of the galaxy.

53
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:30,418
Well, not completely uninhabited,
General Williams.

54
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:31,860
That's where the Ogron's planet is.

55
00:04:31,947 --> 00:04:34,142
No doubt your information
is better than mine.

56
00:04:34,227 --> 00:04:37,299
-May I ask where you obtained it?
-Certainly. From the Master.

57
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:40,459
He fed the co-ordinates into his
ship's computer when I was his prisoner.

58
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,185
And after you'd captured the ship, sir,

59
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:44,303
I extracted the information
from the ship's memory banks.

60
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:46,537
We're simply wasting time...

61
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:49,026
Dragons!

62
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:51,575
Let me talk to them, I shall explain!

63
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,020
Somehow I don't think
they're in the mood

64
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:54,142
for explanations at this minute.

65
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,785
-Can you outrun them?
-This ship can outrun anything.

66
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:58,745
Hyper-drive. Max hyper-drive!

67
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:06,826
-Right, we're out of range now.
-Reduce speed, return to course.

68
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,016
I regret the behaviour of my people.
The officer will be punished.

69
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:13,541
Well, we were infringing Draconian space
after all, Your Royal Highness.

70
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:14,980
-General Williams...
-Yes?

71
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:16,546
I can't get her back on course, sir.

72
00:05:16,627 --> 00:05:19,425
One of the drive outlets
is malfunctioning.

73
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,415
Do you know exactly what's wrong?

74
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:23,304
There's damage
to exterior electrical circuit.

75
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:25,696
-Can't you repair it?
-It'll mean going outside, sir.

76
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:27,015
Put the ship on automatic
and get out there.

77
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:29,223
No good, sir.
I've got to control it manually.

78
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:32,265
Right, well, you hold her steady.
I'll go and effect the repairs.

79
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:34,781
No doubt you're a qualified
space engineer, too, Doctor?

80
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,186
Naturally.

81
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,940
How's it going, Doctor?

82
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:31,336
DOCTOR OVER RADIO:

are catching up with us.

00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:40,221
PILOT: Once they're in range,
they'll fire again.

87
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:41,376
Doctor, there's a ship approaching.

88
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,345
<i>We think it's the Draconians.</i>
<i>How long will you be?</i>

89
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:45,496
<i>I've no idea, old chap.</i>

90
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:57,057
-Stand by for hyper-drive.
-We can't, sir.

91
00:06:57,147 --> 00:06:59,536
The Doctor's had to disconnect
the main circuitry to make the repair.

92
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,300
I can't reach the speed
until he's finished.

93
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:04,981
If my people fire, he will be killed!
Let me speak to them!

94
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,546
Do you think they'll wait to talk?

95
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,618
The Draconians are coming up fast,
Doctor.

96
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:10,743
If you don't get that repair finished,
we'll be a sitting target.

97
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:13,775
DOCTOR: <i>I know. I'm on the outside.</i>

98
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:20,104
WILLIAMS: <i>It's getting very close.</i>
DOCTOR: <i>I'm being as quick as I can.</i>

99
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:27,223
-He's done it!
-DOCTOR: <i>Right, I'm coming in now.</i>

100
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:28,422
WILLIAMS: Right, stand by.

101
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,419
Maximum hyper-drive!

(GASPING)

103
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:08,338
Pilot, can you get her
into a closer orbit?

104
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:09,746
If you want me to take her in
that close, sir,

105
00:09:09,827 --> 00:09:11,499
we may have to enter the atmosphere.

106
00:09:11,587 --> 00:09:13,862
What about that repair?
Will it stand the heat?

107
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:16,336
Well, we'll just have to risk it.
We can't see anything from up here.

108
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,025
Mayday, mayday.

109
00:09:57,107 --> 00:10:01,419
This is an urgent message
for both Draconian and Earth forces.

110
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:03,623
The Ogrons are using a planet,

111
00:10:03,707 --> 00:10:07,825
galactic coordinates 2349-6784,

112
00:10:08,547 --> 00:10:12,335
as a base for their attacks
on both Earth and Draconian spaceships.

113
00:10:12,427 --> 00:10:14,258
-We're losing the signal.
-JO: <i>Please inform the authorities.</i>

114
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,496
-Can you boost it up?
-JO: <i>I repeat...</i>

115
00:10:15,587 --> 00:10:17,418
I'm sorry, sir.
We're nearly over the horizon.

116
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:18,940
-Did you get a fix on it?
-Pretty close.

117
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:20,540
I can put us down on a general area.

118
00:10:20,627 --> 00:10:22,060
How long will it take us
to complete the orbit?

119
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:23,626
-About 20 minutes.
-Increase speed.

120
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:27,463
Please inform the authorities
of either Earth or Draconia.

121
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:30,186
I repeat, mayday, mayday, this is a...

122
00:10:31,707 --> 00:10:34,744
Thank you, Miss Grant.
That was the trap.

123
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:37,341
Oh, no. You're the one who's trapped.

124
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:39,702
I've just given
your entire position away!

125
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:43,257
Yes. I left those galactic
coordinates for you to find.

126
00:10:44,147 --> 00:10:45,978
-You mean they were fakes?
-Oh, no, no, no.

127
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,420
They're genuine enough.

128
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:49,896
But this is a short-range transmitter.

129
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:51,420
So no one will have picked up
your message

130
00:10:51,507 --> 00:10:54,738
more than two or three hundred miles
from this planet.

131
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:55,896
Nobody heard me.

132
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:59,138
On the contrary, the Doctor heard you.

133
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:03,618
Yes, at this moment, he's orbiting
the planet in a small spaceship.

134
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:05,937
I picked him up on radar
a little while ago.

135
00:11:06,027 --> 00:11:07,221
How do you know it was the Doctor?

136
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:10,026
My dear Miss Grant,
who else could it be?

137
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:13,258
You see, when the Doctor arrives,
we'll be waiting for him.

138
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:15,258
So you have been useful to me after all.

00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:25,898
There. Now he'll think that this homing
signal comes from you, Miss Grant.

143
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:29,423
By the way, congratulations.

144
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:32,021
I knew I could count on you
to get out of your cage.

145
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:33,540
Right, take her away.

146
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:36,699
And, this time, make sure
that she's properly under guard.

147
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:40,097
JO: No, no, no!

148
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:47,581
-How much longer?
-Two seconds to go.

00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:50,103
WILLIAMS: We're overheating badly.

150
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:52,382
Yes, I know. This is it.
We should pick her up again now.

(SIGNAL BEEPING)

152
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,899
What is that signal?

153
00:11:57,507 --> 00:11:59,384
Jo must have fixed up
some kind of homing device.

154
00:11:59,467 --> 00:12:02,220
Splendid! That'll lead us right to them.

155
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:04,623
Doesn't it strike you
as being a bit too convenient?

156
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:05,776
Hmm.

157
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:17,226
-The drive outlet circuit's gone again.
-Can you get her down?

158
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:19,867
Yes. But I'm not sure where.

159

they should be here very soon now.

(DEVICE BEEPING)

161
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:27,586
Judging by the size of the ship,
they can't be in any great force.

162
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:32,821
So conceal yourselves and ambush them
as soon as they arrive, right?

163
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:34,704
Hold on, wait a minute.
Something's happened.

164
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,698
They must have landed very nearby.

165
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:37,936
Right, send out patrols!

166
00:12:38,027 --> 00:12:39,619
Get them and bring them

to frighten the Ogrons away

237

and then we can all escape.

238

Well, that's hardly practical,
Miss Grant.

239
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:39,266

and we'd still be locked in.
