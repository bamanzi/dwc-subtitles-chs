We're approaching a planet.
我们正在向一个星球靠拢

What's the matter my dear?
怎么回事, 亲爱的？

11
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,536
I burnt myself on the console.
我被控制台烫了一下

12
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:10,461
Oh, something overheating here. 
Just as well we're landing?

00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,361
Susan, check the fault locator please.
苏珊, 请检查一下故障定位器

Yes Grandfather.
好的爷爷

We're not going to blow
up or anything, are we?
我们不会爆炸什么的吧, 会吗？

16
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:16,231
Oh no no no, of course not.
噢, 不不不, 当然不会

17
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:20,273
It's just, well, there we were 
in the late eighteenth century
只是, 这个, 之前我们在18世纪晚期的时候

18
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:24,873
and I tried another frequency to sidestep the ship
back into the middle of the twentieth century.
我尝试了另一个频率, 将船绕回到20世纪中期

00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:28,588
GRANDFATHER, THE DOORS, THEY'RE OPENING!
爷爷, 门, 自己开了！

What's happening... Unbelievable!
怎么回事...难以置信！

21
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,129
Chesterton close the doors please! We haven't materialised properly! Quickly!
切斯特顿请把门关上！我们还没有正确完成实体化！快点！

22
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:38,831
- What do you mean close the doors?
- Don't argue dear boy
- 什么意思, “关上门”？  - 别跟我争论, 孩子

23
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:41,067
it's an emergency, close the doors!
Quick! Use force!
情况危急, 去关上门！快！用力啊！

24
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,114
Is everything alright?
一切都还好吗？

25
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:04,857
We're just landing.
我们刚刚着陆了

00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,544
Susan, go back to the fault locator, 
苏珊, 回去看看故障定位器

32
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:25,144
and I want you to check everything, 
child you understand, EVERYTHING!
而且我要你检查每样东西, 孩子你明白吗, 每样东西！

33
00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:27,213
Well at least we seem to be alright.
还好, 至少我们似乎都没事

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,849
Mm? Oh don't be childish, they opened!
嗯？哦别这么幼稚了, 门打开过了！

35
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:34,983
The doors opened before
we had properly materialised!
门打开了, 在我们还没完全实体化之前！

36
00:02:35,286 --> 00:02:36,688
But what does it mean?
但那又意味着什么？

37
00:02:36,754 --> 00:02:37,589
Hah-ah!
啊哈！

38
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:40,525
Doctor, you needn't keep it a secret from us!
博士, 你没有必要对我们保密!

39
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:41,292
What?
什么？

40
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:43,227
Doctor, don't keep us in suspense.
博士, 别让我们心里打鼓

41
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:45,365
Oh don't go on with these futile questions, please!
噢, 不要继续问这些无用的问题, 拜托！

42
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,265
Can't you understand, can't you see?!
你不明白吗, 你看不到吗？!

43
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:49,033
No we can't - that's just it!
不, 我们不能 - 就这个！

44
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,205
Oh we were just about to materialise 
when the doors opened 
唉, 我们正要实体化, 这时候门打开了

45
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:53,605
and we hadn't properly adjusted!
我们还没有做出相应调整！

46
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:55,673
You mean something went out of the ship?
你是说有什么东西跑出去了？

47
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,975
No that's impossible!
不, 那是不可能的！

48
00:02:56,975 --> 00:02:58,309
Came inside then?
那就是跑进来了？

49
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:01,114
Oh please, don't keep talking
on the twentieth-century level!
噢, 拜托, 不要再在20世纪的水平上说话

50
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:02,814
I'm talking about time-travel!
我在说的是时间旅行！

51
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:07,151
Neither of you can understand what
I'm talking about, I can s-see that!
你们没一个人能懂我在说什么, 我算是明白了！

52
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,754
How could we, you've
never explained it to us!
我们怎么能懂, 你都从来没有跟我们解释过！

53
00:03:09,787 --> 00:03:11,655
- My dear boy...
- Grandfather everything's alright! 
- 小伙子...  - 爷爷, 一切都很正常！

54
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:14,392
There isn't a fault anywhere,
not even on yellow standby!
任何地方都没有故障, 即使是黄色备用系统也没有!

55
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,632
But there must be something wrong, Susan! 
但肯定有什么地方出错了, 苏珊！

56
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,921
I shall have to check that fault locator 
myself to make sure, excuse me...
我还是得自己去检查故障定位器, 保险起见, 失陪...

57
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,369
Oh I do wish he wouldn't talk in riddles!
哦, 我真希望他不要说谜语！

58
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:29,374
So do I. Susan perhaps you can help us?
我也是. 苏珊, 也许你可以帮我们一下？

59
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:34,012
I just know that the most dangerous
moment is at the point of materialisation.
我只是知道最危险的时候就是实体化这个时刻了

60
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,154
Nothing's ever happened to us before.
以前我们什么都没发生过

61
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:38,116
Well the doors have never
opened like that before.
这门以前也从来没有这样打开过

62
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:44,258
Well, happily no harm's been done. It's most puzzling.
好吧, 很高兴没有造成任何伤害. 这事非常令人费解

63
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:46,618
Oh my dear Barbara was I rude to you just now? 
哦, 亲爱的芭芭拉, 刚才我太凶了吧？

64
00:03:46,711 --> 00:03:50,996
If so, I'm so sorry. I always
forget the niceties under pressure. 
如果是, 我很抱歉. 一有压力我总是忘记风度

65
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,531
- Please forgive me.
- There's nothing to forgive.
- 请原谅我 - 没什么关系

66
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,533
Thank you. Hm.. Hah!
谢谢你. 嗯...哈！

67
00:03:57,102 --> 00:04:00,041
Well I suppose everything's alright. And yet, er... 
好吧, 我估计一切都正常. 还有...

68
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:03,841
See the temperature there is perfectly...
it's quite safe to go outside.
看外面的温度很合适...去外面相当安全

69
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:07,979
Oh Susan, just turn on the scanner a
minute, let's try and see where we are.
苏珊, 把监视器打开一下, 我们看看我们在哪儿

70
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,684
<i>Doctor!</i>
博士！

71
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:14,686
Perhaps you need a new tube Doctor?
也许你需要一个新的显像管(:-), 博士

72
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:16,220
Did you notice the way it blew out?
你注意到爆炸的方式了吗？

73
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:19,223
It was like an internal explosion.
感觉像是一个内爆

74
00:04:19,223 --> 00:04:21,659
Yes, like, like ehh...something
too big for it's frame!
感觉像是...什么东西太大了撑破了

75
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:22,594
Yes.
是的

76
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,362
And yet, I don't know...
That can't be right!
但是, 我不知道...那不可能！

77
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:27,933
What do we do now Doctor? Take
the scanner out and strip it down?
我们现在怎么办博士？把监视器拿出来, 把它剥掉？

78
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:31,572
Oh no no no, dear boy. No. 
It's most puzzling of course, 
噢, 不不不, 乖孩子, 不要. 这事当然很让人不解

79
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:33,970
but now we don't know what's behind those doors.
但现在我们不知道门后面有什么

80
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:36,808
Well we must go outside and look.
You said it was quite safe...
那我们必须出去看一看, 你说过外面很安全...

81
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:40,611
Yes...I wonder why the..? Well, we must see.
是的...很奇怪为什么...好吧, 我们必须看看

82
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:42,612
- Shall I open the doors Grandfather?
- Er, yes please Susan.
- 那我打开门了, 爷爷  - 呃, 好, 打开吧苏珊

83
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:45,214
But all of you, cautiously please!
但你们所有人, 都务必小心！

84
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:56,259
Doctor, what made the doors open before?
博士, 之前是什么把门打开了？

85
00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:00,763
The space pressure was far too great 
whilst we were materialising.
我们在实体化的时候, 太空压力过于巨大了

86
00:05:02,398 --> 00:05:04,872
The strange thing is that 
we all came out of it unscathed!
奇怪的是, 我们都毫发无损地过来了!

87
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:09,372
Hah, it's, it's most puzzling, 
it's a big mystery my boy, come along...
哈, 这是最令人费解的, 这是一个很大的谜, 孩子, 快来..

88
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:11,874
It's like a mountain pass or something.
这里像是一个山口什么的

89
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:21,784
Now why wouldn't the scanner
show us all this mm?
为什么监视器不告诉我们这些？

90
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:24,656
Perhaps that was the only damage to the ship, Doctor. 
也许, 那是对船的唯一破坏, 博士

91
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:26,656
Overloading on the scanner circuits.
让监视器线路过载了

92
00:05:28,057 --> 00:05:30,293
Yes, I suppose so, it could be...
是, 我想是, 有可能..

93
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:33,763
What a strange rock formation!
多么奇怪的岩层啊!

94
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:35,698
Yes, it is, isn't it?
是, 的确, 是吧？

95
00:05:35,698 --> 00:05:38,201
There are two different types of rock. Doctor?
这里有两种类型的石头, 博士？

96
00:05:38,234 --> 00:05:39,135
Mm?
嗯？

97
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:41,300
Look... This is ordinary stone up here, 
看...上面这里是普通的石头

98
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:44,300
but this down here seems to be quite different.
但下面这种就有很大不同

99
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:54,417
Chesterton, here. Come here,
look here. Is that cement? Heh.
切斯特顿, 过来, 到这里来. 看这个, 这是水泥吧

100
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:57,186
Might be.
可能是

101
00:05:57,186 --> 00:05:59,122
Rather a rough kind isn't it?
很硬的那种, 对不？

102
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:04,861
Mn, very rough. They look like
pebbles of sand don't they?
嗯, 非常硬. 它们看起来像鹅卵石, 不是吗？

103
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:08,567
Yes, yes as a matter of fact
it's in a way to hold the stone in place. 
是的, 事实上, 这在某种程度上是为了把石头固定好

104
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:10,467
You know, to fix it firmly beneath!
知道吧, 把它牢牢固定在底下

105
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,769
I would have thought the stone was
heavy enough to keep itself in place.
我还以为这块石头足够重, 可以保持自己的位置

106
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:14,437
Yes, it's all most odd
isn't it? Most odd...
是的, 这一切很奇怪, 是吧？最奇怪的是...

107
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:17,463
Now Barbara, I suggest that you and I take that path, 
芭芭拉, 我建议你和我挑这条路

108
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:20,343
and Susan and you sir, er, go that way, mm?
而苏珊和先生你, 走那条路, 嗯？

109
00:06:21,778 --> 00:06:23,849
Yes alright, but stay within calling distance,
行吧, 但保持在通话距离内

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,240
and you see anything sing out. We'll do the same.
你们看到什么东西就喊出来. 我们也会这样

111
00:06:26,316 --> 00:06:28,385
Yes, yes, yes... Mmm.
好, 好, 好...嗯

112
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:29,886
Mm...
唔

113
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,189
Now take this rock here,
it's most extraordinary...
现在拿这个石头来说, 它就非常不寻常...

114
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:37,794
Doctor! Doctor, it's a huge snake!
博士, 博士, 这有条巨蛇！

115
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:39,129
What, eh?
什么？

116
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:40,964
Let's call the others.
我们把其他人叫来

117
00:06:40,997 --> 00:06:46,102
Oh, er, wait wait wait...
Yes, I-I I think it's dead.
哦, 等等, 等等. 是了, 我想这是死的

118
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,067
Ian! Look at this.
伊恩！看这个

119
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,807
That's odd. I suppose it couldn't
be an egg, hah. Not that size.
这很稀奇. 我想它不会是个蛋, 哈！没有那么大的

120
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:58,777
There are more of them over there, look.
那边还有更多, 看

121
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,646
Yeah. Ostrich?
是啊, 鸵鸟的？

122
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:04,149
It would have been rounder than this.
那应该会比这圆些

123
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:11,623
There are dozens of them over here! 
There's a whole pile of them!
这里有好多！有一整堆呢！

124
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:17,896
Oh! Ian, Ian!
啊！伊恩, 伊恩！

125
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:24,903
It is dead isn't it?
这是死的吧？

126
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:34,282
Yes. It's dead alright - stiff as a poker. 
是了, 它是死的, 没事 - 僵硬得跟扑克一样

127
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:37,582
What a fantastic size!
这么大的个头！

128
00:07:37,616 --> 00:07:39,551
Yes.
是

129
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:42,587
It's a giant ant.
这是只巨蚁

130
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,460
It is like it isn't he? It looks as
if it was trying to carry these eggs.
它就像...看起来它好像是想搬运这些卵

131
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:50,864
Yes, well that's natural behaviour for an ant,
是的, 这对蚂蚁来说是自然的反应

132
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:52,276
when it's attacked, take the eggs to safety.
当它受到攻击时, 就把卵带到安全的地方去

133
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,368
The worker ant would give his life
rather than abandon the eggs you know...
工蚁会献出自己的生命, 而不是放弃蚁卵, 你知道吗...

134
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:58,737
Well he couldn't have had
much of a chance could he?
他不可能有太多机会, 对吧？

135
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:01,106
I mean he must have died quickly.
我是说他一定很快就死了

136
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:05,246
Yeah... All these eggs scattered about.
是的...所有这些蚁卵都散落一地

137
00:08:05,563 --> 00:08:08,246
Other ants must have been frightened away.
其他蚂蚁一定被吓跑了

138
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:17,856
I wonder what sort of a world
could produce an insect that size?
我想知道什么样的世界能产生这么大的昆虫？

139
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:21,929
Well here we are then, this is the tail end of it, and I know what it is.
好, 我们到这里了, 这是它的尾部, 而且我知道这是什么了

140
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,520
- It's a huge earthworm.
- What?
- 这是一只巨型蚯蚓  - 什么？

141
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:26,782
Yes, there are no earthworms
this size on your planet.
是的, 在你们的星球上没有这么大的蚯蚓

142
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:28,250
You're right there aren't!
你说得对, 没有

143
00:08:28,284 --> 00:08:33,089
know except for it's size, I would
swear that it came from your world.
要知道不考虑它的大小的话, 我得发誓它来自你们的世界

144
00:08:33,122 --> 00:08:36,459
However, lets..er, let's go on. Come along.
但是, 我们..呃, 我们继续. 一起来吧

145
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:41,665
Now this is really baffling!
现在这真的很令人费解！

146
00:08:49,607 --> 00:08:52,643
A huge picture of Night Scented Stock!
一幅紫罗兰的巨大图片!

147
00:08:52,676 --> 00:08:56,388
Yes it is, but why put up a picture of it? I don't get it.
的确是, 但为什么竖一幅它的图片？我搞不懂

148
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,708
Ah, some writing there... "Alf's Seed Company, Norwich!"
啊, 这里有些文字：“Alf 种子公司, 诺威奇”

149
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:05,589
Norwich! That's England isn't it? Norfolk!
诺威奇！那属于英格兰的对不？诺福克郡的！

150
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:10,294
Yes, it is. Susan, this
means we're on Earth!
是啊, 真的, 苏珊. 这就意味着我们在地球上

151
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:17,001
Something's very odd here,
first those ants, now this.
这里有些东西非常奇怪, 先是那些蚂蚁, 现在是这个

152
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,492
Hey, look at the end
of that, it's all charred!
嘿, 看这末端, 全都碳化了!

153
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,229
Yes, you can see quite clearly
what this is. It's a matchstick.
是的, 你可以很清楚地看到这是什么东西. 它是一根火柴

154
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,496
Well it certainly looks like one.
嗯, 看起来应该是

155
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,799
No, it just doesn't look
like one, it is a matchstick.
不, 不只是看起来是, 它就是一根火柴

156
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:27,967
What, that size?!
什么, 那么大？

157
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,438
Don't you see, that huge earthworm and now this? 
你没明白吗, 那个巨型蚯蚓, 现在又这个？

158
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:32,735
Can't you see what's happened Mm?
你没明白是怎么回事, 嗯？

159
00:09:43,623 --> 00:09:45,591
Look at this matchbox!
看这个火柴盒！

160
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:03,512
It must be an exhibition Susan, something like the world fair. 
这一定是一个展览, 苏珊, 有点像世界博览会

161
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:07,547
- Things this size...
- No Ian.
- 都是这么大的东西  - 不是, 伊恩

162
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:11,084
Well what else? look
at the scale of things!
那还能是什么？看看这些东西的规模！

163
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:13,152
You're wrong Ian, completely wrong!
你错了, 伊恩, 完全错了!

164
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:19,625
I-I thought just now that something was
wrong when I saw that, but now I'm sure.
我刚才看到那个时, 以为是什么东西出了问题, 但现在我确定了

165
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,128
Alright, what's your theory then?
好吧, 那你的结论是什么？

166
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:26,532
That these things haven't been made
bigger, we've been made smaller!
那就是, 这些东西没有变大, 而是我们变小了!

167
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:27,767
Smaller?!
变小了？

168
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,836
We have been reduced roughly
to the size of an inch!
我们已经被缩小到大约一英寸的尺度!

169
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,572
An inch?!
一英寸？！

170
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:36,309
Mm. You, me, all of us, and the ship!
嗯. 你, 我, 我们所有人, 还有飞船!

171
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:52,992
We must get hold of the others
quickly and return to the TARDIS!
我们必须迅速找到其他人, 返回到 TARDIS!

172
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,748
- What's that?
- What is it?
- 什么声音？  - 是什么？

173
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:00,718
Run Susan, run!
跑, 苏珊, 快跑！

174
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:02,353
- Look out!
- Urgh!
- 小心！ - 啊！

175
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:22,957
Yeah.. Well it looks a
tremendous distance to me.
好了...唔, 在我看来这有好长一段距离

176
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:28,798
There's a house over there, and there's
a man sitting down reading something. 
远处有一栋房子, 还有一个人坐在那里阅读什么东西

177
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:31,600
It's a notebook I think.
是个笔记本, 我想

178
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,334
- Did he have the matchbox?
- How do I know?!
- 是他拿了火柴盒吗？  - 我怎么知道？

179
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:37,104
I don't know how you know,
but you surprise me sometimes.
我不知道你怎么能知道, 但你时不时会给我们些意外

180
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:38,971
Yes, I suppose so. Look, watch
what you're doing will you?!
嗯, 估计是. 嘿, 小心一点行不？

181
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:42,876
Look, Doctor give us some hope, I
mean, Ian's inside that matchbox!
博士, 给我们点希望吧, 我是说, 伊恩在那个火柴盒里面！

182
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:44,608
Gently, gently gently!
轻点, 轻点轻点！

183
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:46,279
We've got to find Chesterton!
我们得找到切斯特顿！

184
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:48,315
But Grandfather, supposing the
man walks off with the matchbox!
但是爷爷, 假设那个人拿着火柴盒走了呢？

185
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:51,655
Have courage my dear! I know that 
all of this is a bit of a nightmare,
有点勇气, 亲爱的! 我知道这一切都有点像是噩梦

186
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:55,255
but we've just got to get Ian back 
and then we can go back to the ship.
但我们得把伊恩找回来, 然后我们就可以回船上去了

187
00:11:55,288 --> 00:11:57,090
And then can you get
us back to normal size?
然后你能让我们恢复正常的大小吗？

188
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:59,665
But of course, yes I'll try!
There's always a chance!
当然了, 我会试试, 总应该有可能的！

189
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,565
But first things first, we must find Chesterton
但事有先后, 我们必须先找到切斯特顿

190
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:06,868
It's Mr Forester isn't it?
We spoke on the telephone...
是弗瑞思特先生是吗？我们在电话里说过话...

191
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:10,739
Yes, I got here as quickly as I could.
I hope you haven't taken any action yet?
是的, 我尽快地赶过来了. 我期望你还没有采取什么行动吧？

192
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,008
Not yet, but I have written my report.
还没有, 但我已经写好报告了

193
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,047
You do realise what's at stake here Mr Farrow? 
你知道这样会有什么后果吧, 法柔先生？

194
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,047
The early experiments were noted
by the ministry, welcomed in fact!
早期实验结果已经在部里备案了, 事实上反响不错啊！

195
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:23,985
I've already geared factories, advertising
and all the rest of it to start pushing DN6.
我已经联系好了工厂、广告商这些, 要开始推DN6了

196
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:27,889
I'm sorry about that, but I can't
give you the approval that you want.
对此我很抱歉, 但我不能给出你想要的批准书

197
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:30,250
I see.
我明白了

198
00:12:32,523 --> 00:12:37,561
You're aware of course that if it doesn't
go into production I shall be completely ruined?
你当然也知道, 如果它不投产, 我就会彻底破产？

199
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:42,566
That is very unfortunate, but really, you
should have waited till we gave you the go-ahead!
那真的很不幸, 但真的, 你应该等我们点了头再开始的！

200
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,904
Well that's all very well, 
but it doesn't help me does it?
话倒是没错, 但这对我已经没帮助了是吧

201
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:47,604
Surely we can work something out?
也许我们可以想点什么办法？

202
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,441
There's a fortune to be made out of this...
可以借此赚上一笔...

203
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,211
I don't think I want to go
on with this conversation.
我觉得我不想再继续这场谈话了

204
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:58,880
Do you know why I am a success Mr Farrow?
你知道我为什么是一个成功者吗, 法柔先生？

205
00:12:59,123 --> 00:13:01,980
Because I've never allowed
the word "can't" to exist
因为我从来不允许“不能”这个词存在

206
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,680
There's always a way, always!
总是有办法的, 总是！

207
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,148
Not this time.
这次没有

208
00:13:06,148 --> 00:13:10,892
This isn't business, this is science,
the formulae is unacceptable
这不是生意, 这是科学, 这个配方是不可接受的！

209
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:16,492
And I can't and I do mean can't Mr Forester,
allow DN6 to go into production!
我不能, 说了就是不能, 弗瑞斯特先生, 允许让DN6投产!

210
00:13:21,864 --> 00:13:23,899
Now I'll make that phone call.
现在我要去给部里打电话了

211
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:25,367
Just a moment!
等一下！

212
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:32,590
I think It's dead.
我觉得它死了

213
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:33,858
But it could still sting!
但它还是可能蜇人！

214
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,428
Mm. Hah-ha! What an awe-inspiring sight!
唔, 哈哈！多么令人敬畏的景象！

215
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:41,468
Now what chance would 
human-beings have, I really wonder,
人类还有什么机会, 我很好奇

216
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:44,068
in a world of creatures like this bee, mm?
这世界的生物要都像这蜜蜂这样的话, 嗯？

217
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:45,269
None at all!
一点机会没有！

218
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,138
Little closer look...
稍微近一点看...

219
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,646
Well I haven't taken my eyes off it 
Grandfather, it hasn't even trembled.
我没把眼挪开过, 爷爷, 它连抖一下都没有

220
00:13:53,852 --> 00:13:55,346
It seems you're right, it is dead.
看来你是对的, 它是死的

221
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:57,948
The same distinctive aroma!
同样的一种香精味

222
00:13:57,948 --> 00:14:00,017
Yes, I've noticed it on
all the other dead things.
是的, 我在其它的死亡生物上面也注意到了

223
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,619
Well that must be what's killing them then.
那可能就是那个东西杀死了它们！

224
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:03,721
I wonder what would want to
kill off nature like this?
我很好奇什么东西想要杀死这些自然生物呢？

225
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:06,223
Well what worries me is 
all the different things it's killing.
让我担心的是, 它可以杀死这么多不同的生物

226
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:08,596
Things that fly in the air,
things that move on the ground...
天上飞的, 地上走的...

227
00:14:08,654 --> 00:14:12,096
things that move under the ground.
So indiscriminate.
地底爬的, 全不放过

228
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:13,764
- Doctor?
- Mm?
- 博士？  - 嗯?

229
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:18,002
Whatever it is that's killing these
things... Could it kill us too?
不管是什么东西杀死了这些东西...它也能杀死我们吗？

230
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:20,709
Well, we must presume that it can.
是啊, 我们必须认定它能

231
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:25,609
So no eating or drinking until we've
done our very best to find Ian mm?
所以不要吃喝东西, 我们竭尽所能找到伊恩, 嗯？

232
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:28,245
<b>(A roaring boom momentarily
splits through the heady silence.)</b>

233
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:15,188
He's been shot dead.
他被枪杀了

234
00:15:15,188 --> 00:15:16,856
- Are you sure he is dead?
- Oh yes
- 你肯定他已经死了  - 哦, 是的

235
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,493
Nothing but death all around us!
我们周围没有别的, 全是死亡！

236
00:15:20,227 --> 00:15:21,895
Yes, what's happening here?
是, 到底发生了什么？

237
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,433
You weren't with us Chesterton, but
every insect we came across was dead.
你刚才没跟我们在一起, 切斯特顿, 但我们路过的每个昆虫都死了

238
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,320
Yes, Susan and I saw a
great many huge dead ants.
是啊, 苏珊和我看到了好多死去的巨型蚂蚁

239
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,939
Everything else was the same, Ian.
其它的所有东西也是一样, 伊恩

240
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,345
Yes, and we don't know 
what it is that killed them.
是, 而且我们不知道是什么东西杀死了它们

241
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:38,245
But that man, he's been shot. Murdered!
但那个人, 他是被枪杀的, 谋杀！

242
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,349
But who'd kill insects in
a perfectly ordinary garden?
但谁会杀死一座普通花园里面所有的昆虫呢？

243
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:43,954
I mean pests one can understand, but...
我觉得要是害虫还可理解, 但是...

244
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:47,545
Surely it's wrong to kill bees
and worms and things isn't it?
杀死蜜蜂、蚯蚓这些显然是不对的, 是吧？

245
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:50,490
Quite so. Both are vital
to the growth of things.
的确是, 它们对于植物生长都很重要

246
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:53,865
However, we must leave this little
mystery and get back to the ship.
不管怎样, 我们必须撇下这个不解之谜, 返回到飞船去

247
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:58,665
As I said my dear, it's fortunate
for all of us that everything is dead...
如我所说, 亲爱的, 所有东西都死了也算我们幸运...

248
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:01,501
Argh! Grandfather!
啊！爷爷！

249
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,139
Don't move, any of you.
别动, 任何人

250
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:11,398
And whatever you do,
don't look into the cat's eyes.
而且不管你们怎么做, 不要看猫的眼睛

251
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:13,158
Close your own if you want to.
想闭眼睛的话就闭上

252
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:17,771
Doctor, I think the cat's losing interest.
博士, 我觉得这猫失去兴趣了

253
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:21,995
Don't relax! One swipe of it's paw
would smash us to pieces!
别放松！猫爪挥一下就能把我们撕成碎片！

254
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:33,558
Well we can't get back to the ship just
yet, and you know how fast cats can move.
看来我们暂时还不能回飞船, 你知道猫能跑多快的

255
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:36,597
And another thing, we could be mistaken for mice
还有一个问题是, 我们可能会被错当成老鼠

256
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:39,297
and I don't fancy being part of the cat's diet!
我可不喜欢变成猫的美餐！

257
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,390
Oh it gets more horrifying every moment!
噢, 一刻比一刻变得恐怖了！

258
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:43,483
Look, couldn't we make contact
with the people here somehow?
对了, 我们不能跟这里的人取得某种联系吗？

259
00:16:43,518 --> 00:16:43,805
No, I'm afraid not.
不, 我觉得不能

260
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,845
Well why not, they might be able to help us.
为什么不, 他们也许能帮上我们

261
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,405
It's out of the question my dear, 
how could we possibly communicate with them?
这是不可能的, 亲爱的, 我们怎么能与他们交流呢？

262
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,417
Imagine a record played 
at the wrong speed, Susan.
想想一张唱片，以错误速度播放着, 苏珊

263
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,217
We'd sound like a little squeak to them, 
and they'd sound like a low growl to us.
对他们来说我们的声音就是悉悉索索, 他们对我们就是低吼

264
00:16:55,252 --> 00:16:58,111
Anyway, even if we could communicate, 
what would they do to us?
而且, 就算我们能交流, 他们又能帮我们做什么？

265
00:16:58,146 --> 00:17:00,018
We're freaks. They'd put us in a glass case
我们是怪人, 他们会把我们放到玻璃瓶子里面

266
00:17:00,146 --> 00:17:02,018
and examine us through a microscope!
用显微镜来观察我们！

267
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,548
Oh that's a thought isn't it.
哦, 那只是个猜测, 对不？

268
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,596
And I would add another
and more important factor.
我还可以补充一个更加重要的因素

269
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:11,978
The people that live in this house
are murderers, or one of them is.
住在这个房子里面的人是杀人犯, 至少有一个是

270
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:14,929
Therefore, we can't expect
sympathy and understanding
所以, 我们不能指望获得同情与理解

271
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:18,429
from an insane or a criminal mind!
从一个疯子或者罪犯那里！

272
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:20,992
Yes, what about that dead man?
对. 这个死人怎么办？

273
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:22,421
Oughtn't we to do something about it?
我们是不是应该做点什么？

274
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:26,301
Well what can we do my dear? I
mean, surely this is the question.
我们能做什么呢, 亲爱的？我是说, 这的确是一个问题

275
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:30,855
Normally I wouldn't hesitate, but the 
destruction of the life-force is frightful,
通常来说我不会犹豫, 毕竟生命的逝去是很可怕的

276
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:32,987
but there it is! I mean, what can we do as we are?
但已然发生了(?). 我是说, 我们这样子能做什么呢？

277
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:39,037
Well, I can't see any sign of that cat, 
however much safety that gives us.
好了, 我没见到那只猫的影子了, 也许这能让我们觉得安全点

278
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:40,236
Well, shall we proceed?
那, 我们继续？

279
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:43,875
I can see a huge leg coming, run!
我看见一条巨腿走过来了, 快跑！

280
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,942
This...this way!
这...这边！

281
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:47,523
- No, Barbara
- Go on, Susan!
- 不, 芭芭拉  - 走啊, 苏珊！

282
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:48,723
- I'd like to help you, Ian.
- Go on!
- 我想帮你们一下, 伊恩  - 走！

283

- Sorry!
- It's alright. This way, quickly!
- 抱歉！  - 没事, 这边, 快！

284
00:17:51,312 --> 00:17:53,256
Oh, Grandfather, they're overstepping on us!
哦, 爷爷, 它们要踩到我们了！

285
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:55,722
Oh they're alright, they're alright. It's
a pity they didn't come this way though.
没事了, 没事了. 很遗憾他们俩没有朝这边过来

286
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:56,631
Well shall we go over to them?
那, 我们去他们那边吧？

287
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:59,565
No, no, it's dangerous!
Let's go over to that pipe there!
不, 不, 太危险了！我们到那条管子那里去！

288
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:20,591
Come on Barbara, get out of
here before it moves again.
快点芭芭拉, 赶紧出来, 否则一会儿又移动了

289
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:23,291
- Oh...that was worse than the big dipper.
- It was. 
- 噢...这比过山车还难受  - 的确

290
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,845
You know we were lucky this case was full.
要知道我们还是幸运的, 这个包比较满

291
00:18:29,393 --> 00:18:33,739
Course, it had to happen to us, 
of all the places to pick, hah,
是啊, 那么多地方可以去, 偏偏让我们赶上了, 哈

292
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:35,435
we had to choose one that was movable!
我们还非得选一个会移动的！

293
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:37,139
Have you any idea where we are?
你清楚我们在什么地方吗？

294
00:18:37,174 --> 00:18:40,623
That's a ceiling up there.
那上面有个天花板

295
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:45,578
That means we're indoors and 
the Doctor and Susan are outside.
这意味着我们在户内, 而博士和苏珊在外面

296
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:46,903
Let's move the body.
我们来搬尸体吧

297
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:53,192
Where can we put him?
我们能把他放哪儿？

00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:55,702
In a store room.
放储藏室去

299
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:24,420
They've gone
他们走了

300
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:30,562
It's much better when they're
a long way away, isn't it?
还是让他们走远一点更好, 对吧？

301
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:34,015
Are you sure you saw one of
them pick up the briefcase
你确定你看见他们中的一个拿起了公文包？

302
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:35,210
and go into that building behind us?
走进了我们后面那栋房子？

303
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,442
Well I definitely saw him pick up the briefcase.
我绝对看见他拿起了公文包

304
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:41,189
Well when he walked past us it was
just like a mountain, just a blur, you know.
嗯, 当他走过我们时, 就像一座山, 很模糊, 你知道吗

305
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:43,949
But he must have gone inside the house!
但他一定是走进了那栋房子!

306
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:47,453
Careful Grandfather, well
don't fall down there will you?
小心点爷爷, 别掉下去了, 好吗？

307
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:54,330
Oh-hah-Ooh POO! FAWF! An awful
smell of chemical in there!
噢-哈-噢-噗, 里面一股难闻的化学品味道！

Oh yes.
哦, 真是

309
00:19:55,965 --> 00:19:57,418
Foof! Oh, hm.
呼！噢, 嗯

310
00:19:57,553 --> 00:19:59,385
It's not just an ordinary drainpipe is it?
这不是一根普通的排水管, 对吧？

311
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,091
Now, I wonder if that pipe extends into 
the room where that briefcase went.
现在, 我在想那根管子是不是也通到房子里, 就是公文包所去的房子 

312
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:05,727
Are you thinking of climbing up the inside of it?
你在考虑从里面爬上去？

313

Yes, yes of course my dear,
there's no other way.
是的, 当然是, 亲爱的, 没有其它的办法

314
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:12,610
If you go in there you'll see it's all corroded
so there's plenty of hand and foot holds.
如果你进去就可以看到全都腐蚀了, 所有有很多地方可以搭手脚

315
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,966
And that chemical smell means that it's germ free.
而且那种化学品味道就意味着里面没有细菌

316
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:18,614
Oh, but it's too far for you grandfather!
哦, 但对你来说这太远了, 爷爷！

317
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:22,530
Well If it is, then I shall have to give up,
and I'm not going to give up before I've tried.
如果是, 那我就不得不放弃, 但我不打算还没尝试就放弃

318
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:24,404
And remember you must think of the other two,
记住你得替另外两个人考虑

319
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:28,634

themselves 
they're only one inch high!

00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:31,602
There's only the two of us to help them!
这里只有我们两个可以帮助他们！

321

- 好吧, 但你得让我走前面  - 好, 好, 走...

322
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:43,451

00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:45,069
Mm, yeah.

00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:48,598
What do you suppose it is, corn, wheat?
你觉得这是什么, 玉米, 麦子？

325
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:49,840
Wheat.
麦子

326
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:56,350
Still haven't thought of a way
of getting out of this place...
还是没有想到一个办法走出这个地方...

327
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:58,423
Oh yes, you're right it is wheat.
哦是的, 你说对了, 这是麦子

328
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:03,471
Ooh, it's all covered in some
sticky stuff, like toffee.
喔, 外面都包了一层粘稠的东西, 像是太妃糖

Hey Barbara, look at this...
嘿芭芭拉, 看这个...

330

Give me your handkerchief will you?
把你的手绢给我, 好吗？

00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:13,281
Do you see what this is?
A book of litmus papers, hah!
你明白这是什么吗？一叠石蕊试纸, 哈！

332
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:18,628
How often have I held a piece of
litmus paper in my fingers..? 
我经常将一叠石蕊试纸捏在手指间

333
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:22,594

334
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:26,235
You realise what this place is?
你明白这是什么地方吗？

335
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,156
Ooh it's some sort of a laboratory.
哦, 这是一间实验室

336
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:32,903
Yes, I think it must explain
those dead insects and things.

They must be doing some experiments.

338
00:21:35,731 --> 00:21:37,921
Course it makes it all
the more dangerous for us.

339
00:21:38,856 --> 00:21:39,842
Why do you say that?
你怎么这么说？

340
00:21:39,877 --> 00:21:42,721
Well, whatever killed those
insects could easily kill us.
这样, 杀死那些昆虫的东西, 也能轻易杀死我们

341
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:49,373
The Doctor said something
like that, I... I'd forgotten.

But...but...Ian...

are coated. They're obviously samples.
我是说, 看看这些种子外面的涂层, 它们显然都是样品

inventing a new insecticide

and they've sprayed these seeds with it.

it be just preserving oil?
哦, 当然我...我是说, 那就不可能只是保护油？

I doubt it, anyway, you keep away from it.

be worth it to see them two again.

to cope with the molecules
of poison in her bloodstream.
