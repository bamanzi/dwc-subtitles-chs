1
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:47,337
I... I remember now. I must...

2
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:54,909
I must kill...

3
00:06:57,757 --> 00:06:59,004
...I must kill...

4
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:02,470
I must kill.

5
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:36,454
Why you ever wanted to land on a planet

6
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,645
like this in the first place
I'll never know.

7
00:07:39,022 --> 00:07:40,157
This is getting on my nerves.

8
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:45,974
I hate to think what kind of an animal makes
a noise like that.

9
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:47,215
Yeah, they're getting closer.

10
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:48,757
Yes, all the more reason to...

11
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:50,577
stop talking and get on with the job.

12
00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:54,221
Just you listen to me, Cory.

13
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,935
I know my orders were to let you
have full reign

14
00:07:57,438 --> 00:07:58,874
and you've certainly taken
advantage of that.

15
00:07:59,298 --> 00:08:02,760
But as Captain of this expedition, my first
responsibility is to get this ship off the ground.

16
00:08:03,073 --> 00:08:05,186
So just... cut the chat.

17
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:07,487
Some other time, hmm?

18
00:08:09,443 --> 00:08:10,554
Bring that wrench.

19
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:18,862
How's it going?

20
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:20,430
Ah, it's slow.

21
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,021
Flare-back melted the retaining bolts

22
00:08:23,384 --> 00:08:24,720
it's just solid lumps of Tarnium.

23
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,106
Ah, got some of it free.

24
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,588
I want to have a look round.

25
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,324
Listen, if we don't shoot off soon

26
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:40,023
we won't make it to the rendezvous
with the freighter, you know?

27
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,733
If we're not in the pick-up orbit,
they won't wait.

28
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:44,735
You'll make it, Lowery. Here you are.

29
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:46,704
I'm doing the best I can.

30
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:49,005
I didn't want to touch down on this lousy
planet in the first place, remember?

31
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,387
Let's not start that again.

32
00:08:50,422 --> 00:08:51,648
Just get on with the job would you?

33
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:56,165
Where the devil's Garvey?

34
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,225
He should be back by now.

35
00:08:57,856 --> 00:08:59,999
No idea. Pass that screwdriver, will you?

36
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:32,655
Kill! Kill!

37
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:36,628
Ahh. Managed to get some of it free.

38
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,639
Look at it - useless!

39
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:40,312
Get me a spare, will you?

40
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:42,984
No, in the ship.

41
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:52,520
Ah, it's no good, Cory.

42
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:54,028
You needn't bother with a spare.

43
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:55,470
I'm just not gonna be able to fix it.

44
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:05,451
Jeff! Jeff!

45
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:17,610
You've killed him. You've killed Jeff!

46
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,036
It was him or you.

47
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:22,131
You didn't give him a chance.

48
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:24,150
You shot him down like an animal.

49
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:25,983
You just shot him down!

50
00:10:47,212 --> 00:10:48,110
A Varga thorn.

51
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:50,801
Wha? V... Varga?

52
00:10:50,836 --> 00:10:51,898
Careful! Don't prick yourself with it...

53
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:53,165
or you'll end up the way Garvey is.

54
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:55,098
I'd have to kill you.

55
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,299
What do you mean?

56
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:58,066
Let's get back into the ship.

57
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:00,593
What about his personal effects
for his family?

58
00:11:00,628 --> 00:11:02,085
All right. But hurry up.

59
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:42,346
I didn't intend to tell you anything

60
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:45,208
but since we're stuck on this planet
and Garvey is dead

61
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,973
there are some facts that you're
entitled to know.

62
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,172
Yeah - Jeff Garvey's dead.

63
00:11:50,754 --> 00:11:53,237
I mean, we flew together for the
last ten years

64
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,356
and now he's dead, and you killed him.

65
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:57,648
You'd better explain that fact
and make it good.

66
00:11:58,121 --> 00:11:59,417
Sit down and take a look at this.

67
00:12:06,321 --> 00:12:08,590
Huh! I might have known

68
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,731
"Space Security Service - Licensed to kill".

69
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:11,834
That's right.

70
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:12,911
Well count me out.

71
00:12:12,946 --> 00:12:15,725
This other document gives me the
authority to enlist the aid of any persons

72
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,724
civil or military. You were just enlisted.

73
00:12:23,652 --> 00:12:27,019
From now on, Lowery,
you can take your orders from me.

74
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:29,360
Yeah, all right, all right.

75
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:31,287
But I don't fully understand

76
00:12:31,746 --> 00:12:33,138
better fill in a few details.

77
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:34,052
All right.

78
00:12:34,524 --> 00:12:36,674
I suppose you've heard of the Daleks?

79
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:39,155
The Daleks invaded Earth a
thousand years ago.

80
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,959
That's right.

81
00:12:39,994 --> 00:12:42,442
Well, they haven't been active in our
galaxy for some time now

82
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:45,104
but that doesn't mean they've exactly
been sitting around.

83
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:47,365
In the last five hundred years

84
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,350
they've gained control of over seventy
planets in Ninth Galactic System

85
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:53,025
and forty more in the Constellation
of Miros.

86
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:56,138
Don't see why that should concern us.

87
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,921
I mean, they're both millions of light years
away from our galaxy.

88
00:12:59,544 --> 00:13:00,679
Mmm... that's what we all thought.

89
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,277
But about a week ago, we had a report
from the captain of a space freighter.

90
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,879
His navigator spotted a... a space ship of a
type never before used in our system.

91
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:11,938
He saw it only for a second but he gave
us a good description.

92
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:13,128
So?

93
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:16,766
What he described... was a Dalek spaceship.

94
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:52,024
Freighter XM2, freighter XM2

95
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:54,054
come in please, come in please!

96
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:55,230
Can you make it work?

97
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:56,075
It's got to work!

98
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,099
It may have been damaged in the crash.

99
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:58,073
We must keep on trying!

100
00:13:58,108 --> 00:13:59,500
Have you tested the link pulses?

101
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:01,048
I know what I'm doing.

102
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,186
All right, all right, so the link
pulses work.

103
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:04,574
There could be something else wrong with it.

104
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:05,871
What about the Vergometer?

105
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:06,715
Have you tested that?

106
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,021
Without that you'd never break through
the atmosphere.

107
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,105
How can I possibly test that?

108
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,594
We've just got to take our chance that it
hasn't been damaged.

109
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:11,847
Freighter XM2.

110
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:13,608
Freighter XM2, come in please!

111
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:14,663
Come in please!

112
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:22,651
It's useless.

113
00:14:23,223 --> 00:14:25,705
Are you sure we can't repair this ship?

114
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:27,373
Oh, not a chance.

115
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:32,749
So you think that the Daleks have established
some sort of a base here, is that it?

116
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:36,787
It could be. This is the most hostile planet
in the universe.

117
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:39,499
People from other civilisations avoid it.

118
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:40,989
I suddenly had a hunch...

119
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:45,007
that this might make an ideal place for
any secret preparations

120
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:46,334
that the Daleks wanted to make.

121
00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:48,293
That's why we brought this ship down here.

122
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:50,976
Did you tell anybody else about this
hunch of yours?

123
00:14:51,011 --> 00:14:53,186
No one - not even your commander.

124
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:54,121
Huh!

125
00:14:54,156 --> 00:14:56,060
I just asked for a couple of men and
a small rocket.

126
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,567
I didn't even tell him what for.

127
00:14:57,602 --> 00:14:58,823
Then why are you telling me?

128
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:04,134
Because of this

129
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,695
a thorn from a Varga plant.

130
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:11,067
A thing... part animal, part vegetable,
looks like a cactus.

131
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:13,804
The poison attacks the brain.

132
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:18,412
Rational thought is replaced by an
overwhelming desire to kill.

133
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:20,915
Eventually the poison seeps
through the system

134
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:23,352
and the victim is gradually transformed...

135
00:15:23,786 --> 00:15:24,790
into a Varga.

136
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:26,240
Well, what's that gotta do with the Daleks?

137
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:27,636
The only place in the universe

138
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:30,269
where Vargas grow naturally is on
the Daleks' own planet

139
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,213
Skaro.

140
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:35,031
If the Vargas are here, the Daleks are too.

141
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:03,555
<i><b>I will receive your reports.</b></i>

142
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:07,007
<i><b>First - space monitor control.</b></i>

143
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:12,433
<i><b>Space monitor control.</b></i>

144
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:17,120
<i><b>The emissaries from the seven planets
will arrive as arranged.</b></i>

145
00:16:18,782 --> 00:16:23,023
<i><b>Then the conference
will begin at first sun.</b></i>

146
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:26,916
<i><b>Security report?</b></i>

147
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:31,122
<i><b>Security control.</b></i>

148
00:16:31,895 --> 00:16:35,612
<i><b>Position of alien space craft located.</b></i>

149
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,381
<i><b>Our patrol will reach it shortly.</b></i>

150
00:16:40,496 --> 00:16:43,832
<i><b>The ship and its
occupants must be totally destroyed.</b></i>

151
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:47,012
<i><b>Destroyed! Destroyed!</b></i>

152
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,298
<i><b>It will be done.</b></i>

153
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,293
Is anything out there?

154
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:24,535
Vargas - they're closing in.

155
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:26,119
Do you mean to say they can move?

156
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,304
Very slowly - look.

157
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:29,559
They use their roots to drag
themselves along.

158
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:31,092
How long are you gonna be with this...
this rescue beacon?

159
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:33,102
Well this is the recording part.

160
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,640
Let's hope it wasn't damaged in the crash.

161
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:35,991
We'll soon find out.
Can you fix this capsule up?

162
00:17:35,992 --> 00:17:36,996
Well that's easy enough

163
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:38,774
but this is the recording mechanism
for the message.

164
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,578
If we sent the rocket into space
without this

165
00:17:41,613 --> 00:17:43,327
not only would we not be rescued

166
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,583
but if you put it up early

167
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:45,797
no one would even know we were here.

168
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:46,911
Hurry up and attach it then.

169
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:47,877
All right, all right!

170
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:49,049
I'm as keen to get out of here as you are.

171
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:50,952
Give me those pliers will you?

172
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:52,680
Nearly finished.

173
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:53,740
Good.

174
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:55,331
I don't know how long we've got.

175
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:56,930
Now the Daleks must know we're here.

176
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:58,136
They'll be coming for us soon.

177
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:00,437
Well I still think you're jumping to
conclusions, you know.

178
00:18:00,472 --> 00:18:01,701
I mean, just 'cos these...

179
00:18:01,736 --> 00:18:02,725
what are they...

180
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,741
Varga things grow here

181
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:05,211
it's no proof that the Daleks are here too.

182
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:06,686
Take my word for it, they're here all right.

183
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:09,088
Yes, but couldn't these Varga things
grow here naturally?

184
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:11,701
I mean... it's possible, isn't it?

185
00:18:11,736 --> 00:18:13,851
No, they were developed in
Dalek laboratories.

186
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,469
They grow them to give
themselves protection.

187
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:16,851
Well if they're synthetic,
that means they...

188
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:18,753
Look, stop asking questions and
get on with the work!

189
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,377
All right...

190
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:32,872
<i><b>Preceptor readings
indicated alien space craft.</b></i>

191
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,202
<i><b>We will close on it from two directions.</b></i>

192
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,468
<i><b>We obey.</b></i>

193
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:55,930
Those things are getting too
close for comfort.

194
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:57,228
I'll fix 'em.

195
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:58,444
It's no good, Lowery.

196
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,569
They'll only grow again as fast as
you can shoot them.

197
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:00,865
At least I'll have had a try at 'em.

198
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,890
Get back to the beacon.

199
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:04,327
You sure it'll work?

200
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:06,966
Well it should work

201
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:09,144
it's standard safety equipment on
all rocket ships.

202
00:19:09,497 --> 00:19:10,542
What does it do exactly?

203
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,792
Well, you record the message, SOS

204
00:19:13,244 --> 00:19:14,691
on this, just like an ordinary
tape recorder.

205
00:19:15,128 --> 00:19:17,138
The rocket launcher shoots it
high into orbit

206
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:18,962
once it's in orbit it transmits the message

207
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:19,936
simple.

208
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:22,791
From what we know about the Daleks,
we've got to be picked up.

209
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:24,508
Well it's tuned into a special frequency

210
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,234
and there are listening posts
all over the galaxy.

211
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:27,563
Our people should get the message.

212
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:28,648
And all we have to do...

213
00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:30,828
is to stay alive until they get here.

214
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:45,349
That's the biggest rocket ship
I've ever seen.

215
00:19:45,897 --> 00:19:47,289
It's like nothing we've got.

216
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:48,734
It's from an outer galaxy.

217
00:19:49,176 --> 00:19:50,041
Yeah, but what's it doing in a

218
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:51,095
God-forsaken planet like this?

219
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,302
I don't know.

220
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:53,847
But I'll tell you this

221
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:56,446
there's something very big going on here,

222
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:59,336
and if the Daleks are involved,

223
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:02,168
you can bet your life our whole
galaxy is in danger!

224
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:10,177
<i><b>The ship from
the planet Gearon...</b></i>

225
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,658
<i><b>...and the beginning
of the Great Alliance.</b></i>

226
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,365
That should just about do it.

227
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:32,795
Give me the capsule will you.

228
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,709
I'll record the message.

229
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:35,387
What is it?

230
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:36,795
There's something out there moving.

231
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,022
Vargas?

232
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,531
No. Moving too quickly.

233
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:43,102
Come on, we've gotta... gotta get away.

234
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:44,459
What about the distress signal?

235
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:46,470
Take it with us, launch it as
soon as we get a chance.

236
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:48,109
All right. Which way?

237
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:49,094
Over here.

238
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:54,639
They won't be the only ones, so watch out.

239
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:57,021
Cory!

240
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,870
Get down and don't make a sound!

241
00:21:19,342 --> 00:21:22,356
<i><b>The ship is empty.
The crew has gone.</b></i>

242
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:24,490
<i><b>We will search for them.</b></i>

243
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:28,008
<i><b>Destroy the ship. Fire!</b></i>

244
00:21:32,466 --> 00:21:34,770
It's just falling apart!

245
00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:36,821
Come on!

246
00:22:05,276 --> 00:22:07,922
Come on man! Come on!

247
00:22:08,254 --> 00:22:09,469
They'll be looking for us now!

248
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,335
<i><b>Report destruction
of alien ship to control.</b></i>

249
00:22:25,963 --> 00:22:28,018
<i><b>I obey.</b></i>

250
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:31,616
<i><b>Advise that we will now
seek out the crew.</b></i>

251
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:34,267
<i><b>Alert all patrols.</b></i>

252
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,911
<i><b>We obey.</b></i>

253
00:22:47,481 --> 00:22:50,636
<i><b>With the arrival of our ally</b></i>

254
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,595
<i><b>Malpha, we are enough.</b></i>

255
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:56,640
<i><b>The meeting can now begin.</b></i>

256
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:59,056
No it can't.

257
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:01,035
<i><b>What is wrong?</b></i>

258
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,813
There is a hostile presence among us.

259
00:23:05,227 --> 00:23:07,290
<i><b>What do you mean?</b></i>

260
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,204
On arrival here

261
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:13,366
I am told that there are hostile influences

262
00:23:13,738 --> 00:23:16,360
from the solar system among us.

263
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:21,888
<i><b>Not among us.</b></i>

264
00:23:22,338 --> 00:23:24,860
Then here - on the planet Kembel.

265
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:29,050
<i><b>Some beings have landed
from the planet Earth</b></i>

266
00:23:29,482 --> 00:23:33,567
<i><b>hostile beings from the centre of
the solar system.</b></i>

267
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:39,772
<i><b>But do not worry, their spaceship has
been destroyed.</b></i>

268
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:43,110
What about the beings?

269
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,559
<i><b>They cannot escape.</b></i>

270
00:23:46,003 --> 00:23:50,290
<i><b>At this moment they are being hunted down.</b></i>

271
00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:52,842
<i><b>They will be destroyed.</b></i>

272
00:23:53,304 --> 00:23:55,022
Are you sure?

273
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:58,105
<i><b>They cannot get away.</b></i>

274
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:02,750
Suppose they send a message
through this universe?

275
00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:06,056
<i><b>They will not have time.</b></i>

276
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:10,274
<i><b>If they do not die by our Varga plants</b></i>

277
00:24:10,888 --> 00:24:13,024
<i><b>my patrols will kill them!</b></i>

278
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,927
<i><b>They will be exterminated!
Exterminated!</b></i>

279
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:22,735
This way.

280
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,818
Agreed.

281
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:35,013
Agreed.

282
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:40,439
<i><b>All are agreed. It is done.</b></i>

283
00:24:40,832 --> 00:24:44,925
<i><b>The seven great powers of the outer
galaxies are one.</b></i>

284
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:50,145
Our galactic domination...
We are the mightiest in the universe!

285
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,998
This is indeed an historic moment in the
history of the universe!

286
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:03,912
We six from the outer galaxies

287
00:25:04,433 --> 00:25:07,411
joining with the power from the solar system

288
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:10,046
The Daleks!

289
00:25:10,704 --> 00:25:16,453
The seven of us represent the greatest war
force ever assembled!

290
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:20,119
Conquest is assured!

291
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,360
Mars!

292
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:25,872
Venus!

293
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:29,387
Jupiter!

294
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:33,091
The moon colonies!

295
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:38,868
<i><b>They will all fall before
our might.</b></i>

296
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,657
<i><b>But the first of them will be...</b></i>

297
00:25:43,991 --> 00:25:45,526
<i><b>Earth!</b></i>

298
00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:25,904
We've got to get this capsule off
and fast.

299
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,948
There's a city down there - a Dalek city.

300
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:30,456
I got quite close.

301
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:33,398
Close enough to hear an announcement
through the loudspeaker system.

302
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,982
And what did they...?

303
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,200
Our whole galaxy is to be invaded
and destroyed!

304
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,134
Kill...

305
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:44,522
What?

306
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,407
You must kill...

307
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:48,310
The Varga!

308
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:49,673
That's right.

309
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:50,873
I'll soon...

310
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:52,613
soon I shall be one of them...

311
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:55,223
Kill... Kill!

312
00:27:13,158 --> 00:27:13,913
This is Marc Cory

315
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:20,212
The Daleks are planning the complete
destruction of our galaxy.

316
00:27:20,695 --> 00:27:22,393
Together with the powers of
the outer galaxies

317
00:27:22,428 --> 00:27:24,773

If our galaxy is to be saved

327
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,618
whoever receives this message must relay
this information to Earth immediately.

328
00:28:00,024 --> 00:28:03,451
It... it is vital that...

329
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:07,219
defence mechanisms are put into
operation at once!

330
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,659
Message ends

331
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:15,447
<i><b>Fire.</b></i>

<i><b>Our plans for the
galactic conquest are safe.</b></i>

334
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:35,472
<i><b>Whatever information he discovered has
died with him.</b></i>

335
00:28:40,446 --> 00:28:42,727
<i><b>Return to the city.</b></i>

336

<i><b>We obey.</b></i>

Now all is ready.

338
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,663
We at this table

339
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,609
pledge our allegiance

340
00:29:01,644 --> 00:29:03,779
to the Dalek cause.

341
00:29:03,814 --> 00:29:06,963
Our armies will reduce the galaxies to ashes

342
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,425
their people to dust

343
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:13,435
and Earth we will conquer first.

344
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,478
Victory!

345
00:29:16,996 --> 00:29:18,643
...Victory!

346
00:29:19,137 --> 00:29:22,421
<i><b>Victory! Victory! Victory!</b></i>
