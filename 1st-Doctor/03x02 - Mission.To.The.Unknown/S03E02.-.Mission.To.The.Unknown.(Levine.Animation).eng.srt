1
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:19,337
I... I remember now. I must...

2
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:21,909
I must kill...

3
00:01:24,757 --> 00:01:26,004
...I must kill...

4
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:29,470
I must kill.

5
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,454
Why you ever wanted to land on a planet

6
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,645
like this in the first place
I'll never know.

7
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:07,157
This is getting on my nerves.

8
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:12,974
I hate to think what kind of an animal makes
a noise like that.

9
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,215
Yeah, they're getting closer.

10
00:02:14,562 --> 00:02:15,757
Yes, all the more reason to...

11
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,577
stop talking and get on with the job.

12
00:02:19,103 --> 00:02:21,221
Just you listen to me, Cory.

13
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,935
I know my orders were to let you
have full reign

14
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:26,574
and you've certainly taken
advantage of that.

15
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:30,760
But as Captain of this expedition, my first
responsibility is to get this ship off the ground.

16
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:32,686
So just... cut the chat.

17
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:34,987
Some other time, hmm?

18
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:38,054
Bring that wrench.

19
00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:46,362
How's it going?

20
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:47,930
Ah, it's slow.

21
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,521
Flare-back melted the retaining bolts

22
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:52,220
it's just solid lumps of Tarnium.

23
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,606
Ah, got some of it free.

24
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:58,088
I want to have a look round.

25
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:04,824
Listen, if we don't shoot off soon

26
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:07,523
we won't make it to the rendezvous
with the freighter, you know?

27
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:10,233
If we're not in the pick-up orbit,
they won't wait.

28
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,235
You'll make it, Lowery. Here you are.

29
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,204
I'm doing the best I can.

30
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,505
I didn't want to touch down on this lousy
planet in the first place, remember?

31
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,887
Let's not start that again.

32
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:19,148
Just get on with the job would you?

33
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,665
Where the devil's Garvey?

34
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,725
He should be back by now.

35
00:03:25,356 --> 00:03:27,499
No idea. Pass that screwdriver, will you?

36
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:00,155
Kill! Kill!

37
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:04,728
Ahh. Managed to get some of it free.

38
00:04:05,135 --> 00:04:06,739
Look at it - useless!

39
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:08,412
Get me a spare, will you?

40
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:11,084
No, in the ship.

41
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:20,620
Ah, it's no good, Cory.

42
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:22,128
You needn't bother with a spare.

43
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:23,570
I'm just not gonna be able to fix it.

44
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:33,551
Jeff! Jeff!

45
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,710
You've killed him. You've killed Jeff!

46
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,136
It was him or you.

47
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:50,231
You didn't give him a chance.

48
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,250
You shot him down like an animal.

49
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:54,083
You just shot him down!

50
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:16,210
A Varga thorn.

51
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:18,901
Wha? V... Varga?

52
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:19,998
Careful! Don't prick yourself with it...

53
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:21,265
or you'll end up the way Garvey is.

54
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:23,198
I'd have to kill you.

55
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:24,399
What do you mean?

56
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,166
Let's get back into the ship.

57
00:05:26,563 --> 00:05:28,693
What about his personal effects
for his family?

58
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,185
All right. But hurry up.

59
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:11,246
I didn't intend to tell you anything

60
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,108
but since we're stuck on this planet
and Garvey is dead

61
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,873
there are some facts that you're
entitled to know.

62
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,072
Yeah - Jeff Garvey's dead.

63
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:22,137
I mean, we flew together for the
last ten years

64
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,256
and now he's dead, and you killed him.

65
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:26,548
You'd better explain that fact
and make it good.

66
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:28,317
Sit down and take a look at this.

67
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:37,490
Huh! I might have known

68
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:39,631
"Space Security Service - Licensed to kill".

69
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,734
That's right.

70
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:41,811
Well count me out.

71
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:44,625
This other document gives me the
authority to enlist the aid of any persons

72
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,624
civil or military. You were just enlisted.

73
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:55,919
From now on, Lowery,
you can take your orders from me.

74
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:58,260
Yeah, all right, all right.

75
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:00,187
But I don't fully understand

76
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:02,038
better fill in a few details.

77
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:02,952
All right.

78
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,574
I suppose you've heard of the Daleks?

79
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:08,055
The Daleks invaded Earth a
thousand years ago.

80
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:08,859
That's right.

81
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:11,342
Well, they haven't been active in our
galaxy for some time now

82
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:14,004
but that doesn't mean they've exactly
been sitting around.

83
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,265
In the last five hundred years

84
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,250
they've gained control of over seventy
planets in Ninth Galactic System

85
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:21,925
and forty more in the Constellation
of Miros.

86
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:25,038
Don't see why that should concern us.

87
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,821
I mean, they're both millions of light years
away from our galaxy.

88
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:29,579
Mmm... that's what we all thought.

89
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,177
But about a week ago, we had a report
from the captain of a space freighter.

90
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,779
His navigator spotted a... a space ship of a
type never before used in our system.

91
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:40,838
He saw it only for a second but he gave
us a good description.

92
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:42,028
So?

93
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:45,666
What he described... was a Dalek spaceship.

94
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:20,924
Freighter XM2, freighter XM2

95
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,954
come in please, come in please!

96
00:08:22,989 --> 00:08:24,130
Can you make it work?

97
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:24,975
It's got to work!

98
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,999
It may have been damaged in the crash.

99
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:26,973
We must keep on trying!

100
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,400
Have you tested the link pulses?

101
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:29,948
I know what I'm doing.

102
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,086
All right, all right, so the link
pulses work.

103
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:33,474
There could be something else wrong with it.

104
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:34,771
What about the Vergometer?

105
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:35,615
Have you tested that?

106
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,921
Without that you'd never break through
the atmosphere.

107
00:08:36,956 --> 00:08:38,005
How can I possibly test that?

108
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,494
We've just got to take our chance that it
hasn't been damaged.

109
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:40,747
Freighter XM2.

110
00:08:40,782 --> 00:08:42,508
Freighter XM2, come in please!

111
00:08:42,543 --> 00:08:43,563
Come in please!

112
00:08:50,174 --> 00:08:51,551
It's useless.

113
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:54,605
Are you sure we can't repair this ship?

114
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:56,273
Oh, not a chance.

115
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:01,649
So you think that the Daleks have established
some sort of a base here, is that it?

116
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,687
It could be. This is the most hostile planet
in the universe.

117
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:08,399
People from other civilisations avoid it.

118
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:09,889
I suddenly had a hunch...

119
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:13,907
that this might make an ideal place for
any secret preparations

120
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:15,234
that the Daleks wanted to make.

121
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:17,193
That's why we brought this ship down here.

122
00:09:18,468 --> 00:09:19,876
Did you tell anybody else about this
hunch of yours?

123
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:22,086
No one - not even your commander.

124
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:23,021
Huh!

125
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:24,960
I just asked for a couple of men and
a small rocket.

126
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:26,467
I didn't even tell him what for.

127
00:09:26,502 --> 00:09:27,723
Then why are you telling me?

128
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,034
Because of this

129
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:35,595
a thorn from a Varga plant.

130
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,967
A thing... part animal, part vegetable,
looks like a cactus.

131
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:42,704
The poison attacks the brain.

132
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:47,312
Rational thought is replaced by an
overwhelming desire to kill.

133
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:49,815
Eventually the poison seeps
through the system

134
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:52,252
and the victim is gradually transformed...

135
00:09:52,686 --> 00:09:53,690
into a Varga.

136
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:55,140
Well, what's that gotta do with the Daleks?

137
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:56,536
The only place in the universe

138
00:09:56,571 --> 00:09:59,169
where Vargas grow naturally is on
the Daleks' own planet

139
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:00,113
Skaro.

140
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:03,931
If the Vargas are here, the Daleks are too.

141
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:32,455
<i><b>I will receive your reports.</b></i>

142
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:35,907
<i><b>First - space monitor control.</b></i>

143
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,333
<i><b>Space monitor control.</b></i>

144
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:48,020
<i><b>The emissaries from the seven planets
will arrive as arranged.</b></i>

145
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:53,423
<i><b>Then the conference
will begin at first sun.</b></i>

146
00:10:54,126 --> 00:10:57,316
<i><b>Security report?</b></i>

147
00:10:57,943 --> 00:11:01,522
<i><b>Security control.</b></i>

148
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,712
<i><b>Position of alien space craft located.</b></i>

149
00:11:05,986 --> 00:11:09,081
<i><b>Our patrol will reach it shortly.</b></i>

150
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:13,632
<i><b>The ship and its
occupants must be totally destroyed.</b></i>

151
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:16,412
<i><b>Destroyed! Destroyed!</b></i>

152
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,698
<i><b>It will be done.</b></i>

153
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:52,693
Is anything out there?

154
00:11:53,122 --> 00:11:53,935
Vargas - they're closing in.

155
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:55,519
Do you mean to say they can move?

156
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,704
Very slowly - look.

157
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:58,959
They use their roots to drag
themselves along.

158
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,492
How long are you gonna be with this...
this rescue beacon?

159
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:02,502
Well this is the recording part.

160
00:12:02,537 --> 00:12:04,040
Let's hope it wasn't damaged in the crash.

161
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:05,391
We'll soon find out.
Can you fix this capsule up?

162
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,396
Well that's easy enough

163
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:08,174
but this is the recording mechanism
for the message.

164
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:10,978
If we sent the rocket into space
without this

165
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:12,727
not only would we not be rescued

166
00:12:12,762 --> 00:12:13,983
but if you put it up early

167
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:15,197
no one would even know we were here.

168
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:16,311
Hurry up and attach it then.

169
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:17,277
All right, all right!

170
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:18,449
I'm as keen to get out of here as you are.

171
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:20,352
Give me those pliers will you?

172
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:22,080
Nearly finished.

173
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:23,140
Good.

174
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,731
I don't know how long we've got.

175
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:26,330
Now the Daleks must know we're here.

176
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:27,536
They'll be coming for us soon.

177
00:12:27,571 --> 00:12:29,837
Well I still think you're jumping to
conclusions, you know.

178
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:31,101
I mean, just 'cos these...

179
00:12:31,136 --> 00:12:32,125
what are they...

180
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,141
Varga things grow here

181
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:34,611
it's no proof that the Daleks are here too.

182
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:36,086
Take my word for it, they're here all right.

183
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:38,488
Yes, but couldn't these Varga things
grow here naturally?

184
00:12:39,141 --> 00:12:41,101
I mean... it's possible, isn't it?

185
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,251
No, they were developed in
Dalek laboratories.

186
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:44,869
They grow them to give
themselves protection.

187
00:12:44,904 --> 00:12:46,251
Well if they're synthetic,
that means they...

188
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:48,153
Look, stop asking questions and
get on with the work!

189
00:12:50,585 --> 00:12:51,777
All right...

190
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:02,272
<i><b>Preceptor readings
indicated alien space craft.</b></i>

191
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,602
<i><b>We will close on it from two directions.</b></i>

192
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:10,868
<i><b>We obey.</b></i>

193
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:25,830
Those things are getting too
close for comfort.

194
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:26,828
I'll fix 'em.

195
00:13:26,863 --> 00:13:28,044
It's no good, Lowery.

196
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,169
They'll only grow again as fast as
you can shoot them.

197
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:30,465
At least I'll have had a try at 'em.

198
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,490
Get back to the beacon.

199
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:34,227
You sure it'll work?

200
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:36,866
Well it should work

201
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:39,044
it's standard safety equipment on
all rocket ships.

202
00:13:39,397 --> 00:13:40,442
What does it do exactly?

203
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:42,692
Well, you record the message, SOS

204
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:44,591
on this, just like an ordinary
tape recorder.

205
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:47,038
The rocket launcher shoots it
high into orbit

206
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:48,862
once it's in orbit it transmits the message

207
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:49,836
simple.

208
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,691
From what we know about the Daleks,
we've got to be picked up.

209
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:54,408
Well it's tuned into a special frequency

210
00:13:54,443 --> 00:13:56,134
and there are listening posts
all over the galaxy.

211
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,463
Our people should get the message.

212
00:13:57,498 --> 00:13:58,548
And all we have to do...

213
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,728
is to stay alive until they get here.

214
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,249
That's the biggest rocket ship
I've ever seen.

215
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:17,189
It's like nothing we've got.

216
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,634
It's from an outer galaxy.

217
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:19,941
Yeah, but what's it doing in a

218
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:20,995
God-forsaken planet like this?

219
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,202
I don't know.

220
00:14:22,523 --> 00:14:23,747
But I'll tell you this

221
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:26,346
there's something very big going on here,

222
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:29,236
and if the Daleks are involved,

223
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:32,068
you can bet your life our whole
galaxy is in danger!

224
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:40,077
<i><b>The ship from
the planet Gearon...</b></i>

225
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,558
<i><b>...and the beginning
of the Great Alliance.</b></i>

226
00:14:58,394 --> 00:15:00,265
That should just about do it.

227
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:02,695
Give me the capsule will you.

228
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,609
I'll record the message.

229
00:15:04,152 --> 00:15:05,287
What is it?

230
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,695
There's something out there moving.

231
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,922
Vargas?

232
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:10,431
No. Moving too quickly.

233
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:13,002
Come on, we've gotta... gotta get away.

234
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,359
What about the distress signal?

235
00:15:14,394 --> 00:15:16,370
Take it with us, launch it as
soon as we get a chance.

236
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:18,009
All right. Which way?

237
00:15:18,044 --> 00:15:18,994
Over here.

238
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,539
They won't be the only ones, so watch out.

239
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:26,921
Cory!

240
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:28,770
Get down and don't make a sound!

241
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:51,556
<i><b>The ship is empty.
The crew has gone.</b></i>

242
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,390
<i><b>We will search for them.</b></i>

243
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:57,908
<i><b>Destroy the ship. Fire!</b></i>

244
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:04,670
It's just falling apart!

245
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:06,721
Come on!

246
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:37,822
Come on man! Come on!

247
00:16:38,154 --> 00:16:39,369
They'll be looking for us now!

248
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,235
<i><b>Report destruction
of alien ship to control.</b></i>

249
00:16:56,563 --> 00:16:58,618
<i><b>I obey.</b></i>

250
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,216
<i><b>Advise that we will now
seek out the crew.</b></i>

251
00:17:02,592 --> 00:17:04,867
<i><b>Alert all patrols.</b></i>

252
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,511
<i><b>We obey.</b></i>

253
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:21,236
<i><b>With the arrival of our ally</b></i>

254
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:24,195
<i><b>Malpha, we are enough.</b></i>

255
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,240
<i><b>The meeting can now begin.</b></i>

256
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,656
No it can't.

257
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:31,635
<i><b>What is wrong?</b></i>

258
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,413
There is a hostile presence among us.

259
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:37,890
<i><b>What do you mean?</b></i>

260
00:17:38,277 --> 00:17:39,804
On arrival here

261
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:43,966
I am told that there are hostile influences

262
00:17:44,338 --> 00:17:46,960
from the solar system among us.

263
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:52,488
<i><b>Not among us.</b></i>

264
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,460
Then here - on the planet Kembel.

265
00:17:56,072 --> 00:17:59,650
<i><b>Some beings have landed
from the planet Earth</b></i>

266
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:04,167
<i><b>hostile beings from the centre of
the solar system.</b></i>

267
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:10,372
<i><b>But do not worry, their spaceship has
been destroyed.</b></i>

268
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:13,710
What about the beings?

269
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,159
<i><b>They cannot escape.</b></i>

270
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:20,890
<i><b>At this moment they are being hunted down.</b></i>

271
00:18:21,412 --> 00:18:23,442
<i><b>They will be destroyed.</b></i>

272
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:25,622
Are you sure?

273
00:18:26,296 --> 00:18:28,705
<i><b>They cannot get away.</b></i>

274
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:33,350
Suppose they send a message
through this universe?

275
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:36,656
<i><b>They will not have time.</b></i>

276
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:40,874
<i><b>If they do not die by our Varga plants</b></i>

277
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,624
<i><b>my patrols will kill them!</b></i>

278
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,527
<i><b>They will be exterminated!
Exterminated!</b></i>

279
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:53,335
This way.

280
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,418
Agreed.

281
00:19:02,878 --> 00:19:05,613
Agreed.

282
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:11,039
<i><b>All are agreed. It is done.</b></i>

283
00:19:11,432 --> 00:19:15,525
<i><b>The seven great powers of the outer
galaxies are one.</b></i>

284
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:20,745
Our galactic domination...
We are the mightiest in the universe!

285
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,598
This is indeed an historic moment in the
history of the universe!

286
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:34,512
We six from the outer galaxies

287
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:38,011
joining with the power from the solar system

288
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:40,646
The Daleks!

289
00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:47,053
The seven of us represent the greatest war
force ever assembled!

290
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:50,719
Conquest is assured!

291
00:19:52,704 --> 00:19:53,960
Mars!

292
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:56,472
Venus!

293
00:19:58,606 --> 00:19:59,987
Jupiter!

294
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,691
The moon colonies!

295
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:09,468
<i><b>They will all fall before
our might.</b></i>

296
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,257
<i><b>But the first of them will be...</b></i>

297
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:16,126
<i><b>Earth!</b></i>

298
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,504
We've got to get this capsule off
and fast.

299
00:20:56,885 --> 00:20:59,548
There's a city down there - a Dalek city.

300
00:21:00,001 --> 00:21:01,056
I got quite close.

301
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:03,998
Close enough to hear an announcement
through the loudspeaker system.

302
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:06,582
And what did they...?

303
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,800
Our whole galaxy is to be invaded
and destroyed!

304
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,734
Kill...

305
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:15,122
What?

306
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:17,007
You must kill...

307
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,910
The Varga!

308
00:21:19,273 --> 00:21:20,273
That's right.

309
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:21,473
I'll soon...

310
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,213
soon I shall be one of them...

311
00:21:23,743 --> 00:21:25,823
Kill... Kill!

312
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:44,513
This is Marc Cory

313
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:45,799
Special Security Service

314
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:47,164
reporting from the planet Kembel.

315
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:50,812
The Daleks are planning the complete
destruction of our galaxy.

316
00:21:51,295 --> 00:21:52,993
Together with the powers of
the outer galaxies

317
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:55,373
a war force is being assembled...

318
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:58,468
<i><b>Seismic detector is registering.</b></i>

319
00:21:58,992 --> 00:22:02,898
<i><b>The crew from the rocket
ship must be in this direction.</b></i>

320
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:06,758
<i><b>Are they to be taken
for questioning?</b></i>

321
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:08,127
<i><b>No.</b></i>

322
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:10,875
<i><b>They are to be exterminated.</b></i>

323
00:22:11,553 --> 00:22:13,089
<i><b>Destroy them on sight.</b></i>

324
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:16,027
<i><b>Destroy and exterminate!</b></i>

325
00:22:17,658 --> 00:22:18,868
<i><b>We obey.</b></i>

326
00:22:23,184 --> 00:22:24,847
If our galaxy is to be saved

327
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:30,218
whoever receives this message must relay
this information to Earth immediately.

328
00:22:30,624 --> 00:22:34,051
It... it is vital that...

329
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:37,819
defence mechanisms are put into
operation at once!

330
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:39,259
Message ends

331
00:22:43,949 --> 00:22:46,047
<i><b>Fire.</b></i>

332
00:22:54,724 --> 00:22:56,406
<i><b>He is dead.</b></i>

333
00:22:56,758 --> 00:23:01,280
<i><b>Our plans for the
galactic conquest are safe.</b></i>

334
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:08,072
<i><b>Whatever information he discovered has died with him.</b></i>

335
00:23:11,546 --> 00:23:13,827
<i><b>Return to the city.</b></i>

336
00:23:15,586 --> 00:23:17,364
<i><b>We obey.</b></i>

337
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:28,497
Now all is ready.

338
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:30,763
We at this table

339
00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:32,709
pledge our allegiance

340
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,879
to the Dalek cause.

341
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:38,063
Our armies will reduce the galaxies to ashes

342
00:23:38,612 --> 00:23:40,525
their people to dust

343
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:44,535
and Earth we will conquer first.

344
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:47,578
Victory!

345
00:23:48,096 --> 00:23:49,743
...Victory!

346
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:53,521
<i><b>Victory! Victory! Victory!</b></i>
