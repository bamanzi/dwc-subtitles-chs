Why you ever wanted to land on a planet like this in the first place, I'll never know.
为什么你一开始就想降落在这样一个星球上, 我永远不知道

13
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:07,157
This is getting on my nerves.
我觉得有点紧张了

14
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:12,974
I hate to think what kind of an animal makes a noise like that.
我有点不敢去想，什么样的动物会发出那样的声音？

15
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,215
Yeah, they're getting closer.
是啊, 他们越来越近了

16
00:02:14,562 --> 00:02:17,757
Yes, all the more reason to stop talking and get on with the job.
是, 我们更应该少说话, 赶紧把活儿干完

17
00:02:19,103 --> 00:02:21,221
Just you listen to me, Cory.
你听我说, Cory

18
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,935
I know my orders were to let you have full reign
我知道我得到的命令是完全听你的

19
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:26,574
and you've certainly taken advantage of that.
而且你也很好地利用了这条命令

20
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:30,760
But as Captain of this expedition, my first responsibility is to get this ship off the ground.
但作为这个探险队的队长, 我的第一责任是让这艘飞船重新飞起来

21
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:32,686
So just... cut the chat.
那就．．别闲聊了

22
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:34,987
Some other time, hmm?
换个时间吧, 怎样？

00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:38,054
Bring that wrench.

Flare-back melted the retaining bolts
回火溶掉了固定螺栓

27
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:52,220
it's just solid lumps of Tarnium.

28
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,606
Ah, got some of it free.
啊，卸下来一些(fixme)

I want to have a look round.
我必须四周巡查一下

30
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:04,824
Listen, if we don't shoot off soon
嘿, 如果我们还不赶紧起飞

31
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:07,523
we won't make it to the rendezvous with the freighter, you know?
我们就来不及跟货船汇合了, 你知道的吧？

32
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:10,233
If we're not in the pick-up orbit, they won't wait.
如果我们那时没赶到接头的轨道, 他们不会等我们的

33
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,235
You'll make it, Lowery. Here you are.

I'm doing the best I can.

I didn't want to touch down on this lousy planet in the first place, remember?
我一开始就不想碰这个恶心的星球的, 记得吧？

36
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,887
Let's not start that again.
咱们别再说这个了

37
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:19,148
Just get on with the job would you?
赶紧把活儿干完行吗？

38
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,665
Where the devil's Garvey?

39
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,725
He should be back by now.
他这会儿应该在后面

40
00:03:25,356 --> 00:03:27,499
No idea. Pass that screwdriver, will you?
不知道．把螺丝刀给我, 好吗？

41
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:00,155
Kill! Kill!

Ahh. Managed to get some of it free.

00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:08,412
Get me a spare, will you?
给我一个备用的, 行吗？

45
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:11,084
No, in the ship.
没有, 在飞船里呢

46
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:20,620
Ah, it's no good, Cory.
啊, 这可不妙, Cory

47
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:22,128
You needn't bother with a spare.
你不用去找备用件了

48
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:23,570
I'm just not gonna be able to fix it.
我就没法修好它

49
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:33,551
Jeff! Jeff!

50
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,710
You've killed him. You've killed Jeff!
你杀死了他！ 你杀死了他！

51

You didn't give him a chance.

00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,250
You shot him down like an animal.

00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:54,083
You just shot him down!
你枪杀了他！

A Varga thorn.
一根 Varga 尖刺

56
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:18,901
Wha? V... Varga?
什么？V... Varga？

57
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:19,998
Careful! Don't prick yourself with it...
小心！ 别扎到你自己．．．

58
00:05:20,448 --> 00:05:21,865
or you'll end up the way Garvey is.
要不然你就变得跟 Garvey 一样了

59
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:23,198
I'd have to kill you.

00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:24,399
What do you mean?

Let's get back into the ship.

All right. But hurry up.

I didn't intend to tell you anything

but since we're stuck on this planet and Garvey is dead

66
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,873
there are some facts that you're entitled to know.

67
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,072
Yeah - Jeff Garvey's dead.
知道 - Jeff Garvey 他死了

68
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:22,137
I mean, we flew together for the last ten years

69
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,256
and now he's dead, and you killed him.

70
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:26,948
You'd better explain that fact and make it good.
你最好解释一下, 最好有个不错的理由

71
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:28,317
Sit down and take a look at this.

72
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:37,490
Huh! I might have known
哈！ 我早该知道的

00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:39,631
"Space Security Service - Licensed to kill".
太空安全服务队 - 杀人执照

74
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,734
That's right.
对

00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:41,811
Well count me out.
别把我算在内(fixme)

76
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:44,625
This other document gives me the authority to enlist the aid of any persons

77
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,624
civil or military. You were just enlisted.

00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:55,919
From now on, Lowery, you can take your orders from me.
从现在开始, Lowery, 你得听命于我了

79
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:58,260

better fill in a few details.

行

83
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,574
I suppose you've heard of the Daleks?

84
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:08,055
The Daleks invaded Earth a thousand years ago.
Daleks 在一千多年前入侵过地球

85
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:08,859
That's right.
对

86
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:11,342
Well, they haven't been active in our galaxy for some time now
而且, 他们有好一段没在我们这个星系活动了

87
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:14,004
but that doesn't mean they've exactly been sitting around.
但这并不意味着他们就在干坐着

88
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,265
In the last five hundred years
在过去的500年里面

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,250
they've gained control of over seventy planets in Ninth Galactic System

and forty more in the Constellation of Miros.

00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:25,038
Don't see why that should concern us.
看不出这跟我们有什么关系

92
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,821
I mean, they're both millions of light years away from our galaxy.
我是说, 这都离我们星系有几百万光年呢

93
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:29,579
Mmm... that's what we all thought.
唔．．．我们以前也这么想

94
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,177
But about a week ago, we had a report from the captain of a space freighter.
但是一周以前，我们接到一艘太空货船船长的报告

95
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,779
His navigator spotted a... a space ship of a type never before used in our system.
他的导航员看到了一艘太空船，那种类型从来没有在我们星系里出现过

96
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:40,838
He saw it only for a second but he gave us a good description.
他只看到了一两秒，但足够他给出了清楚的描述了

97
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:42,028
So?
怎么说？

98
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:45,666
What he described... was a Dalek spaceship.

Freighter XM2, freighter XM2

100
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,954
come in please, come in please!

102
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:24,975
It's got to work!
必须搞定！

103
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,999
It may have been damaged in the crash.

00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:26,973
We must keep on trying!
我们还得再试试

I know what I'm doing.
我知道我在干什么

107
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,086
All right, all right, so the link pulses work.
好吧, 好吧, 这么说链接脉冲没有问题

108
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:33,474
There could be something else wrong with it.
可能是别的什么地方坏了

109
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:34,771
What about the Vergometer?
伟尔热计情况怎样？

110
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:35,615
Have you tested that?
你测试过吗？

111
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,921
Without that you'd never break through the atmosphere.
没有这东西你别想冲出大气层

112
00:08:36,956 --> 00:08:38,005
How can I possibly test that?
我怎么能够测出来呢？

113
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,494
We've just got to take our chance that it hasn't been damaged.
我们只能赌一把, 赌它还没有损坏了

114
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:40,747

Are you sure we can't repair this ship?
你确定我们修不好这艘船了吗？

119
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:56,273
Oh, not a chance.
哦, 一点机会也没有

120
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:01,649
So you think that the Daleks have established some sort of a base here, is that it?
这么说你觉得这些 Daleks 在这里建立了基地什么的, 是吧？

121
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,687
It could be. This is the most hostile planet in the universe.
有可能．这是宇宙中最有敌意的星球

122
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:08,399
People from other civilisations avoid it.

123
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:09,889
I suddenly had a hunch...

That's why we brought this ship down here.
这就是为什么我们把飞船降落在这里

126
00:09:18,468 --> 00:09:19,876
Did you tell anybody else about this hunch of yours?
你跟别人说过你的这个想法吗？

127
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:22,086
No one - not even your commander.
谁也没有 - 即使是你的指挥官

128
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:23,021
Huh!
嘘

129
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:24,960
I just asked for a couple of men and a small rocket.

A thing... part animal, part vegetable, looks like a cactus.
这种东西．．．半是动物, 半是植物, 看起来有点像仙人掌

135
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:42,704
The poison attacks the brain.
它的毒性直攻大脑

136
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:47,312
Rational thought is replaced by an overwhelming desire to kill.
理性思考会消失, 取而代之的是不可抑制的杀戮欲望

137
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:49,815
Eventually the poison seeps through the system
最终这种毒会渗透出来

138
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:52,252
and the victim is gradually transformed...
然后受害者就会完全变成．．．

139
00:09:52,686 --> 00:09:53,690
into a Varga.
一个 Varga

140
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:55,140
Well, what's that gotta do with the Daleks?
那这跟 Daleks 又有什么关系？

141
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:57,536
The only place in the universe where Vargas grow naturally is
这个宇宙中, Varga 唯一能自然生长的地方

142
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:59,169
on the Daleks' own planet
