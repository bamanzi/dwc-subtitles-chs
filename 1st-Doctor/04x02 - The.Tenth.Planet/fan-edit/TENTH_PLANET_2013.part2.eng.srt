1
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,225
That's the most fantastic story I've ever heard.

2
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,392
I can only repeat, sir, what I have already told you.

3
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,992
You will get visitors from that other planet.

4
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:46,193
Nonsense.

5
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,502
It's imperative that I talk to you, General.

6
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:18,514
Get away, old man. Can't you see...

7
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,589
You, will you pay attention? Will you?!

8
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:25,441
Get this man back into the observations room. Sergeant, that was an order!

9
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:27,080
Take that man back to the obs...

10
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:32,997
Back to your places.

11
00:13:37,557 --> 00:13:38,424
Oh no...

12
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:39,999
Come back Polly, they'll blow your head off!

13
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:40,737
Ah!

14
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:50,408
Now look, I don't know who you are or what you are
你看，我不知道你们是谁，是什么东西
but we've got two men in space, if we don't act now we won't get them back alive.

15
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:51,979
They will not return.

16
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:53,135
Why not?

17
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:56,413
It is unimportant now.

18
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,894
But... We must get them back! When...

19
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:03,740
There is really no point. They could never reach Earth now.

20
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,048
But don't you care?

21
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:08,037
Care? No, why should I care?

22
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:10,246
Because they're people and they're going to die!

23
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:17,696
I do not understand you. There are people dying all over your world yet you do not care about them.

24
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,470
Yes, but we could avoid their deaths...

25
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:23,156
You will be wondering what has happened.

26
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,356
Your astronomers will have just discovered a new planet. Is that not so?

27
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,506
Yes, that's right.

28
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:32,793
That is where we come from. It is called Mondas.

29
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:33,955
Mondas?

30
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:36,315
Mondas? But isn't that one of the ancient names of Earth?

31
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:45,733
Yes. Aeons ago our planets were twins then we drifted away from you...

32
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,733
...on a journey to the edge of space. Now we have returned.

33
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,004
You were right, Doctor.

34
00:14:47,224 --> 00:14:48,628
But who or what are you?

35
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,279
We are called Cybermen.

36
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:52,523
Cybermen?

37
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:57,184
Yes, Cybermen. We were exactly like you once

39
00:14:57,442 --> 0:15:01,0884
but our cybernetic scientists realised that our race was getting weak.

38
00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:03,099
Weak, how?

39
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:09,909
Our life span was getting shorter so our scientists and doctors devised spare parts for our bodies

40
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:15,009
...until we could be almost completely replaced.

41
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:19,239
But... that means you're not like us. You're robots!

42
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:25,665
Our brains are just like yours except that certain weaknesses have been removed.

43
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,525
Weaknesses? What weaknesses?

44
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,331
You call them emotions, do you not?

45
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:34,931
But... that's terrible! You... you mean you wouldn't care about someone in pain?

46
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:38,970
There would be no need. We do not feel pain.

47
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,403
But we do.

48
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:42,807
General!

49
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:46,101
Ha, that'll fix ya! Europe will know there's an emergency here now.

50
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,481
That was really most unfortunate. You should not have done that.

51
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:59,016
Switch off the radio and tell Europe that nothing further has happened and that all is well here.

52
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:00,867
I'll do no such thing.

53
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:02,451
That is an order.

54
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:05,991
Go take a jump!

55
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:07,755
Trigger pack.

56
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:20,579
Stay where you are.

57
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:22,035
You've killed him!

58
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:25,182
I have not killed him. He will recover.

59
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:30,982
Now, someone must answer your commander in Europe. He is waiting.

60
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:32,466
I refuse.

61
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:35,768
You.

62
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:36,874
Yes?

63
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:39,895
Which are the communication controls?

64
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:41,522
O... over here.

65
00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:42,455
Dyson!

66
00:16:46,402 --> 00:16:47,716
Stand aside

67
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:52,591
What are you going to do?

68
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:54,259
You will see.

69
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:57,395
If you destroy those we shall be unable to keep contact with the capsule.

70
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,650
Your commander is still waiting for your report.

71
00:17:01,982 --> 00:17:05,062
For God's sake Barclay, do as he asks. Do you want the place destroyed?

72
00:17:06,228 --> 00:17:07,192
All right.

73
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,153
Come in Geneva.

74
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:18,509
Snowcap. What's going on? We received an emergency from you on the radio link.

75
00:17:18,894 --> 00:17:23,417
I-i-i-it was a fault. We're, we are looking at it now. I'm sorry about the false alarm.

76
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:28,042
Where is the static coming from? We can hardly hear you, even on these bands.

77
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:31,481
It it it, well, I-I-I, er think it must have been the reactor.

78
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:36,484
We had the moderator on, er, for a time this afternoon and er, well, well that's probably it.

79
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:42,450
I see. Contact us if you have any further reports on this new planet.

80
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:43,549
Yes sir.

81
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:47,719
Well done, Barclay. Now the space capsule will have another chance.

82
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,731
Now you must let us try and get in touch with our astronauts.

83
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:56,344
I told you it is impossible for them to get back now.

84
00:17:56,421 --> 00:17:58,845
The force on them is too strong.

85
00:17:59,249 --> 00:18:01,034
But you must let us try, please.

86
00:18:01,336 --> 00:18:05,242
It is a foregone conclusion. You are wasting time.

87
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:09,223
However, if you wish to contact them I have no objection.

88
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:14,703
He and his colleagues may use their equipment.

89
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,896
Any attempt at deceit however, kill them at once.

90
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:22,696
Remove the soldier. I will carry on detail.

91
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:27,240
Snowcap to Zeus 4, come in please. Zeus 4, come in please.

92
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,869
We have you, over.

93
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:30,902
Prepare to check orbital density.

94
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:31,837
Ready.

95
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,402
Right Doctor, while they take him out we'll make a break for it.

96
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,038
Eh?

97
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:37,147
Then we can get back to the TARDIS!

98
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:38,271
Well how can we do that, boy?

99
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:42,226
Well, we can make a break for it. Down that corridor, the trapdoor and then bolt it from behind.

100
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:44,292
Nonsense, nonsense, they'll burn it down in a flash!

101
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,811
We can do with that for a start!

102
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:46,501
No, Ben!

103
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:48,615
If they see you... Ben, for goodness sake!

104
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:53,307
Stop! Come here.

105
00:19:01,443 --> 00:19:05,277
You do not seem to take us seriously.

106
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:13,442
Blimey!

107
00:19:14,527 --> 00:19:15,411
Heavens!

108
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:19,258
Take him out and look after him.

109
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:28,409
It is quite useless to resist us. We are stronger

110
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:33,609
and more efficient than your Earth people. We must be obeyed.

111
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:47,344
Uh! Locked... uh! No

112
00:20:03,823 --> 00:20:04,663
What happened?

113
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:10,367
I'm afraid the spaceship exploded, my dear.

114
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:12,924
You mean they're dead?

115
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:19,535
Now perhaps you can see that your planet is in great and imminent danger.

116
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:28,545
In order to save you we shall require information to be transmitted to Mondas.

117
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:26,660
Save us?

118
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,136
What about those poor men?

119
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:34,404
Perhaps you will co-operate. Mondas drew the ship away. It was unavoidable.

120
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:36,008
Why? What is happening?

121
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:37,734
I will require your name.

122
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:38,845
Tell us!

123
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,562
The energy of Mondas is nearly exhausted

124
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:47,572
and now we turn to it's twin and will gather energy from Earth.

125
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:48,720
Gather energy?!

126
00:20:48,946 --> 00:20:49,794
Age, name and occupation.

127
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:50,840
But for how long?

128
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,577
My name is John Dyson, supervising engineer.

129
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:55,418
Until it is all gone. Age.

130
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,781
But that means that the Earth will... will die!

131
00:20:58,002 --> 00:21:01,738
Yes. Everything on Earth will stop. Age please.

132
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,401
But you can't calmly stand there and tell us we're all going to die!

133
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:06,733
You are not going to die.

134
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:09,665
And how are you going to stop this energy drain from Mondas?

135
00:21:10,073 --> 00:21:13,658
Name and occupation please. We cannot. It is beyond our powers.

136
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:14,829
How are we going to survive?!

137
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:17,723
Speak please. By coming with us. Age.

138
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:19,182
With you?

139
00:21:19,497 --> 00:21:24,796
Yes. We are going to take you all back to Mondas. Your age please.

140
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,700
- His age is unimportant here!
- That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life!

141
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:29,058
You cannot for one moment...

142
00:21:36,918 --> 00:21:43,261
Hey, wait a minute! If I was to turn this on the door...

143
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:47,901
...it might blind him! Yeah.

144
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,238
Hah! I saw that film 20 years ago.

145
00:22:08,565 --> 00:22:12,741
Oy, come in here mate, you're wanted! Oy, come in here!

146
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:16,290
Blemmy ehny ah fu! Uh!

147
00:22:17,364 --> 00:22:18,777
Now then, Fred!

148
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,489
Ahh!

149
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:27,921
Do not resist. Give me that weapon.

150
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:32,359
No, I'm sorry mate, I'm giving the orders here. Now look, get back.

151
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:34,550
Look, I'm telling you, get back!

152
00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:39,488
You didn't give me no alternative!

153
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,741
There's no scientific certainty that this is a dying planet!

154
00:22:43,374 --> 00:22:45,321
Perhaps we would prefer to take our chances here.

155
00:22:45,337 --> 00:22:47,669
You must come and live with us.

156
00:22:47,897 --> 00:22:51,150
But we cannot live with you, you're... you're different, you've got no feelings.

157
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,146
Feelings? I do not understand that word.

158
00:22:55,409 --> 00:23:01,282
Emotions. Love, pride, hate, fear. Have you no emotions, sir?

159
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:06,262
Come to Mondas and you will have no need of emotions.

160
00:23:06,304 --> 00:23:08,462
You will become like us.

161
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:09,897
Like you?

162
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:17,856
We have freedom from disease, protection against heat and cold, true mastery.

163
00:23:17,957 --> 00:23:19,560
Do you prefer to die in misery?

164
00:23:19,918 --> 00:23:23,509
But look, surely I... it's possible for us not to lose Earth's energy?

165
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,606
It is inevitable.

166
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,517
Then you don't mind if we all die.

167
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,384
Why should we mind?

168
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,609
Why? Why?!

169
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:36,137
Because millions and millions of people are going to suffer and die horribly!

170
00:23:36,433 --> 00:23:38,586
We shall not be affected.

171
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:41,148
Don't you think of anything except yourselves?!

172
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:47,253
We are equipped to survive. We are only interested in survival.

173
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:53,753
Anything else is of no importance. Your deaths will not affect us.

174
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:58,298
But I can't make you understand, you're condemning us all to die, have you no heart?

175
00:23:58,564 --> 00:24:03,541
No, that is one of the weaknesses that we have removed.

176
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,671
All right, get me Geneva, quick!

177
00:24:13,304 --> 00:24:15,984
Come on, let's have some action. Get rid of these... things!

178
00:24:16,232 --> 00:24:19,884
I don't think you should have done that, General. We may have learned a very great deal.

179
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:22,703
Yeah, we may have lost a very great deal, our lives!

180
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:33,742
Missile control? Program all Cobra anti-missiles for launch imminent. Stand in readiness and await instructions.

181
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,123
What a ghastly man.

182
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:37,579
Yeah, I wouldn't want him on the bridge.

183
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:39,514
We'll soon have this place sealed up like a bottle.

184
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:42,467
I think you rather underestimate the Cybermen, General.

185
00:24:43,286 --> 00:24:45,537
Oh, that's what you reckon is it, old man?

186
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:49,537
Well, you're entitled to your opinions so long as you keep them to yourself!

187
00:24:50,764 --> 00:24:51,348
General Cutler, sir!

188
00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:52,079
Yes, what is it?

189
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:53,803
Strong signal on the early warning, unidentified.

190
00:24:56,891 --> 00:24:59,668
Yes sir, it's er, er... There are hundreds of them, sir!

191
00:24:59,879 --> 00:25:00,935
Hundreds of what, man?

192
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:02,522
Spaceships sir. In formation!
