1
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:35,462
Dyson, get through to Zeus 5!

2
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:36,970
What's happened to you, Doctor?

3
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:43,636
I'm not sure, my dear. Comes from an outside influence. Unless this old body of mine is wearing a bit thin.

4
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,330
What do you mean "wearing a bit thin"?

5
00:25:45,486 --> 00:25:47,521
Oh, don't worry child, don't worry, don't worry... 

6
00:25:56,864 --> 00:26:04,657
Silence. Anyone who moves will be killed instantly.

7
00:26:05,224 --> 00:26:14,063
Your planet is finished. It will disintegrate. We know why you came here. So why not stay and live with us in peace, hmm?

8
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:21,438
We cannot talk while that missile is aimed at Mondas. It must be disarmed first.

9
00:26:21,668 --> 00:26:22,856
A moment, please.

10
00:26:23,205 --> 00:26:25,732
Are you able to disarm this rocket?

11
00:26:25,987 --> 00:26:26,589
Well, yes - but...

12
00:26:26,974 --> 00:26:27,797
It will give us the time we need!

13
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:29,030
The time for Mondas to burn itself out, you mean?

14
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:35,617
Yes, now quiet! We accept your terms. The warhead will be removed from the rocket.

15
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:39,676
It must be removed to below ground level.

16
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:41,871
Well, there's the Radiation Room. It's the deepest in the base.

17
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:48,888
That will do. And to make sure you do this, we will take two hostages.

18
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:52,003
That girl will go to the spacecraft.

19
00:26:52,456 --> 00:26:55,812
Surely you're not going to return to Mondas now?

20
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:58,940
We will not discuss our plans with you.

21
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:05,161
What is your second objective? It's quite obvious, isn't it? The destruction of the Earth!

22
00:27:05,588 --> 00:27:20,998
Listen to me. This close proximity of our two planets means that one has to be eliminated for the safety of the other. The one to be destroyed will be Earth. We cannot allow Mondas to burn up.

23
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:24,733
Take the old man out to the spacecraft.

24
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,530
You will regret this.

25
00:27:35,078 --> 00:27:36,704
Doctor... Doctor?

26
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:39,079
Hmm... What is it, child?

27
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:43,320
Engines! They're not going to take off, are they?

28
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:52,394
No, no. Wait! The vibrations. Perhaps it's coming from Mondas!

29
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:54,006
What do you mean, Mondas?

30
00:27:54,245 --> 00:28:00,664
This spacecraft receives its energy from Mondas. Perhaps it's absorbing too much.

31
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:03,523
Don't mean it's going to blow up, do you?

32
00:28:03,796 --> 00:28:06,525
No, I don't know, child. It is an unknown power...

33
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:10,051
Doctor, I'm scared!

34
00:28:10,376 --> 00:28:13,481
Just look at Mondas! I can't believe it!

35
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:24,829
Fantastic! It looks as if it's melting!

36
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,585
It's falling to bits!

37
00:28:29,102 --> 00:28:31,072
The end of Mondas.

38
00:28:31,614 --> 00:28:33,078
Hey, look!

39
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,171
What's happened to them?

40
00:28:42,857 --> 00:28:44,920
They've disintegrated!

41
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:49,986
They must have been entirely dependent on power from Mondas!

42
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,041
Doctor!

43
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:56,307
Ben! Oh please, Ben, help me... get me out of this thing!

44
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,118
All right, don't panic, I'll have you out soon!

45
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:03,649
Ow! My hands were stuck and I couldn't get out!... Ben, I've been so scared!

46
00:29:03,864 --> 00:29:05,216
Take it easy love, take it easy.

47
00:29:05,404 --> 00:29:08,194
And that Cyberman thing, it just fizzled into nothing, Ben, it was awful...

48
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:09,778
Now what's the matter with the Doctor?

49
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,536
I don't know. When the lights went out, he just seemed to faint.

50
00:29:11,704 --> 00:29:14,463
Hey, come on Doctor, wakey wakey! It's all over now.

51
00:29:22,402 --> 00:29:23,907
What did you say, my boy?

52
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,800
"It's all over. " That's what you said. 

53
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:45,000
No... but it isn't all over. It's far from being all over.

54
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,439
Wait for us!

55
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:47,517
Open the door!

56
00:29:47,546 --> 00:29:48,468
Hey, let us in!

57
00:29:48,594 --> 00:29:51,218
You can't leave us here, of all places! Open up!

58
00:29:51,462 --> 00:29:52,295
Doctor!

59
00:30:20,604 --> 00:30:22,383
Doctor! Quick, help him!

60
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:23,714
No, leave him!
